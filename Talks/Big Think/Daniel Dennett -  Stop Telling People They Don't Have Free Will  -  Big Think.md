# Summary of Daniel Dennett: Stop Telling People They Don't Have Free Will | Big Think

Philosopher Daniel Dennett argues against the notion that free will is an illusion, pointing out that being told you don't have free will has harmful effects on people's decision-making processes. He cites a study where college students who were told that they didn't have free will were more likely to cheat on a puzzle, suggesting that people who lack a belief in their own agency are more likely to exhibit careless behaviours. Dennett argues that the idea of free will is crucial to human functioning and neuroscientists should refrain from claiming that it does not exist.

In this section, philosopher Daniel Dennett presents a thought experiment about a neurosurgeon who operates on a patient with OCD by inserting a microchip in his brain, which controls the disorder, but then lies to him that they will control every decision he makes from now on. The patient soon exhibits self-indulgent and harmful behavior, and when put on trial, he claims that he doesn't have free will because of the surgeon's deception. Dennett then argues that neuroscientists should stop saying that free will is an illusion because it can cause harm to people's morality and decision-making. He cites an experiment where college students who were told that they don't have free will became more likely to cheat on a puzzle, suggesting that claims about determinism can have negative effects on people's behavior.

Dennet cites a study where students who were told they didn't have free will went on to cheat at a higher rate, showing that people who lack a belief in their own agency are more likely to exhibit careless behaviours.
