In this section, Richard Reeves discusses the possibility of a "friendship recession," where people lack a certain number of close friends and have fewer people to turn to in times of crisis. He explains that traditional institutions, including religion and family, have declined, and as a result, there's more of a need for people to have social relationships outside of those institutions. However, during that same period, there has been a decline in the number of people who say that they have a number of close friends. Factors such as geographical mobility, parenting responsibilities, emphasis on work, and the breakdown of relationships contribute to this decline. Being without friends can not only make people isolated economically or socially, but it can also have a negative effect on their mental and physical health.

In this section, Richard Reeves discusses the "friendship recession" that the world is currently going through. He cites an alarming statistic that shows a fivefold increase in the number of men who claim to have no close friends today as compared to the 1990s. He also notes that women have been most affected by the pandemic, with half of them saying they lost touch with at least some of their friends because their friendship networks depend on regular physical contact. Reeves emphasizes that friendship is incredibly important for human flourishing and that people are wired to be social creatures, but friendships don't form themselves; they require work and vulnerability. It is important to acknowledge one's need for friendship and take steps to make friends, even if it means admitting to oneself and others that they need a friend.
