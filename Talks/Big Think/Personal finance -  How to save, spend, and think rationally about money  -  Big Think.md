They also suggest getting out of debt and saving up an emergency fund as ways to become financially independent.

Kahneman begins by discussing the need to be numerate in order to make sound financial decisions. He then argues that people should take the broad view when it comes to money and not have overly strong emotional reactions to events. Norton explains that money can buy happiness if it is spent correctly. He suggests that people focus on spending money on others instead of on themselves. Robin concludes by saying that when people become conscious of their spending, their consumption naturally decreases.
