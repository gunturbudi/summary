Ganesh Sitaraman discusses two distinct periods in the United States since World War II, the liberal era of regulated capitalism, and the neoliberal era of promoting individual responsibility over social interests. In the present day, there is growing opposition to neoliberal ideas, characterized by increasing inequality, consolidation in markets, and diminished opportunities, in both politics and private sectors. Consequently, new ideas are emerging that aim to promote social and public benefits by reshaping the rules in different ways.

In this section, Ganesh Sitaraman explains the two distinct eras that the United States has experienced since World War II. The first was a liberal era, an era of regulated capitalism that operated between state control and laissez-faire, where big government, big business, and big labor aimed to provide social goods for Americans. The second was an era defined by neoliberalism, which emerged in the early 1980s, and it aimed to have individuals responsible for themselves rather than having government, corporations, and unions balancing social interests. However, this era was characterized by increasing inequality, a reduction in opportunity for many people, and an increase in consolidation in markets. The neoliberal era is ending, and people are challenging neoliberal ideas in politics and the private sector by putting forward bold new policy ideas that aim to shape the rules in a different way to promote social good and other social and public benefits.
