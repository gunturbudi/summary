In a YouTube video, economist Tyler Cowen discusses the two futures of cryptocurrency - skeptics view it as a scheme that will ultimately become a bubble, whereas optimists believe that it will pave the way for new forms of money, investment and even computing. Cowen points out that people are paid in Bitcoin for validating records, creating a recordkeeping system using cryptocurrency. He expresses some skepticism but acknowledges that crypto has the potential to become a new institution for a global internet-based economy with secure property rights and new investment assets, creating a new system validated by blockchain that allows for the movement of resources around the world more easily and cheaply.

In this section, economist Tyler Cowen discusses the skeptical and optimistic views surrounding cryptocurrency. He explains how crypto functions as a recordkeeping system that pays people in Bitcoin to validate records and how it can potentially create new kinds of money, investment assets, and computers. Cowen expresses skepticism toward individuals who have grand plans for crypto but haven't thought through how they'll carry them out, while also acknowledging the potential for crypto. He discusses reasons for crypto-skepticism, including cyber attacks using crypto for ransoms, the impact on the environment due to high energy consumption, and the unrealistic expectations for promised benefits. However, Cowen argues that the bullish case for crypto involves it becoming a new institution for a more global, internet-based economy with secure property rights and new investment assets. He explains that this could involve a new system validated by the blockchain where resources can move around the world more easily and cheaply.
