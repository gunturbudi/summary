Sean Carroll discusses the mind-bending physics of time, explaining that time is just a label we use to distinguish different moments in the universe. He argues that time has no inherent direction and that the arrow of time is simply due to our location on Earth. He goes on to say that entropy is a natural tendency for systems to increase in disorder, and that the Past Hypothesis explains the origin of everything that has happened since the Big Bang.

The author discusses the concept of time, explaining that time is just a label we use to distinguish different moments in the universe. The author argues that time has no inherent direction- it exists equally in the past, present and future- and that the arrow of time is simply due to our location on Earth. He goes on to say that entropy is a natural tendency for systems to increase in disorder, and that the Past Hypothesis- the idea that the entropy of the universe started low- explains the origin of everything that has happened since the Big Bang.

Sean Carroll talks about entropy and how it is responsible for the existence of complex structures, like living beings. He argues that if entropy were already maxed out, there would be no complexity and no life. He goes on to say that entropy is increasing along the way, and that this is what leads to the existence of complex structures in the Universe.
