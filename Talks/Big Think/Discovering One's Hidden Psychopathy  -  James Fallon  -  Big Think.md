# Summary of Discovering One's Hidden Psychopathy | James Fallon | Big Think

Neuroscientist James Fallon discovered that he has psychopathic tendencies through biological evidence and genetic alleles associated with violent and aggressive behavior, low anxiety, and low empathy. Despite not fitting the criteria for a full-blown psychopath, his narcissism, ability to manipulate, hold grudges, and get even without others noticing all fall under the spectrum of psychopathy. As he has gotten older, Fallon has tried to use his sense of narcissism to overcome his psychopathic tendencies and has started to consider the right thing to do in each situation with others to change his behavior.

In this section, James Fallon discusses his personal story of discovering that he has psychopathic tendencies through biological evidence. After being involved in PET scans and genetics studies for Alzheimer's, he discovered a strange pattern in the brain activity of killers and psychopaths. Later, when he received his own results, he realized that he had the same genetic alleles associated with high aggression and violence, psychopathy, low empathy, and low anxiety. Despite initially not taking the discovery seriously, a meeting with psychiatrists in Oslo made him finally realize that his behaviors matched those of a borderline psychopath.

In this section, neuroscientist James Fallon discusses how his discovery of being a borderline psychopath changed the way he viewed himself and his interactions with others. Despite having many psychopathic traits, he doesn't fit the criteria of a full-blown psychopath as he has never been involved in criminal behavior. Fallon's ability to manipulate, his narcissism, and his willingness to get revenge without others noticing are all traits that fall under the spectrum of psychopathy. One of the most prominent indicators of his psychopathy is his ability to get angry but never show it, hold a grudge for years, and eventually get even. However, as Fallon has gotten older, he admits he has tried to use his sense of narcissism to overcome his psychopathic tendencies.
