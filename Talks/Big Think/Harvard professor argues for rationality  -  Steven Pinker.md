Steven Pinker, a professor of psychology at Harvard, argues that progress has occurred because humans deploy rationality - their cognitive ability - in the pursuit of making others better off. This is often difficult to do, as there are many obstacles in the way, but it is possible with enough effort. He also warns of the dangers of irrationality, which can lead to public health disasters, wars, and genocides.

Steven Pinker argues that rationality is a product of institutions, such as scientific societies, government recordkeeping agencies, and responsible journalistic outlets. These institutions have rules that help us be more rational than any of us is individually. However, rationality cannot be achieved instantaneously, and there will always be pockets of irrationality.
