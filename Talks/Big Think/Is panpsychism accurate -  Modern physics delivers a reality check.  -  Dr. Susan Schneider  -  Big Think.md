Dr. Susan Schneider discusses the concept of panpsychism and its lack of compatibility with modern physics, specifically the contradiction between relativity theory and quantum mechanics. She suggests the possibility of protospace and prototime at the fundamental level, leading to the idea of panprotopsychism, but emphasizes that current scientific work on fundamental particles must be engaged with to determine whether such particles could be similar to mental subjects or experiences.

In this section, Dr. Susan Schneider discusses panpsychism and how it does not mesh with modern physics due to the contradiction between relativity theory and quantum mechanics. While some theories claim that space and time are emergent and fundamental ingredients are non-spatial, which poses a problem for the idea of the fundamental ingredients being subjects of experience. Schneider suggests that there may be protospace and prototime at the fundamental level, supporting the idea of panprotopsychism. Schneider emphasizes that philosophers making claims about panpsychism must engage with the current scientific work on fundamental particles and question whether such particles could be anything like mental subjects or experiences.
