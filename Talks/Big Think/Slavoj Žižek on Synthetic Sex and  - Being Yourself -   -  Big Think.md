In this section, philosopher Slavoj Žižek discusses the problem with online dating and the necessity of contingency in love. He points out that online dating involves self-commodification and an emphasis on presenting an idealized image of oneself, which does not accurately represent how love functions. Love, he argues, requires small imperfections or endearing foibles that make the object of desire more interesting. In psychoanalytic theory, this is referred to as the object cause of desire. While Žižek acknowledges the need for staging a certain image of oneself, he also believes that an excess of this will lead to the illusion of perfection, which is not true to human nature.
