Erin Meyer discusses how Netflix created a high-performing team by prioritizing talent density and weeding out underperformers through the Keeper Test. Unlike other companies that use processes like "Rank and Yank," Netflix encourages managers to reflect on how they would react if a high performer planned to leave the company. Meyer emphasizes the idea that an individual's lack of performance could affect the entire team and organization, and encourages leaders to focus on the bigger picture. Netflix's success in weeding out mediocre performers has contributed to the growth of the company.

In this section, Erin Meyer describes how Netflix sought to create an organization of top performers with minimal rules and processes. This led to the concept of talent density and the creation of a high-performing Olympic team. However, achieving such a team of top performers is a challenge. Unlike companies like GE and Microsoft who used "Rank and Yank" processes to weed out underperformers, Netflix developed the Keeper Test. The Keeper Test is a simple exercise where managers reflect on how they would react if a high performer informed them of plans to leave the company. If the reaction is positive and he would like to keep them, that's a keeper. If not, then the employee might not be the right fit and might take a toll on team performance.
