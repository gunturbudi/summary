# Summary of Neil deGrasse Tyson: 3 mind-blowing space facts | Big Think

Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson shares three mind-blowing space facts in a video for Big Think. Firstly, the presence of liquid water is essential for discovering life in the universe and Europa, a moon of Jupiter, has kept warm by tidal forces and may be the home to thriving life underneath its frozen surface. Secondly, the most volcanically active place in the solar system is Io, one of Jupiter's moons. Finally, 85% of the gravity in the universe has no known origin, which we call "dark matter." Tyson speculates that the likely existence of subatomic particles making up this "dark matter" lack interaction with our particles as neutrinos do. Tyson concludes the video by explaining the Coriolis force, with the help of a football analogy.

In this section, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson explains how finding liquid water is important for discovering life in the universe, and how Europa, a moon of Jupiter kept warm not just from the sun but from tidal forces, could be home to thriving life underneath its frozen surface. This has opened up the possibility that life may exist beyond the Goldilocks Zone, and other moons could house the same phenomenon of sustaining heat from tidal stress forces. The discovery also shows how life could be thriving in extreme conditions.

In this section, Neil deGrasse Tyson discusses two mind-blowing space facts: the most volcanically active place in the solar system is Io, one of Jupiter's moons, and 85% of the gravity in the universe has no known origin, which is referred to as "dark matter" but should actually be called "dark gravity" since it's not confirmed to be matter. Tyson thinks there might be a family of particles, subatomic particles that don't interact with our particles, that make up dark matter. He likens this to neutrinos, which are part of our family of particles but hardly interact with familiar matter at all.

In this section, Neil deGrasse Tyson discusses dark matter and how it does not interact with us or with itself, which means it is not found in concentrations like normal matter. Due to this lack of interaction, dark matter is spread out diffusely across the universe. He then uses a sports analogy to explain the Coriolis force and how it affects field goals in football, which is caused by the rotation of the Earth and creates the circulation of storms.
