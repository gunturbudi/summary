Déjà vu is a feeling that a person has experienced a situation before, even if they haven't. It is thought to be caused by the brain remembering fragments of previous situations. Quantum physics suggests that there may be parallel universes, but we can't enter them because we have decohered from them.

Déjà vu is a phenomenon that all of us have experienced, that eerie feeling when you walk into a room or enter a new situation and you say to yourself, "I've been here before. I mean, everything here is familiar."

Déjà vu is likely just a fragment of our brain eliciting memories and fragments of previous situations, but in quantum physics there really are in some sense parallel universes surrounding us, the problem is, we can't enter them because we have decohered from them.
