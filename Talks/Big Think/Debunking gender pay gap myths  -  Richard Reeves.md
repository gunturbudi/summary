Richard Reeves acknowledges that the gender pay gap exists but suggests that it is not a result of employers discriminating against women. He highlights factors such as women occupying lower-paid jobs and the difference in child-rearing and childcare responsibilities between men and women. He offers solutions such as redesigning career ladders and offering more generous maternity leave to address the gender pay gap. Additionally, Reeves emphasizes the need for fathers to take a more active role in parenting beyond just the early years, as parenting is a marathon, not a sprint. While the gender pay gap has been shrinking, structural obstacles to progress remain and there is a need for continued effort in this area.

In this section, Richard Reeves, as he debunks myths about the gender pay gap, acknowledges that the pay gap does exist, but itâ€™s not as a result of employers discriminating against women. It is because of several factors, including the fact that women tend to occupy lower-paid jobs and the difference in child-rearing and childcare responsibilities between men and women. Women tend to take more time off work to care for their children compared to men, which affects their earnings trajectories. Reeves suggests that giving women more generous maternity leave and redesigning career ladders to reduce the impact of taking time off work or working part-time could help address the gender pay gap problem.

Reeves states that the gender pay gap has been shrinking over the last few decades, but some of the structural obstacles to continued progress, which mostly affect women, have become much clearer.
