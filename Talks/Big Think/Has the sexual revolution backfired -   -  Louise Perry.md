Louise Perry discusses the impact of the sexual revolution, arguing that the 'sex-positive feminist' movement is problematic as it can justify abusive sexual practices and power imbalances. Society's current incentive structure incentivizes viewing sex as an aspirational activity, but imitating male sexuality doesn't always serve young women's interests. Perry also discusses the sociosexuality gap, where more men than women are willing to engage in casual sex, and argues that instead of encouraging women to engage in more casual sex, efforts should focus on persuading men to approach sex more like women.

In this section, Louise Perry discusses her views on the sexual revolution. She believes that the 'sex-positive feminist' movement is problematic, as it is being used to justify abusive sexual practices and any form of power imbalance in sexual relationships. She also argues that society's current incentive structure places an emphasis on viewing sex as an aspirational activity, and this is because of all the changes that have occurred over the years. The Pill has allowed women to live like men in terms of their professional lives and sexuality. However, she argues that imitating male sexuality doesn't always serve young women's interests. Women feel like they don't have many options but to have emotionless sex and imitate male sexuality, which is becoming increasingly problematic.

In this section, Louise Perry discusses the potential exploitation that can occur when some people are inherently more powerful than others in a sexual culture. Men, on average, tend to have a higher sociosexuality level (willingness to engage in casual sex) than women. This leads to a sociosexuality gap where there are a lot more men eager to have casual sex than there are women who are willing to. Some cultures have used prostitution as a solution, but Perry believes this is wrong as it exploits women. Instead, she argues that a truly feminist project should focus on persuading men to have sex more like women, rather than trying to persuade women to have more casual sex like men.
