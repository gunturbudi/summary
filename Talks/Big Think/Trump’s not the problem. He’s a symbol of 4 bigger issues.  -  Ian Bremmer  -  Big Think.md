# Summary of Trump’s not the problem. He’s a symbol of 4 bigger issues. | Ian Bremmer | Big Think

Ian Bremmer argues that Trump is not the problem, but rather a symbol of four larger issues affecting advanced industrial democracies: economic inequality, anti-immigrant sentiment, disillusionment with foreign policy, and the divisive effects of technology. He warns that these issues are threatening the fabric of civic nationalism and will only intensify as economic conditions worsen. Bremmer notes that Japan is the only wealthy democracy that has not experienced these issues due to its rejection of globalism, lack of economic erosion, strict immigration policies, constitutional restrictions on military involvement in wars, and limited use of social media in politics.

In this section, Ian Bremmer argues that Trump is not the problem, but rather a symptom of larger issues affecting the advanced industrial democracies of the world. These issues include economic inequality among the working and middle classes, anti-immigrant sentiment, disillusionment with foreign policy, and the divisive effects of technology. Bremmer warns that these issues are driving a wedge between citizens, threatening the fabric of civic nationalism, and will only intensify as economic conditions worsen. He notes that only one advanced industrial democracy - Japan - has not experienced these issues, suggesting the need for a different approach to governance and acknowledging that this is a structural condition that we have been ignoring for decades.

In this section, Ian Bremmer argues that Japan is the only wealthy democracy that does not experience a crisis of democracy because it rejects globalism and its precepts. Japan's economy may not be growing per capita, but their population is shrinking fast, so they don't feel the economic erosion of the working class. They also let in almost no immigrants, and their military is constitutionally forbidden from going abroad and fighting in wars. Moreover, the Japanese government has worked hard to keep social media out of the political space, and the average Japanese adult is not on social media.
