The video discusses the findings of a study that suggests that romantic love is an addiction that is adapted to ensure long-term partnerships are maintained. The study found activity in three brain regions linked with addiction when someone is in love long-term. These findings suggest that the feelings of intense romantic love and the sex drive are adaptations that evolved to help people maintain long-term relationships.

Helen Fisher discusses the existence of three brain systems that evolved for mating and reproduction- sex drive, feelings of intense romantic love, and feelings of deep attachment. She explains that all three systems are important when someone is in love, even if the person is still in a romantic relationship. Fisher also discusses the effects of being dumped, and how being in love does not stop after a person is rejected.

The video discusses a study that found activity in three brain regions linked with addiction when someone is in love long-term. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) pumps out dopamine, which gives people feelings of intense romantic love, and a brain region in the hypothalamus linked with the sex drive is also active. Finally, another brain region linked with attachment is also active. These findings suggest that romantic love is an addiction that is adaptations to ensure long-term partnerships are maintained.
