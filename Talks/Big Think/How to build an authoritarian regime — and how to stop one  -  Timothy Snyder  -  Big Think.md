# Summary of How to build an authoritarian regime â€” and how to stop one | Timothy Snyder | Big Think

Historian Timothy Snyder explains in a Big Think video that for democracy to function, there must be a shared factual world that citizens and leaders agree on, which authoritarian regimes try to reduce the salience of, and instead, they focus on emotions to divide or unite people. The internet allows anonymous actors to bypass rational thought and target the emotional centers of people's brains, while machine learning algorithms reinforce people's biases by giving them what they want to hear. Snyder suggests that local news production should be funded as a public good and labeled as a positive public support for the state to help stop the destruction of factuality. Further, he notes that investigative journalism must be treated similarly to a public good and given public support.

In this section, historian Timothy Snyder discusses the impact of new media on society, arguing that it is not inherently good for democracy just because it increases connectivity and speed. He explains that for democracy to function, there must be a shared factual world that citizens and leaders agree on, which forms the basis for evaluating policies and taking actions. Authoritarian regimes, therefore, try to reduce the salience of this factual world and instead focus on emotions to divide or unite people. The internet allows anonymous actors to bypass rational thought and target the emotional centers of people's brains, while machine learning algorithms reinforce people's biases by giving them what they want to hear.

In this section, Timothy Snyder discusses the need to take responsibility for the production of local news, which is crucial for factuality, and therefore democracy, freedom, and the rule of law. Snyder notes that the first step of an authoritarian regime is usually to eliminate local news so that people stop trusting reporters they know and begin distrusting the media as a whole, leading to people looking for other sources, including the conspiracy theories that lead to the further destruction of factuality. Snyder suggests treating factuality destruction as an externality, taxing big companies that contribute to its elimination and then using that money to support local news production. Snyder further advises that investigative journalism should be reclassified as a public good, deserving of positive public support from the state, and that other technical means could be used to correct the inequalities between real news and fake news.
