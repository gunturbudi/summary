# Summary of The Neuroscience of Creativity, Perception, and Confirmation Bias | Beau Lotto | Big Think

Beau Lotto discusses the importance of uncertainty and how our brains are wired to avoid it. However, creativity and seeing differently begin with a question and not knowing. Our assumptions and perception processes are both our constraint and savior, and it is essential to identify and question assumptions to be able to see differently. Understanding the process of perception and being aware of our assumptions is crucial to seeing differently and stimulating creativity. Lotto also explains that creativity only appears creative from the outside because the observer has a different space of possibility with different assumptions and biases compared to the creative person. Therefore, creativity depends on an individual's assumptions, biases, and the complexity of their space of possibility.

In this section, Beau Lotto discusses the importance of uncertainty and how our brain is wired to avoid it. He explains that we do almost everything to avoid uncertainty, as it causes stress, increases brain cell death, and makes us an extreme version of ourselves. However, creativity and seeing differently begin with a question and not knowing. Our assumptions and perception processes are both our constraint and savior, and it is essential to identify and question assumptions to be able to see differently. However, questioning assumptions is difficult as the brain evolved to avoid uncertainty, and we tend to look for evidence to confirm what we assume to be true already, leading to confirmation bias. The brain only makes small steps in its ideas, and our space of possibility is determined by our assumptions. Therefore, understanding the process of perception and being aware of our assumptions is crucial to seeing differently and stimulating creativity.

In this section, Beau Lotto discusses how creativity is perceived from both the inside and outside. He explains that creativity is only creative from the outside because for the person being creative, they're just making a small logical next step based on their assumptions and biases. The reason why it appears that they're connecting two things that are far apart is that the observer has a different space of possibility with different assumptions and biases. Therefore, creativity depends on an individual's assumptions, biases, and the complexity of their space of possibility.
