Laurence Steinberg makes the argument that Asian-American students outperform white students in American schools due to different expectations set by parents and peers. He goes on to say that schools need to take into account the different contexts in which kids grow up, and that various reforms need to be put into place in order to improve student achievement.

The study found that Asian-American students perform better than white students in American schools, and that this difference is largely due to different expectations among parents and peers. The study also found that different ethnic groups have different beliefs about the importance of schooling, with Asian-American students tending to have the most positive outlook. The study found no evidence of any of the various reforms that have been tried in the past 30 years having any impact on student achievement.

Laurence Steinberg argues that there is a very small relationship between the resources a school gets and the output it produces. He also argues that schools need to think about the whole context in which kids grow up, not just what takes place inside the classroom. He believes that we need to change standards, engage parents more in children's education, and redesign tests to better measure what students are supposed to learn.
