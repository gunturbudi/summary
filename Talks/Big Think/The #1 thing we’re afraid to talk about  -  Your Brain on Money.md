People are more comfortable talking about sex, war, trauma, and religion than money, but this doesn't mean that money is a taboo topic. There are certain decisions that involve taboos or sacred values that are handled differently in the world of decision-making, and this is why money is a taboo topic. Our two neuroscientists, Dr. Joseph Kable and Dr. Moran Cerf, are going to show us what's happening inside our head when we negotiate or make a decision around money that involves a taboo. Our ancestors, back in the days, when they lived in small groups, didn't need to worry about standing out or being perfect with money because everything was shared.
