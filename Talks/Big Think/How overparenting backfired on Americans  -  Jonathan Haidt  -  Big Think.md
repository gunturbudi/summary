Jonathan Haidt discusses how overparenting in America backfired since the 1990s, following a fear of child abductions and resulting in a lack of essential independence skills developed by children. Members of Gen Z have more difficulty working out problems independently and often get easily offended. Solutions include limiting device and social media usage and developing common policies with schools and organizations, like Letgrow.org, that help kids develop independence skills vital to becoming a successful adult.

In this section of the video, Jonathan Haidt discusses how American parenting changed in the 1990s when a fear of child abductions arose. Americans started to think that if they take their eyes off their children, they will be abducted. As a result, they began to supervise their children all the time, and kids were not allowed to go out without adult supervision until much later than before. This essential period of childhood, when kids have practiced independence for years throughout history, was taken away, and kids are now not used to being independent. Members of Gen Z have more difficulty working out problems on their own and may get offended easily. To solve these problems, Haidt suggests limiting device use and social media and developing common policies with the help of schools and organizations, such as Letgrow.org, that allows kids to develop independence skills that are essential to becoming a successful adult.
