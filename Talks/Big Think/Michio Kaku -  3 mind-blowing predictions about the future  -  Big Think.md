In a video titled "Michio Kaku: 3 mind-blowing predictions about the future | Big Think," futurist and physicist Michio Kaku discusses three predictions for the future of humanity. Firstly, Kaku suggests that in the future, Earth could become a park and heavy industries and pollution could be shifted to outer space. Secondly, he discusses the potential of direct brain-computer interfaces that could revolutionize the way we interact with technology, and thirdly, Kaku discusses the fourth wave of scientific innovation that encompasses artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, and biotechnology, which will revolutionize the job market and have the potential to eradicate cancer.

In this section, Michio Kaku discusses the possibilities of making Earth a park by shifting heavy industries and pollution to outer-space, and also the probability of a planet buster hitting Earth, making it necessary for humans to become a two-planet species. Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are working on making Mars colonization and making Earth a park respectively. Michio Kaku discusses the possibility of sending starships and how it could happen in the future through mini-parachutes energized by laser beams. Additionally, if humans want to colonize Mars successfully, it is necessary to create self-replicating robots capable of building colonies and expanding them.

In this section, Michio Kaku discusses the potential of direct brain-computer interfaces and the evolution of computer chips, which could be as ubiquitous as contact lenses. People will be able to connect their minds with the internet, allowing them to send memories, emotions, and communicate telepathically. Kaku also mentions how the Pentagon has donated over $150 million to research in this field and that the possibilities of a brain-computer interface could be as revolutionary as previous scientific projects such as the Genome Project and the Manhattan Project.

In this section, Michio Kaku discusses the fourth wave of scientific innovation, which encompasses artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, and biotechnology. He explains that biotechnology and artificial intelligence will revolutionize the job market as people work to find cures for age-related illnesses such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Furthermore, nanomedicine will help to eradicate cancer using individual molecules in the cells to target cancerous cells. In the future, our toilets will become our first line of defense against cancer, as we will be able to detect cancer colonies years before they form tumors, effectively eradicating cancer much like we have learned to live with the common cold.
