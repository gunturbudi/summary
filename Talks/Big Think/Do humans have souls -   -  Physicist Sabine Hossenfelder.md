Physicist Sabine Hossenfelder argues that it isn't necessary to add anything to the fundamental laws of physics to explain whether humans have souls, as humans are made up of fundamental particles which are important not in themselves but because of what they can do and the information contained within them. She suggests that it should be possible to upload one's identity and entire body to a computer by mathematically formulating all information about the configuration of the atoms in the body, with this information then put onto a computer.

In this section, physicist Sabine Hossenfelder discusses whether humans have souls and states that it's not necessary to add anything to the fundamental laws of nature that have already been collected in physics to describe our observations and experiences. She explains that we are made up of fundamental particles that make up everything around us, and that the only thing that's important is what particles can do and the information contained in how they are arranged to make up a human body rather than the particles themselves. This means that it should be possible to upload one's identity and entire body to a computer by formulating all the information about the configuration of the atoms in the body in mathematics and then putting it onto a computer.
