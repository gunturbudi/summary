# Summary of Memories Are Really Fantasies

The speaker in the video discusses how memories can become fantasies and how the brain's active process of memory can change what is remembered over time. Recalling memories is an active process, and each step can be altered, leading to interference and false memories. Memories can be stored in a way that blends fantasy with reality, and as time passes, certain aspects can disappear. People often fill in the gaps with other aspects just to remember. Memories are active processes that can change over time and are not just passive recordings.

In this section, the speaker discusses how memories can become fantasies and how the brain's active process of memory can change what is remembered over time. Memories can be stored in a way that confuses fantasy with reality, leading to the wrong perception of what was seen or experienced. As time passes, certain aspects of memories can disappear, and people might fill in the gaps with other aspects just to remember. Recalling a memory is also an active process, and each step in the process can be labelled or changed, which can lead to interference and false memories. Overall, memories are not just passive recordings; they are active processes that can change over time.
