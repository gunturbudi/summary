Physicist Sabine Hossenfelder discusses how Einstein's theory of relativity challenges the concept of a universal present moment, as everything we experience is actually in the past. She describes the block universe, where the past, present, and future exist in the same way, and suggests that there is a timeless quality to the information that makes up humans, and everything else in the universe, which can provide spiritual insight. However, she acknowledges that this concept can be difficult to grasp intuitively. This highlights the importance of questioning our understanding of time and its relationship to concepts such as the afterlife.

In this section, physicist Sabine Hossenfelder explains how Einstein's theory of special relativity challenges the idea of a universal present moment. According to Einstein, the finite speed of light means that everything we experience is actually in the past, and there is no unambiguous notion of a shared "now" that we can all agree on. As a result, every moment could be "now" for someone, including those in the future and past. This ambiguity highlights the importance of questioning our understanding of time and how we think about concepts such as the afterlife.

In this section, physicist Sabine Hossenfelder explains Einstein's concept of the block universe, where the present moment is not fundamentally significant, and the past, present, and future exist in the same way. Hossenfelder discusses the idea that all the fundamental laws of nature work in a way where information cannot be destroyed, but it can be impossible to retrieve. She suggests that the information that makes up humans and everything else in the universe is something timeless, and there is a deep spiritual insight that can be gained from studying the foundations of physics. However, Hossenfelder admits that it can be difficult to make intuitive sense of it.
