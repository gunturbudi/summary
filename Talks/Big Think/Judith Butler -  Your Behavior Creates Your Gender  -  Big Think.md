In this section, Judith Butler discusses the difference between saying that gender is performed versus saying that gender is performative. To say that gender is performative means that it produces a series of effects as we act and speak in ways that confirm our gender identity. Butler argues that gender is a phenomenon that is being produced and reproduced all the time, and nobody is a gender from the start. She also addresses the difficulties that sissy boys and tomboys face in attempting to function socially without being bullied or ridiculed, and the institutional and informal powers that work to keep individuals in their gendered place. Finally, Butler emphasizes that gender is culturally formed, but also a domain of agency and freedom, and that it's crucial to resist violence imposed by ideal gender norms, especially for those who are nonconforming in their gender presentation.
