# Summary of How Memory Works

The video explains how memory works, and how recordings of events happening at the same time are activated based on signals sent through convergence and divergence. This process of retro activation allows for the reconstruction of memories, which can be more accurate than actual recordings due to their fragmented nature and the possibility of error.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
The memory process is complex and involves multiple regions of the brain. The memory is not just a simple "movie" that is experienced in one single location. There are multiple layers of processing going on, and the memory can be reactivated later on.

The video discusses how memory works, and explains how recordings of simultaneity (events happening at the same time) are activated based on signals sent through convergence and divergence. This process of retro activation allows for the reconstruction of memories, which can be more accurate than actual recordings due to their fragmented nature and the possibility of error.
