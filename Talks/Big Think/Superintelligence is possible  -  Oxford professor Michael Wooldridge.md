Oxford professor Michael Wooldridge discusses the history and current limitations of artificial intelligence (AI), as well as the Hollywood dream of creating conscious machines with the same intellectual capabilities as human beings. He notes that achieving this grand dream of artificial general intelligence (AGI) would mean having machines that can deal with many social relationships and possess social intelligence, a trait characteristic of human intelligence. However, he suggests that this will be a slow and arduous process that requires development of social skills in AI such as cooperation and negotiation. While conscious machines are logically possible, there is no clear path to creating them as consciousness itself is poorly understood in humans. Finally, he argues that the limits of computing are not bound by physical materials, but rather by human imagination.

In this section, Oxford professor Michael Wooldridge discusses the Hollywood dream of AI and the possibility of creating machines that are conscious, potentially in the same way that human beings are. He also talks about the history of AI, from its name coined by John McCarthy to the symbolic AI approach of recreating human reasoning to the more recent machine learning approach of showing machines what you want them to do and letting them learn. He also notes that contemporary AI is focused on getting AI systems to do very narrow tasks, but achieving the grand dream of AGI would mean having machines with the same intellectual capabilities as human beings.

In this section, Professor Wooldridge discusses the idea that human intelligence is social intelligence, a trait resulting from our need to deal with many social relationships. He also notes that while conscious machines are logically possible, there is no clear path to creating them as consciousness itself is poorly understood in humans. Additionally, he argues that the limits of computing are not bound by physical materials but rather by human imagination. The development of social skills in AI, such as cooperation and negotiation, will be a vital step towards conscious machines, but this will be a slow and arduous process.
