# Summary of Steven Pinker: On Free Will | Big Think

In his talk "On Free Will" for Big Think, Steven Pinker argues that free will in the sense of a spirit or soul controlling behavior does not exist, and that human behavior is the result of physical processes in the brain, which are complex and unpredictable. However, he acknowledges that there is a part of the brain responsible for choosing behaviors that involve mental models of the world and the ability to predict the outcomes of possible behaviors, which he distinguishes as free will from involuntary reflexes.
