According to Richard Reeves, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, the reasons behind declining marriage rates in the US are the displacement and alteration of traditional reasons for getting married; the role of men has changed, women are exerting more power in relationships, and the institution of marriage has undergone a fundamental transformation thanks to the women's movement, shattering deep-seated inequality between men and women. The model of marriage based on economic dependency is obsolete, with people seeking more egalitarian models of the family to create stability in family life without sacrificing gender equality. If marriage is to survive, it will need to adapt to this new reality rather than clinging to the old model.

In this section, Richard Reeves, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and author, talks about the reasons behind declining marriage rates in the US. He notes that traditional reasons for getting married, such as religion, romance, economics, and status, have been displaced or altered. Marriage is no longer a necessity for an economic or parental bond, the role of men has changed and women are using exit power from marriages more, thus forming more egalitarian principles. The institution of marriage has fundamentally transformed, and women's movement has shattered the deep inequality between men and women. However, class gaps are opening up, with fewer working-class and lower-income Americans opting into the institution, resulting in a significant shift up in the age of the first marriage, up to closer to 30 now. Marriage has become more like the capstone rather than the beginning of a journey, and Americans are less likely to see marriage as necessary.

In this section, Richard Reeves explains that the model of marriage, based on the notion of economic dependency of women on men, is now obsolete. While marriage may still have a role to play in creating stable family environments for raising children, people are looking for more egalitarian and fairer models of the family. The goal is to create stability in family life without sacrificing equality between men and women. Ultimately, if marriage is to survive, it will need to adapt to this new reality rather than clinging to the old model.
