In this section, Steven Kotler discusses the three motivators that can help us achieve peak performance: curiosity, passion, and purpose. He explains how curiosity fosters focus and how passion may be useful, but purpose is the most effective peak performance motivator. Once we have a purpose, the system demands autonomy which leads to mastery, the skills necessary to pursue that purpose well. Flow is universal in most mammals, including humans, and is capable of amplifying performance beyond all reasonable expectations.
