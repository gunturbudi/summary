In this ultimate guide to rationality, Steven Pinker emphasizes the importance of rationality in understanding progress and achieving deeper knowledge and understanding. He highlights the key role institutions play in promoting rationality and truth-seeking and warns against political monoculture that can corrode credibility. Pinker also discusses different cognitive illusions, Bayesian reasoning, and the tragedy of the commons, emphasizing the need for objectivity, truth-seeking, and impartiality in rationality. Ultimately, Pinker argues that individuals need to have a scientific mindset and consume information in a mind-friendly format that is compatible with the way humans experience things in their lives.
Steven Pinker discusses the limitations of Bayesian reasoning in sensitive areas where fairness and morality should be prioritized. While Bayesian reasoning can be useful in understanding the world, relying solely on it in certain scenarios, such as courtrooms and college admissions, can promote discrimination. Pinker also notes that journalists and even some science journalism often fall victim to the availability bias, relying on images and anecdotes without providing quantitative data. He suggests that people must consciously employ Bayesian reasoning as a cognitive tool and integrate critical thinking principles into everyday norms to become more rational. Despite our susceptibility to fallacies and irrational thinking, Pinker claims that people have made immense progress in avoiding irrational beliefs and can collectively steer towards greater rationality.

In this section, Steven Pinker explains why rationality matters in understanding the phenomenon of progress. In the past, he has presented graphs and statistics that show the decline in violence, deaths in war and crime, and an increase in happiness, prosperity, freedom, and democracy over time. He also notes that progress doesn't occur naturally, as there are many factors like entropy, human nature's dark side, pathogens that can work against it. However, he believes that cognitive abilities and communication skills make us capable of pushing back these negative forces and promoting positive changes. Pinker also highlights that human progress can be measured by the increase in health, wealth, and wisdom, as people globally live longer and experience reduced maternal mortality rates, fewer children dying, and rare famines.

In this section, Pinker discusses the progress made in several dimensions of human well-being in recent times. Technological advancements such as crop rotation, hybrid seeds, and synthetic fertilizers have helped to reduce famines, which were once considered punishments from a divine source. A vast majority of people in the world can read and write, which was not the case a couple of centuries ago. Rates of interpersonal violence have reduced, and wars have become less frequent, shorter, and less damaging after World War II. Leisure time has increased, suicides have gone down globally, and opportunities in the richness of life such as travel, ethnic foods, and music have increased.

00:10:00
In this section, Pinker discusses how he considers himself a data-driven realist rather than an optimist when it comes to human progress. He encourages people to look beyond sensational headlines and see how smaller, gradual improvements have contributed to progress in areas such as medicine, technology, and reducing violence. He also acknowledges that while humans have achieved remarkable feats of rationality, there is also a lot of irrationality in the world, such as conspiracy theories and fake news. Pinker explains that the key to promoting rationality is through institutions that encourage open debate, criticism, and free speech, allowing for checks and balances to help us blunder our way towards truth.

00:15:00
In this section, Pinker emphasizes the importance of following certain rules of the game for collective rationality, where individuals can correct each other based on data, facts, and experiments, and solutions grow stronger as we work together. He acknowledges that humans plan and navigate their daily lives according to logic, but when it comes to phenomena that can't be experienced firsthand, we must trust the institutions of science, history, and record-keeping that work to understand them. According to Pinker, the problem is that individuals tend to gravitate towards the most comfortable stories that support their own interest and perspectives and often refuse to trust these institutions. Such mistrust can lead to threats to rationality, as we've seen in trends like authoritarian-nationalist and populist-right, that disregard scientific findings, and prioritize the collective interest of the nation.

00:20:00
In this section, Steven Pinker discusses the suppression of opinion and speech in woke left culture and cancel culture which disable progress, the engine of which is broaching and evaluating ideas. He highlights how courts of justice and liberal democracy are products of Enlightenment values that need maintenance, defense, and upkeep. The introduction of new technologies tends to increase irrational thinking due to the Wild West of misinformation that gets shared. To clean up this act, codes of ethics, accuracy, fact-checking, and error correction were established to instill trust. Pinker notes that until recently, most doctors were quacks, and it was a pride point to have blood and bodily fluids all over the coat. However, with the acceptance of antisepsis, things changed for the better.

00:25:00
In this section of the transcript, Steven Pinker discusses the importance of institutions in rationality and truth-seeking. He explains that institutions such as academia, scientific societies, and responsible journalism are crucial for achieving the Enlightenment's ideals of deeper knowledge and understanding. However, institutions must maintain their credibility by ensuring diversity of ideas and viewpoints rather than existing within a political monoculture. Steven Pinker warns that institutions must not lose sight of their purpose by forming their own tribe and using campaigns of intimidation, which can stifle rationality and corrode their credibility.

00:30:00
In this section, Pinker discusses the concept of pluralistic ignorance, in which individuals assume that beliefs are popular or common, leading to the entrenchment of those beliefs even if they aren't actually popular. This can be exacerbated by punishment or the fear of punishment for heterodox beliefs or questioning the consensus. Pinker argues that having spaces where people can express their beliefs without punishment is critical. He also explores game theory and the tragedy of the commons, which describes the rational choices of individuals leading to everyone being worse off. This concept can be applied to rationality itself, where individuals may believe in something not because it's true but because it benefits their social standing, which can lead to groups with individually rational but false beliefs.

00:35:00
In this section, Pinker discusses the tragedy of the rationality commons and its contribution to political polarization. He explains that individuals may prioritize ratifying the beliefs of their tribe, but this is irrational for society as a whole. Objectivity, truth-seeking, and impartiality are necessary norms that need to be implemented for everyone to enjoy what is objectively good for all. He goes on to explain how the human mind relies on storytelling to make sense of the world, but often these narratives can be more entertaining than accurate, especially when it comes to big, important questions. Pinker also addresses cognitive illusions and how they contribute to irrationality.

00:40:00
In this section, Steven Pinker discusses classic cognitive illusions such as the availability bias and representativeness that explain what makes us tick but are not enough to explain why people believe in things like QAnon. Pinker delves into other parts of human psychology that could explain these "nutball" beliefs. He explains how many beliefs have a strong moral component and are more in the realm of mythology. People often believe in them not because they are true but because they are good things to believe in for their moral community. Pinker encourages people to have a scientific mindset in which they only believe things that are true rather than pleasing narratives. Lastly, he explains Bayesian reasoning and how it requires extraordinary evidence for extraordinary claims.

00:45:00
In this section, Steven Pinker discusses Bayesian reasoning, which is a mathematical formula that helps us assign degrees of belief to an idea based on the strength of the evidence. The formula has four terms, and the first term is called the priors, which is an individual's belief in something before seeing any evidence. Bayes' theorem assumes that the priors should be based on past data and established theories. The second term is the likelihood, which refers to how likely it is that someone would see the evidence if the hypothesis is true. Lastly, if the evidence is common, it is less likely that it supports the hypothesis. Pinker emphasizes that people are oftentimes poor Bayesian reasoners because they forget to take into account the base rate when assigning probabilities to an idea.

00:50:00
In this section, Pinker discusses how people tend to neglect Bayesian reasoning and struggle to interpret the results of medical tests in experiments. He explains how doctors, as well as the general population, make the mistake of not factoring in a low base rate, leading them to believe that the likelihood of having the disease is much higher than it actually is. Pinker provides a solution to this problem by reframing the problem in the context of frequency, rather than probability, which makes the problem more intuitive and helps people to better understand the concept of Bayesian reasoning. Ultimately, Pinker concludes that people are not inherently irrational, but rather need to consume information in a mind-friendly format that is compatible with the way humans experience things in their lives.

00:55:00
In this section, Steven Pinker discusses the concept of Bayesian reasoning as a powerful tool in science, artificial intelligence, engineering, and more. Bayesian thinking is essential in calibrating one's degree of belief and adjusting it based on available evidence. Pinker emphasizes that Bayesian reasoning is relevant in almost every aspect of everyday reasoning and that it is still not so intuitive for most people. One fundamental problem is that not everyone believes in grounding their beliefs in the best possible evidence, making it almost impossible for them to grasp the concept of Bayesian reasoning.

01:00:00
In this section, Pinker discusses the limitations of Bayesian reasoning in certain aspects of life, particularly in sensitive areas where fairness and morality should be prioritized over predictive power. He notes that relying solely on Bayesian reasoning in certain scenarios, such as courtrooms and college admissions, may not foster fairness and can promote discrimination. However, in journalism and social science, Bayesian reasoning can be useful in understanding the world. The problem, Pinker points out, is that many journalists and even some science journalism are victims of the availability bias, making them innocent of quantitative thinking. This means that they often rely on images, narratives, and anecdotes without providing a base rate, resulting in misunderstandings of situations.

01:05:00
In this section, Steven Pinker discusses the fallacy of reasoning that individuals and even journalists often commit by misestimating important events in life. He suggests that journalists should be mindful of their biases, including a failure of Bayesian reasoning, to play up every revolution, counterintuitive finding, and challenge to dogma and conventional wisdom. Pinker points out that as a result of this, a lot of cool, nifty, counterintuitive, and challenging findings turn out to be bogus or not replicable. This means that people need to consciously employ Bayesian reasoning as a cognitive tool in their minds and in journalism, which inherently involves quantitative trends.

01:10:00
In this section, Steven Pinker discusses how we can become more rational in order to avoid public health disasters and wars that can arise from irrational beliefs. While teaching critical thinking in schools can be effective, it cannot be the only solution. Many students forget what they have learned after they pass an exam, and they don't generalize their knowledge. People must also learn to take the other point of view and avoid the sunk-costs fallacy, but many are not good at making that kind of leap. We must find more effective ways to make people become more rational.

01:15:00
In this section, Steven Pinker addresses the sunk-cost fallacy and how it applies beyond financial decisions, such as staying in a bad relationship or finishing a book that is no longer enjoyable. He argues that critical thinking principles should be integrated into everyday norms instead of just taught in school, so people can apply it to their daily conversations and actions. Despite our susceptibility to fallacies and irrational thinking, Pinker claims that people have made immense progress in avoiding formerly widespread irrational beliefs such as werewolves and astrology. Although irrationality will always exist in large pockets, we can collectively steer towards greater rationality.
