The microbiome is the community of bacteria that lives in the gut, and it is important for health. Viome has developed technology to sequence gut bacteria and has found that there is a microbiome in the brains of healthy people. Dave Asprey recommends intermittent fasting, which allows the gut to refresh and helps to optimize gut and brain bacteria.

The microbiome - the community of bacteria that lives in the gut - is important for health, and there is evidence to suggest that diet and gut bacteria composition play a role in lifespan. Viome has developed technology to sequence gut bacteria and has found that there is a microbiome in the brains of healthy people. One way to increase gut bacteria diversity and health is to eat a plate of vegetables with a moderate to small amount of protein and lots of healthy undamaged fats. While Bulletproof coffee can help increase gut bacteria diversity, fasting is an even better way to improve gut bacteria health.

Dave Asprey recommends intermittent fasting, which involves skipping breakfast and eating what you're going to eat for the rest of the day in a six- or eight-hour window. Doing this allows the gut to refresh and helps to optimize gut and brain bacteria.
