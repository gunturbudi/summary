# Summary of Daniel Kahneman: Why We Make Bad Decisions About Money (And What We Can Do About It)

Daniel Kahneman's video "Why We Make Bad Decisions About Money (And What We Can Do About It)" discusses how humans tend to make sub-optimal decisions when it comes to money. This is due to our cognitive biases which lead us to narrow our perspective and have emotional reactions. To make better decisions, we need to be more numerate and have a broader perspective.

Daniel Kahneman discusses how humans are not fully rational and how they make many choices that, if examined more closely, would be different. He goes on to say that one of the weaknesses of human decision-making is our tendency to narrow our perspective, especially with regards to financial matters. This can lead to poorer decision-making overall because we are not able to account for compound interest or the emotional responses it can produce. In order to make good financial decisions, it is important to be numerate, have a broad perspective, and have limited emotional reactions.
