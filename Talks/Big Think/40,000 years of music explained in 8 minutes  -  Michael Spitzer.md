In a video titled "40,000 years of music explained in 8 minutes," Michael Spitzer discusses the evolution of music, emphasizing that it is fundamentally human and universal. He traces the history of music from hunter-gatherer societies to farming communities and the founding of cities, explaining how music's function and purpose changed over time. With the rise of permanent settlements, heavier and more delicate instruments were invented, and music served as a handmaiden to power, serving the Prince or the Church. Additionally, the introduction of staff notation helped spread Western music and improved control over the Church's music, although it also had some consequences such as freezing music as an object. Spitzer notes that the future of music is limitless with the use of technology, and that the possibilities are unimaginable.

In this section, Michael Spitzer, Professor of Music at the University of Liverpool, discusses the evolution of music through history. He points out that while music is often viewed as an object created by composers for an audience, it is innately human and universal. Starting with hunter-gatherer societies and moving on to farming communities and then the founding of cities, Spitzer explains how the function and purpose of music changed over time. Music originally had to be portable and light, but with the rise of permanent settlements, heavier and more delicate instruments were invented, and music became a handmaiden to power, serving the Prince or the Church. Oftentimes, concerts were only accessible to aristocrats or the upper middle class, and for most people over the course of history, music was performed functionally.

In this section, Michael Spitzer explains how the introduction of staff notation helped in controlling the Church through writing chants down to ensure that singers sang from the same hymn sheet. The introduction of the notation also helped spread Western music as Cortes took it with him, enabling Aztec musicians to sing Spanish polyphony. However, the use of staff notation has some consequences, such as freezing music as an object, making it a tool of mechanical reproduction, and making it somewhat counter-intuitive. Nevertheless, with the use of technology, we can create and enjoy music in our homes, and sharing it gets easier. According to Michael Spitzer, the future of music is limitless, and the possibilities are unimaginable.
