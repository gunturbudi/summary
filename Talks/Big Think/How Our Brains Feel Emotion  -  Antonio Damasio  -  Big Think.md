# Summary of How Our Brains Feel Emotion | Antonio Damasio | Big Think

Antonio Damasio, a neuroscientist, asserts that experiencing emotions is a complex process that involves various actions within the body, either to respond to danger or make the most of opportunities. Though emotions are genetically programmed, they can be influenced by experiences. The feeling of an emotion results from how the organs behave when someone is experiencing it and is represented in different parts of the brain. The insular cortex is critical to this process, but other structures, such as the brain stem and cerebral cortex, are also involved in governing feelings.

In this section, neuroscientist Antonio Damasio explains that feeling an emotion is a complex process that involves a set of orchestrated actions within the body to make life more survivable, either by reacting to danger or taking advantage of opportunities. These emotions are genetically programmed but can be modified by individual experiences. The feeling of an emotion, on the other hand, is a result of representing what is going on in the organs when a person is experiencing an emotion in different structures in the brain, such as the insular cortex, as well as the brain stem and cerebral cortex. Damasio argues that the insular cortex is important, but it is not the only structure that governs feelings.
