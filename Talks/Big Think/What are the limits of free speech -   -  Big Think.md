Experts in this Big Think video emphasize the importance of free speech and its historical role in promoting democracy and individual freedom. They argue that censorship can be ineffective or counterproductive, can violate fundamental values, and can be disproportionately enforced against vulnerable minority groups. The emergency principle allows for exceptions to freedom of speech in cases where speech causes serious, imminent, specific harm and there is no other way to avert the harm. Mary Beth Tinker also argues against the idea that speech that hurts should be restricted, as censorship may ultimately be used against those with the least power and even turned against the censor themselves.

In this section, various experts discuss the limits of free speech. Nadine Strossen argues that censorship is bad because speech is powerful and whoever exercises censorship power tends to do so to perpetuate their own power and silence the voice of their critics. Nicholas Christakis highlights the importance of defending the freedom of expression, even if one disagrees with what is being said. Josh Lieb maintains that legally, individuals should be able to say anything they want, and hate speech laws are anti-democratic. Finally, Floyd Abrams notes that there have always been boundaries on freedom of speech and of the press, but there is a need to expand beyond old interpretations to protect freedom of speech.

In this section, two experts on the First Amendment discuss the limits of free speech in the United States. While there are limitations in national security and libel cases, the First Amendment provides more protection for speech, religion, and the press than any country in history. However, it is important to note that freedom of speech is not absolute and there are exceptions based on the emergency principle. The emergency principle allows the government to restrict speech if it directly causes serious, imminent, specific harm and there is no other way to avert the harm. These exceptions include intentional incitement of imminent violence, targeted bullying or harassment, and genuine threats.

In this section, several experts defend the principles of free speech, even for controversial or unpopular views. Michael Shermer shares an example of how he defended Holocaust denier David Irvine's right to free speech, despite strongly disagreeing with his views. Nadine Strossen and Alice Dreger emphasize the importance of allowing all views to be expressed and having meaningful conversations to promote education and understanding. They caution against censorship, which often ends up being ineffective or even counterproductive. The experts also argue that censorship can lead to thought crimes and violate fundamental values of free speech.

In this section, the speakers discuss the importance of free speech in promoting democracy and individual freedom. They argue that hate speech laws and other forms of censorship are inherently subjective and disproportionately enforced against the very minority groups they are intended to protect. It's important to listen to both sides of an argument, even if you're completely right, as it allows you to strengthen your own position or find out if you're wrong. Shutting down talks or de-platforming speakers violates not only the speaker's right to speak, but also the listener's right to listen. Free speech has been and should continue to be a fundamental value embraced by everyone, regardless of political affiliation.

In this section, Mary Beth Tinker argues against the idea that speech that hurts should be restricted. She points out that her own armband hurt people, but that doesn't mean it should have been banned. She believes that speech is powerful, especially for those who are powerless, and that censorship would ultimately be used against those with the least power, and could eventually be turned against the censor themselves.
