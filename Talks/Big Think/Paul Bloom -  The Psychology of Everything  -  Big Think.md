# Summary of Paul Bloom: The Psychology of Everything | Big Think

In this video, Paul Bloom discusses various topics related to psychology, including compassion, racism, sex, and the hard problem of consciousness. He argues that while our unconscious biases can lead to harmful stereotypes and prejudices, we can mitigate their negative impacts by structuring our world in a way that makes them matter less. Bloom highlights the importance of empathy and personal connections in expanding our moral circle and effecting social change, and he explores the evolutionary biology of sex and the psychology of love and attraction. Overall, he expresses his optimism that scientific psychology can explain the most interesting and intimate aspects of ourselves through constructing scientific hypotheses, neuroscience, computation, and evolution.

In this section, Paul Bloom, a Professor of Psychology at Yale University, introduces psychology as the science of the human mind and its importance in studying the most intimate aspects of our lives. He explains how psychology is divided into different subfields such as neuroscience, social psychology, cognitive psychology, evolutionary psychology, and clinical psychology, each with a different focus area. To illustrate the range of approaches that psychologists use, he chooses three case studies: compassion, racism, and sex. He specifically explores the emergence of compassion in babies and young children, looking at the origins and development of moral emotions like empathy, sympathy, anger, and guilt. Lastly, he introduces the debate surrounding the nature of the computational structure of the brain, whether it starts off as a blank slate or whether it already possesses certain innate abilities.

In this section, psychologist Paul Bloom discusses the debate over whether babies are born with a moral instinct or whether morality is something that is learned. He argues that while learning certainly plays a role in the development of moral thinking, there is evidence to suggest that babies and young children have an inherent sense of compassion and altruism. While this compassion initially only extends to those close to the child, there is evidence to suggest that the default response to strangers is actually a mixture of fear and hatred. Bloom notes that this observation has been made by anthropologists who study small-scale societies, where outsiders are often viewed as a threat.

In this section, Paul Bloom discusses the universal human emotion of disgust and its relationship with feelings towards out-groups, such as immigrants and sexual minorities. He explains that people differ in how easily disgusted they are, and this correlates with their aversion towards these outside groups. Furthermore, research has shown that by inducing feelings of disgust in people, it can make them meaner, particularly towards these out-groups. Despite this, humans have the ability to extend their compassion to strangers, a phenomenon known as the moral circle. Bloom presents a psychological puzzle regarding what forces take our narrow moral circle and expand it to care for others. He suggests that one possible mechanism is related to individual development as people age, allowing for a broader circle of compassion.

able to make generalizations about the world. However, these generalizations can also lead to harmful stereotypes and prejudices, particularly when it comes to race. Paul Bloom discusses the importance of breaking down these categories by emphasizing individual stories and personal connections with people of different races. He notes that empathy and compassion can be extended through the power of stories, and that individuals and societies can expand their moral circles by connecting with individuals rather than just statistics or abstract groups. Bloom cites historical examples, such as the impact of Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin on the abolition of slavery in the United States, to illustrate the power of personal stories and connections in effecting social change.

In this section, psychologist Paul Bloom discusses stereotypes and their problems. Bloom explains that stereotypes are often accurate and positive, but they rely on unbiased information which, if biased, can result in inaccurate or negative stereotypes. Additionally, stereotypes can create a negative impact, as exemplified by Claude Steele's "stereotype threat" concept, where acknowledging one's race or sex can lead to negative stereotypes and worse performance on related tests. Finally, Bloom suggests that any category of human individuals is either an in-group or out-group, and one's connection with the category can impact how they think of it.

In this section, Paul Bloom discusses the tension between our conscious egalitarian system and our unconscious system, which is often data-driven and biased, and responds in a statistical and less morally concerned manner. Although we may consciously endorse egalitarianism, studies reveal the existence of unconscious biases towards certain groups, which can translate into real-world consequences. For instance, studies by Jack Dovidio and his colleagues demonstrate that moderate-qualifications black candidates are less likely to be recommended for a job than white candidates, whilst those by Jennifer Eberhart indicate that the darker one's skin, the more probable a jury is to recommend the death penalty. However, Bloom notes that we can mitigate the negative impacts of unconscious biases by structuring our world in a way that makes them matter less.

In this section, Bloom discusses how symphony orchestras began to hold blind auditions to increase the representation of women in the field. It was discovered that even good people who were not sexist still judged women differently from men, making it difficult for women to succeed. By adjusting the environment and instituting blind auditions, a fair standard was applied, leading to a significant increase in the representation of women. This example shows how psychology can shape policy in a positive way by allowing better selves to make decisions. Bloom also discusses the implications of evolution on sex and the parental investment theory, leading to male competition for access to females which has resulted in the evolution of aggressive traits.

00:35:00
In this section, psychologist Paul Bloom discusses the evolutionary biology of sex, highlighting how the asymmetry of parental investment leads to the evolution of certain traits to attract the attention of females. Females are often scarce and, therefore, males compete with one another to attract them. While there are differences between males and females in terms of sexual interest, there are commonalities, such as an attraction to beauty, particularly features that suggest youth and fertility. These findings have been studied across cultures and have been found to be universally attractive.

In this section, Paul Bloom discusses the psychology of attractiveness and love. He uses babies as a starting point to argue that the preference for attractive faces is part of our hardwiring and evolved system. He then describes how what we think about a person, their age, sex, and kinship, affects how attractive we feel towards them, pointing out how our beliefs influence our response to a person, as demonstrated by Capgras Syndrome. Ultimately, Bloom asserts that love is an exaggeration of difference, and we need to understand this exaggeration to understand the psychology of love and attraction accurately.

In this section, psychologist Paul Bloom discusses three case studies in psychology that are related to compassion, racism, and sex, and how they connect with the six domains of psychology, including neuroscience, development, social psychology, cognitive psychology, evolution, and clinical psychology. He talks about the hard problem of consciousness and how it's challenging for psychologists to understand the experience and phenomenal sense of an individual. However, he expresses his optimism that scientific psychology can explain the most interesting and intimate aspects of ourselves through constructing scientific hypotheses, neuroscience, computation, and evolution. Bloom believes that understanding the mind from a scientific point of view helps to appreciate its complexity and beauty.
