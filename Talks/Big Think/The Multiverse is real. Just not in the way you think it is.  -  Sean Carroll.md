# Summary of The Multiverse is real. Just not in the way you think it is. | Sean Carroll

Theoretical physicist and philosopher Sean Carroll explains the concept of the multiverse and the different conceptions of it, which are the inflationary theory of cosmology and the many worlds theory of quantum mechanics. He argues that the quantum mechanics multiverse creates two parallel realities due to subatomic particles being measured in a quantum mechanical way. While this can serve as a useful psychological tool, we cannot change our past decisions, and by contemplating all the different possibilities and accepting our choices, we can put things in perspective and keep in mind that our causal influence on the world only extends toward the future.

In this section, theoretical physicist and philosopher Sean Carroll explains the concept of the multiverse and how physicists have been dragged towards it, rather than starting out with the idea of it. Multiverse theories in physics were created to explain what is observed in our universe and account for the data we have access to, rather than simply being a cool concept. There are two different conceptions of the multiverse: the inflationary theory of cosmology and the many worlds theory of quantum mechanics. While they both predict the existence of other universes, they do not involve human intervention, and the other universes are literally billions of light years away, having nothing to do with human beings and their daily choices.

In this section, Sean Carroll explains that the quantum mechanics multiverse creates two parallel realities due to subatomic particles being measured in some quantum mechanical way. He argues that if you choose to describe yourself quantum mechanically, there are different versions of you branching the universe like identical twins that share a past but are considered separate people with different possibilities. This can serve as a useful psychological tool, but we cannot change our past decisions. By contemplating all of these different possibilities and accepting our choices, we can put things in perspective and keep in mind that the causal influence we have on the world only extends toward the future.
