# Summary of A.I. Ethics: Should We Grant Them Moral and Legal Personhood? | Glenn Cohen | Big Think

Glenn Cohen discusses the idea of personhood in regards to artificial intelligence and whether AI should be considered a person with moral and legal rights. There are arguments for and against this idea, with some stating that only humans can be considered persons, while others believe that capacity should be the key criterion. Cohen believes we should be open to the idea that AI may eventually become person-like and have the rights of persons, as being open to this idea can help us exercise humility in identifying persons.

In this section, Glenn Cohen discusses the concept of personhood and whether artificial intelligence can be considered a person or not. One argument that people put forward is that only humans can be persons, while another argument says that capacity is the key criterion to be a person, and if a machine has that capacity, it should be considered a person. Cohen explains that it may be possible that some humans are non-persons and some nonhumans are persons. However, we need to be open to the idea that artificial intelligence may at one point become person-like and have the rights of persons. He believes that being open to this idea is not a bad thing and may help us exercise humility in the identification of persons.
