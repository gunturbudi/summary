# Summary of Are Geniuses Born or Made? A Conversation with Dr. Joy Hirsch  | Big Think.

Dr. Joy Hirsch, a neuroscientist, discusses the complexity of the brain and the importance of individual differences when studying genius. She highlights the potential for enhancing natural creativity through education and valuing risk-taking and alternative paths, but also cautions against oversimplifying the brain's complexities. While the extent of interconnectivity between different brain parts can greatly impact a person's individual differences, the underlying biological components and the role of genetics in genius are still largely unknown, and the scientific methodology needs to improve to answer such complex questions.

In this section, neuroscientist Dr. Joy Hirsch discusses the importance of the interconnectivity of different brain parts and how the extent of these connections can greatly impact a person's individual differences. These connections can be more richly innervated, stronger, or simply larger, all of which can contribute to considerable differences between one person's performance and another's. However, when it comes to the question of whether geniuses are born or made, Hirsch points out that the underlying biological components and the role of genetics are still largely unknown. Additionally, she emphasizes that the scientific methodology needs to improve in order to be able to answer such complex questions.
