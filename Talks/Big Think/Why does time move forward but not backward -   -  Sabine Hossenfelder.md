Sabine Hossenfelder discusses the arrow of time in a YouTube video, explaining that it is based on the laws of physics and the behavior of individual particles. She argues that, although entropy will eventually increase and bring about the end of the universe, humans can slow down the process for a period of time.

The arrow of time is the phenomenon in which the future looks different from the past, due to the increase of entropy. This explanation for the direction of time is based on the laws of physics, but it's also based on how individual particles behave. Although entropy will eventually increase and bring about the end of the universe, humans can slow down the process of entropy increase for some amount of time by fending off entropy increase in specific parts of a system.
