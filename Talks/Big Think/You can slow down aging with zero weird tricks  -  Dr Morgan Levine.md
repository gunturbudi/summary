Dr. Morgan Levine explains the concept of biological age, which is the maladaptive change in biology that leads to dysfunction, decline, and ultimately disease, and emphasizes that simple lab measures can help identify the average biological age of a population. She also discusses how the rate at which we age is not just dependent on our genes, and simple lifestyle changes can impact the aging process, improve our resilience, and increase our overall health. Overall, aging can be slowed, and it's not just about having a long life but maintaining optimal health and functioning for as long as possible.

In this section, Dr. Morgan Levine explains the difference between chronological age and biological age and how biological age is a maladaptive change in biology that leads to dysfunction, decline, and ultimately disease. She emphasizes that aging starts at a molecular and cellular level and leads to functional changes and disease manifestations. She describes how biological age is malleable and that aging can be slowed much like some species undergo negligible senescence. Dr. Levine explains that it is important to measure biological age, and phenotypic age is a great way for people to track their biological age.

In this section, Dr. Morgan Levine discusses how to measure our biological age and explains how it is essential to capture the physiological changes that occur before the emergence of disease. By taking simple lab measures, including organ functionality, metabolic health, lipids, inflammation, and immune profile, we can identify the average biological age of a population. The measurement of biological age allows us to pinpoint physiological changes before the onset of disease and understand the factors that affect it. The rate at which we age is not controlled by our genes, and simple lifestyle changes can impact the aging process and increase our resilience and overall health. Therefore, it's not about having a long life, but maintaining optimal health and functioning for as long as possible.
