Dan Cable discusses the "seeking system" in the brain, which pushes individuals to explore and be curious. Disengagement from boring work may not necessarily be a flaw, but rather a feature that comes from the evolution of the seeking system, which was developed to keep us continually learning. The shift towards efficiency and the removal of meaning from work began in the 1850s, leading to the belief that work is just something people tolerate rather than enjoy. Restrictive job roles, where employees are given standard tasks, can lead to boredom and lack of engagement. Cable argues that this is more about company culture and expectations than the industry, and a more open and inclusive culture can lead to employee motivation and contribute to a company's success.
