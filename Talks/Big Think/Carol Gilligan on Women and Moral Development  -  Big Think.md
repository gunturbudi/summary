In this section, Carol Gilligan shares a personal experience where she was discussing womenâ€™s moral development with a group of male philosophers who were promoting an ethic of selfishness. When she asked them why it was considered moral for women to be responsive to others' needs but considered selfish for women to be responsive to their own needs, they were unable to respond. This moment inspired Gilligan to write a paper titled "In a Different Voice" in which she explores the different perspective on morality and ethics that women bring to the table. Her research uncovered that many women felt the same way but had not been able to express their views.
