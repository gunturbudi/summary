# Summary of Superhumans: The remarkable brain waves of high-level meditators | Daniel Goleman | Big Think

Neuroscientist Richard Davidson conducted research on Olympic-level meditators who have done up to 62,000 lifetime hours of meditation. The study revealed that these high-level meditators have gamma brain waves that occur all the time and a 700-800% increase in a few seconds during compassion meditation. This suggests a unique state of consciousness that differs from our ordinary state and may be what is referred to as a state of liberation or enlightenment in classical meditation literature.

In this section, Daniel Goleman discusses research conducted by neuroscientist Richard Davidson on Olympic level meditators, who have done up to 62,000 lifetime hours of meditation. The research found that these high-level meditators have gamma brain waves that show up all the time and jump 700-800% in just a few seconds when doing a meditation on compassion. These findings have never been seen before by science and suggest a special state of consciousness that is not like our ordinary state. This state of being may be what is described in classical meditation literature as a state of liberation or enlightenment.
