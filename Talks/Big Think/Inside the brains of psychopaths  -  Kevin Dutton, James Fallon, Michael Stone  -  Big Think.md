Experts discuss the behavior of psychopaths in social situations and decision-making processes. Psychopaths have the ability to manipulate the emotional hot buttons of others and evoke sympathy while lacking emotional attunement. Psychopaths exhibit little difficulty in making seemingly immoral decisions due to distinct neural signatures in the brain's limbic system. While non-psychopaths' orbital cortex and amygdala work together to regulate animal drives and social behavior, psychopaths have both turned off, resulting in them doing things out of context without being informed socially that their behavior is wrong. Additionally, psychopaths tend to have useful characteristics, such as assertiveness and fearlessness, that can be helpful in situations where indecisiveness is a hindrance. Lastly, genetics and altered brain patterns are important factors in the development of a criminal psychopath.

In this section, the speakers discuss how psychopaths are skilled at manipulating the emotional responses of others, particularly by pushing emotional hot buttons and evoking sympathy. Despite their lack of emotional attunement, they are often charming and persuasive in company. The speakers explore the ways in which psychopaths are adept at making decisions in situations that elicit emotional responses from others, such as ethical dilemmas. While most people struggle with decisions that activate the amygdala or the brain's emotion center, psychopaths exhibit little difficulty in making seemingly immoral decisions. The speakers attribute these differences in behavior to distinct neural signatures in the brain's limbic system.

In this section, experts discuss the importance of the orbital cortex and amygdala in determining moral behavior and decision-making. While these brain regions work together in non-psychopaths to regulate animal drives and social behavior, psychopaths have both turned off, meaning they are doing things out of context and without the social context to inform them that their behavior is wrong. Despite this, psychopaths tend to have useful characteristics like assertiveness and fearlessness, traits that can be helpful in situations where indecisiveness is a hindrance. Interestingly, top athletes tend to have high levels of psychopathic characteristics such as ruthlessness and focus.

In this section, Kevin Dutton explains that genetics and altered brain patterns are important factors in the development of a criminal psychopath. However, he also emphasizes that natural levels of aggression and intelligence play a critical role in determining one's future prospects. If you have these negative traits and are also low in intelligence, you are more likely to engage in violent behavior and end up in prison. On the other hand, if you possess these traits but are not naturally violent and have high levels of intelligence, you are more likely to succeed in fields such as finance.
