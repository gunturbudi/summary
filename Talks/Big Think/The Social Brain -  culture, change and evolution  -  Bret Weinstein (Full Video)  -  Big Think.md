# Summary of The Social Brain: culture, change and evolution | Bret Weinstein (Full Video) | Big Think

Bret Weinstein discusses the relationship between culture and the human genome, highlighting the omega principle that specifies this relationship. He argues that a significant amount of what humans are is not housed in their genomes, but in a cultural layer that is passed on outside of genes. Weinstein also discusses the negative implications of our current economic system that encourages a culture of consumption and waste, leading us to overlook opportunities for long-term, ethical solutions. He stresses the need for a new conversation to tackle the problems of the 21st century and warns against the dangers of Utopianism. Additionally, he talks about the importance of engaging in productive argumentation and engaging with opinions that are different from our own to test the validity of our beliefs and identify areas for improvement.

In this section, Bret Weinstein discusses the relationship between human culture and the human genome. He explains the omega principle, which specifies this relationship, and reveals that a significant amount of what humans are is not housed in their genomes, but in a cultural layer that is passed on outside of genes. He highlights the benefits of understanding this relationship and mentions the hypothesis of cultural evolution coined by Richard Dawkins. According to the theory of memes, there is a process at work in the cultural layer that is very much like the one that shapes human genomes, and culture serves the genetic interests most of the time.

In this section, Bret Weinstein discusses the relationship between culture and genetic interests. He argues that while some cultural structures may seem paradoxical when considered from the perspective of genetic fitness, they have flourished because they have facilitated the interests of the creatures involved. These belief systems are built around evolutionary success and contain human benevolence, appropriate to phases of history when there is abundance and people can afford to be good to each other. However, with the current period of austerity, beliefs and behaviors that were once unreasonable and unacceptable are reemerging, triggered by the signals of the end of the boom times. Weinstein also introduces the concept of being "literally false and metaphorically true" in religious beliefs, where a belief is not factual but behaves as such, resulting in an enhancement of fitness. Finally, he argues that humans are a niche-switching creature, constantly innovating new ways to thrive and grow.

In this section, Bret Weinstein discusses the concept of frontiers and their role in expanding populations and increasing productivity. He explains that there are three kinds of frontiers: geographic, technological, and transfer. However, all frontiers eventually run out, and humans are constantly looking for new sources of growth, leading to a dangerous pattern of becoming more tribal and finding populations that cannot defend their resources. Weinstein warns against the false sense of security that technological breakthroughs will continue to provide growth and explains that humans are wired to capture the benefits of growth and bring them into use, often resulting in greater consumption.

In this section, Bret Weinstein discusses the negative implications of our current economic system. He explains how our society's definition of economic health and growth encourages a culture of consumption and waste, leading us to overlook opportunities for long-term, ethical solutions. Weinstein argues that in a free market, amoral corporations always have an advantage over ethical ones. As a market matures, ethical restraints become a competitive disadvantage, resulting in the evolution of firms towards ruthlessness. This is why even companies with good intentions like Google can become more ruthless over time as markets mature. Ultimately, our current economic system incentivizes unethical behavior and discourages long-term thinking.

In this section, Bret Weinstein argues that a free market is not the ideal state, as it can lead to companies behaving ruthlessly in the pursuit of efficiency. He believes that policymakers need to tinker with society enough that the evolutionary tendency produces the type of firms that we want to see, rather than becoming horrified by their actions. Furthermore, he stresses that the traditional left-right political debate is outdated and that society needs a new conversation to tackle the problems of the 21st century. Finally, Weinstein warns against the dangers of Utopianism, prioritizing a single value at the expense of all others or assuming we know what the future state should look like. Instead, we need to be open to novel solutions as we move into unknown territories.

In this section, Bret Weinstein discusses the importance of understanding the nature of disagreements between individuals, particularly when they are aligned in their values but disagree on how best to achieve them. He emphasizes the need for people to identify the underlying cause of their disagreement, whether it be a difference in values or a strategic disagreement on how to achieve their shared goals. Weinstein highlights the value of engaging in productive argumentation to discover what is true, rather than to simply win an argument. He argues that this approach can lead all sides to increase their understanding and reach a deeper truth, particularly in a time where polarized politics has made it difficult to find common ground.

00:30:00
In this section, Bret Weinstein talks about the problems caused by the silencing of opinions that are at odds with one's own beliefs. He points out that in order to truly understand a topic, one must engage with opinions that are different from their own. Silencing speech has become a common practice among those who believe they know what is best for society, but by doing so, they are missing out on vital information. It is important to engage with those who have different opinions in order to test the validity of our own beliefs and to identify areas for improvement.
