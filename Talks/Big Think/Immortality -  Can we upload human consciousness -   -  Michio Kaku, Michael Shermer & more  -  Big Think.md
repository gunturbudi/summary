The video discusses the possibility of immortality, and how mind uploading and storing cells on silicon may one day allow for it. The scientists interviewed say that there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the topic, and that humans don't even know what consciousness is or where it comes from. They argue that rushing towards such technology is a way of escaping from reality.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Transhumanism is the philosophical school of thought that says that human beings can use technology to transcend their limitations. The craziness here is that we're finding more and more that our technological systems are mirroring some of the most advanced natural systems in nature. What this tells us is that there is no distinction between the born and the made, all of it is nature, all of it is us.

Based on this, transhumanists believe that humanity should use technology to reproduce its consciousness on other substrates, such as silicon chips or even in outer space. Michio Kaku believes that one day we will digitize the entire human brain and shoot it into outer space.

The video discusses the idea of human consciousness being able to be stored on computers and potentially be uploaded into the future. It is a far-fetched concept, and there is no evidence to support it. Even if it is possible, it is likely that humans will eventually die out due to their own actions.
