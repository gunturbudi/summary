# Summary of Eating Hot Dogs Like a Freak, with Stephen Dubner  | Big Think

The video discusses the story of Takeru Kobayashi, a competitive hot dog eater who broke the world record by approaching the challenge differently. Rather than eating each hot dog and bun as fast as possible, he broke the hot dog into two, separated the bun from the hot dog, and soaked the bun in water to make it easier to eat. Dubner encourages individuals to assess the barriers in their own lives, question their legitimacy, and pursue their own goals by thinking like a freak.

In this section, we learn about Takeru Kobayashi, a competitive hot dog eater who broke the world record by eating 50 hot dogs and buns in 12 minutes, which is double the previous record. Rather than approaching the challenge like his competitors who ate each hot dog and bun as fast as they could, taking breaks to drink water, Kobayashi experimented by breaking the hot dog into two, separating the bun from the hot dog, and soaking the bun in water to make it easier to eat. By redefining the problem he was trying to solve, Kobayashi came up with an entirely new set of answers, breaking the limits people thought were possible. The lesson we can draw from his success story has to do with limits and the limits we are willing or unwilling to accept.

In this section, Stephen Dubner, co-author of “Think Like a Freak,” talks about the story of Takeru Kobayashi, a Japanese competitive eater who broke the world record for hot dog eating, and how he approached the artificial barriers that existed before him. Dubner encourages individuals to assess the barriers in their own lives, whether in work or other areas, and to question their legitimacy. If a barrier is not credible, it should be thrown away, and individuals should think like a freak and pursue their own goals.
