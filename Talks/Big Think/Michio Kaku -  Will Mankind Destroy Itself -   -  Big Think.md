# Summary of Michio Kaku: Will Mankind Destroy Itself? | Big Think

Theoretical physicist Michio Kaku discusses the possibility of mankind destroying itself during the transition from a type zero to a type one civilization. A type one civilization has the ability to harness all the planet's energy, manipulate the weather and survive disasters, while a type three civilization could even survive a supernova. Despite the world transitioning to a type one civilization, there are still sectarian and extremist ideas, as well as weapons of mass destruction, that could cause destruction. Kaku suggests that the rarity of type one civilizations in the galaxy may be due to their ability to commit planetary suicide, which may have prevented other intelligent life from reaching this status.

In this section, Michio Kaku discusses the likelihood of mankind destroying itself, with the main danger period being the transition from a type zero to a type one civilization. He explains that a type one civilization has the ability to harness all the energy from the planet, play with the weather, and survive various disasters, while a type three civilization could survive even a supernova. He states that the world is currently transitioning to a type one civilization, but there are still sectarian and fundamentalist ideas, as well as weapons of mass destruction that could destroy life on Earth. Kaku sees two opposing trends, one toward a multicultural, scientific, tolerant society, and the other toward extremism.

In this section, theoretical physicist Michio Kaku muses on the concept of type one civilizations and what may be preventing us from encountering intelligent life in outer space. He suggests that the ability to commit planetary suicide may be exclusive to civilizations that have reached type one status, which makes them rare in the galaxy. The absence of evidence of intelligent life in outer space may be due to the possibility that other civilizations never made it to type one and destroyed themselves in the process.
