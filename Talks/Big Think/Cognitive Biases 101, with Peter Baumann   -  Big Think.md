# Summary of Cognitive Biases 101, with Peter Baumann  | Big Think

Peter Baumann discusses cognitive biases and how they are essential in guiding us through life but can also cloud our clear thinking. One of the most pronounced biases is confirmation bias, which confirms our view of the world but also limits our perspective. Baumann finds the uniqueness bias particularly amusing, as it allows us to think of ourselves as valuable and special. This bias refers to the tendency to perceive ourselves, or those close to us, as more unique and special than others. The level of importance we place on a person in our lives is directly related to how much information we have about them. Becoming aware of biases can broaden our perspective and allow us to approach reality more closely.

In this section, Peter Baumann explains the concept of uniqueness bias, which refers to the tendency of individuals to perceive themselves or people close to them as more unique and special than others. This is because we have far more information about ourselves, our bodies, our history, and capacities, making our lives loom larger in our inner universe. Likewise, people we have relationships with, such as parents, siblings, and friends, are considered more unique than others because we know more about them. Therefore, the level of importance we place on a person in our lives is directly related to how much information we have about them.
