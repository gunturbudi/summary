Researcher Patrick McNamara discusses the significance of nightmares and their link to supernatural agents and religious consciousness. Vulnerable individuals are more prone to dissociative states during the day and nightmares during the night. Nightmares could have enduring effects on individuals, potentially leading to demonic possession of consciousness. McNamara emphasizes the importance of REM sleep in processing and integrating trauma into long-term memory stores and suggests that the fear extinction circuit may function differently during nightmares, which can lead to PTSD.

In this section, the speaker discusses nightmares and their significance regarding supernatural agents and religious consciousness. Nightmares are defined as a scary dream that wakes someone up, and they tend to occur during REM sleep. Many people who suffer from nightmares observe supernatural agents, which is particularly common for individuals with religious backgrounds. Vulnerable individuals are prone to dissociative states during the day and nightmares during the night. Nightmares can have enduring effects on individuals suffering from them, as demonic agents could potentially possess their consciousness. In traditional tribal societies, individuals who could control nightmares and the demonic agents were held in special regard because the nightmares marked them as special human beings. Nightmares reveal the significance of REM neurobiology and its special machinery to handle traumas.
