Psychiatrist and author Bessel van der Kolk explains that trauma is essentially survival and how your brain interprets a life threat and responds through automatic fight-flight or collapse mechanisms. Trauma is not the event that happens to you but how you respond to it, is a subjective experience that can be mitigated by supportive relationships, and is more common than believed. Van der Kolk notes that societies that are trauma savvy can lessen its occurrence by addressing its antecedents through protecting and caring for all members of society.

In this section, psychiatrist and author Bessel van der Kolk explains the difference between trauma and stress.

Trauma changes your brain, particularly the survival part of your brain, which continues to send messages long after the trauma has occurred. Trauma is not the event that happens to you but how you respond to it, and it is a subjective experience that can be mitigated by supportive relationships.

This core issue of hormones and physiological impulses that aid in survival can contribute to physical and mental health problems, which are often longer lasting than other issues. Additionally, poverty, racism, and unemployment can also contribute to higher instances of trauma.
