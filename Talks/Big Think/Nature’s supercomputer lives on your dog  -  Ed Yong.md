Dogs have an incredibly sensitive sense of smell, which they use to interact with their surroundings. This ability is an important part of their natural personality, and depriving them of it can have a negative impact.

Dogs are able to detect a vast array of smells, some that are unique to dogs and others that are common to both humans and dogs. Alexandra Horowitz, a psychologist who specializes in working with dogs, explains that while dogs and humans have similar noses, there are some differences in how the two noses work. One difference is that while in humans the air passes through a sticky layer on the underside of the nose that detects molecules, in dogs this process takes place within a structure on the roof of the dog's nose called the Olfactory Epithelium. This difference in how the nose detects smells allows dogs to sniff for longer periods of time and to be more accurate in their detection.
