Brian Klaas advocates for mandatory psychological testing for individuals seeking high-ranking leadership positions because research shows that those with "dark triad" traits are more common at these levels. Machiavellians are strategic thinkers, narcissists are skilled at gaining people's liking, and psychopaths are impulsive and power-hungry. Psychological testing can reveal whether someone is seeking power for themselves rather than for the greater good, and highlight tendencies towards power-hungry behavior that may disqualify them from leading. Klaas believes that psychological testing is necessary to prevent unfit individuals from being in control of nuclear weapons.

In this section, Brian Klaas discusses the importance of psychological tests for high-ranking leaders such as presidents, CEOs, and other top executives as research shows that those with the so-called "dark triad" traits: Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy are usually at higher ranks. Machiavellians tend to be better at obtaining power as they are strategic thinkers while narcissists are better at making people like them. On the other hand, psychopaths tend to be impulsive and power-hungry. Klaas suggested that psychological screening should be mandatory for high-ranked positions since the consequences of their decisions are affecting real people. Moreover, one of the questions should try to get at the core of why someone is seeking power.

In this section, Brian Klaas argues that psychological testing should be implemented for individuals seeking power at the highest levels. This is important as it can expose those who are in it for themselves rather than for the greater good. Obtaining psychological data can highlight any tendencies towards power-hungry behavior and bring awareness to individuals who may not be fit to lead a company or country. Ultimately, Klaas believes that psychological testing is essential to prevent unfit individuals from being in control of nuclear weapons.
