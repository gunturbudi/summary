He states that having children is a radical act of hope and courage for a better future, as humans have been making short and long-term decisions for as long as humans have existed. Wallach suggests that while there will undoubtedly be difficult times ahead, we should focus on perpetuating our species and moving forward as humans. For parents, the best thing they can do for their children now is to give them the tools to become better humans and great ancestors for future descendants.
