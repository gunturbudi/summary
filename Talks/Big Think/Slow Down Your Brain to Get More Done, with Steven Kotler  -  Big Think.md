# Summary of Slow Down Your Brain to Get More Done, with Steven Kotler | Big Think

Steven Kotler defines flow as an optimal state of consciousness where one performs and feels their best by being absorbed in the task at hand, leading to their sense of self disappearing while their mental and physical performance increases. This state is called transient hypo-frontality, which refers to the shutdown or deactivation of certain parts of the brain, including the pre-frontal cortex responsible for higher cognitive functions, morality, will, and self. The flow state also causes individuals to be plunged into "the deep now" where their perception of time is altered, and they're unable to separate past, present and future.

In this section, Steven Kotler gives a technical definition of flow and how it affects the brain. Flow is an optimal state of consciousness where one feels their best and performs their best when they're absorbed in the task at hand, causing their sense of self and self-consciousness to disappear while their mental and physical performance increases. Transient hypo-frontality is the technical term for this state when certain parts of the brain slow down, shut down or deactivate. The pre-frontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for housing our higher cognitive functions, our sense of morality, will, and self, is one of the significant parts of the brain that shuts down in the flow state. When we're in flow state, we're unable to separate past, present, and future, and we're plunged into researchers' term, "the deep now."
