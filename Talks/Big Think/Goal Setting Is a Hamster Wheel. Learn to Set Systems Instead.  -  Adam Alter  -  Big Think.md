# Summary of Goal Setting Is a Hamster Wheel. Learn to Set Systems Instead. | Adam Alter | Big Think

Adam Alter argues that goal-setting is a broken process because it results in a long-term failure state until you achieve the goal, which does not provide psychological nourishment. Instead, Alter suggests using systems to achieve the same outcome, where the focus is on adhering to a set plan each day, leading to positive feedback and psychological well-being towards an end state. The system approach provides continuous positive feedback, which is more effective than the negative feedback of not achieving a goal.

In this section, Adam Alter refers to goal-setting as a broken process as it means you exist in a failure state for a long time until you achieve the goal, which results in an anticlimactic feeling of not receiving psychological nourishment. Alter argues that a better method to achieve the same outcome is to use systems rather than goals. The idea is that a system is a set plan to achieve a particular outcome, and you are succeeding each day as long as you adhere to your system. The system approach gives you positive feedback as you seek, which is far more effective than the negative feedback of not achieving a goal, leading to psychological well-being towards an end state.
