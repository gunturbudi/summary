In this video, Chris Voss, Dan Shapiro, and others discuss how to win a negotiation. Voss emphasizes that success in negotiation is not about getting to a "yes," but understanding what the path to an agreement is, and mastering no. He explains that interest-based negotiation is just as true in contemporary society as it is in business, and that body language is a major factor in communication. John shares a statistic that shows that body language accounts for 65 percent of communication.

Motivational interviewing is a technique used in negotiations in which two irrational questions are asked in order to get the other side to articulate their own reasons for not complying with a request. This can often lead to them agreeing to do what is requested.

The assertive negotiator understands the other side's position and will often give in in order to be understood.
