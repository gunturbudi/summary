The video discusses the idea that people who are curious, who ask questions, are not just happier, but also live longer. Another important element is engaging with material, which can be text, a work of art, or nature. Relationships are also important, and the number one predictor of happiness is quality time spent with people we care about. Emotional wellbeing is also important, and embracing painful emotions is critical but how to cultivate pleasurable ones is also important.

Knowing this, we can have realistic expectations rather than unrealistic ones about what is possible.
