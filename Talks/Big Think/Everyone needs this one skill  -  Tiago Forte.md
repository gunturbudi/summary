Tiago Forte emphasizes the importance of a personal knowledge management (PKM) class, especially for those who lack access to digital education. While technology is a democratizing force, education is a limitation on that trend, as online services are accessible to everyone but there is no one to orient or educate people on how to use them. The digital divide prevents those who would benefit from this education the most from accessing it. Therefore, a PKM class at the beginning of the semester, perhaps freshman year, could help students learn essential skills such as using software, managing email, setting agendas, goals, organizing notes and files that they can use later in life.

In this section, Tiago Forte discusses how technology is a democratizing force but education is a limitation on that trend. Online services are accessible to everyone, but there is no one to orient or train us on how to use them. The void has inspired the booming industry of YouTubers, bloggers, influencers, and Tik-Tokers who are teaching people how to use software, hardware, and online services. Thus, democratizing the support system that people need to adopt new behavior in their lives. However, the very people who would benefit the most from this education are the least likely to access it due to the digital divide, which is not just about having a computer at home but being immersed in a culture where things like this are even talked about and valued. Therefore, there is a need for a personal knowledge management class at the beginning of the semester, maybe freshman year, to help students learn how to use software, keep email under control, set an agenda for a meeting, set a goal, and organize notes and files for later life.
