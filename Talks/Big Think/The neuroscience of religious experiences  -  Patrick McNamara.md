Patrick McNamara, an experimental neuroscientist, posits that religion disrupts our sense of self in the world and promotes imaginative simulation of other possible worlds. He argues that religious experiences reflect a neurotechnology that updates our sense of self, making self-transformation easier. These decentering processes, which were previously only found in traditional religious practices, can now be implemented in secular contexts to promote self-transformation and well-being. However, McNamara cautions that these practices can lead to fanaticism and violence if not held in a ritual process to ensure safety. He encourages religious believers to rediscover their own traditions and non-religious people to create tools for self-transformation.

In this section, Patrick McNamara, an experimental neuroscientist, challenges the prevailing theory that the function of religion is to modulate anxiety or stave off the fear of death. He argues that religion disrupts current models of the self in relation to the world and promotes imaginative simulation of other possible worlds, calling into question fundamental aspects of our world. McNamara believes religious experiences reflect a neurotechnology that updates our current sense of self, making self-transformation as easy as possible. The process of decentering, composed of the executive sense of self being taken offline, undergoing a liminal experience, a brain search and updating process, and activating a new sense of self, is one of the main accomplishments of religiosity when it's working well.

In this section, Patrick McNamara explains that traditional religious practices involving decentering processes can now be implemented in secular contexts to promote self-transformation and flourishing. However, he cautions that these practices can be dangerous in the wrong hands, leading to fanaticism and violent reactions. The decentering process is a powerful neurotechnology that needs to be held in a ritual process to ensure its effectiveness and safety. McNamara also suggests that religious believers can rediscover the riches of their own tradition, while non-religious people can find or create tools to promote the decentering process and enhance their understanding of human experience.
