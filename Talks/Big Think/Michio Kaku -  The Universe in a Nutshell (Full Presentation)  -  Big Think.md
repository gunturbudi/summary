# Summary of Michio Kaku: The Universe in a Nutshell (Full Presentation) | Big Think

Michio Kaku is a world-renowned physicist who has dedicated his life to understanding the universe. In this video, he discusses the role of physics in shaping the modern world, from the development of technology to the understanding of the universe. He warns that some aspects of science fiction, such as time travel, may take longer than 100 years to come to fruition, while other, more outlandish proposals, such as higher dimensions and portals to other universes, may never be possible.

Professor Michio Kaku discusses the role of physics in shaping the modern world, from the development of technology to the understanding of the universe. He warns that some aspects of science fiction, such as time travel, may take longer than 100 years to come to fruition, while other, more outlandish proposals, such as higher dimensions and portals to other universes, may never be possible.

Isaac Newton discovered the laws of motion and gravitation, which led to the development of calculus. He also invented the reflecting telescope, which allowed for greater understanding of the universe.

00:10:00
This video discusses the mathematics that underlie the motion of objects in the universe, and how these same principles can be used to calculate the movement of objects in space. Sir Isaac Newton developed these equations while working on his famous book, Principia, which was published in 1687. Today, these same laws are still used to control the movement of rockets and other objects.

Michio Kaku explains the principles of electricity and magnetism and their relationship to light. He discusses the work of James Clerk Maxwell, who discovered the speed of light and the existence of waves.

00:20:00
In this presentation, Michio Kaku discusses the consequences of the electromagnetic and nuclear revolutions, explaining how Faraday's and Maxwell's work led to the development of the internet, transistors, and other technologies. He also predicts that the energy of motion will eventually be converted into mass, and that the relationship between energy and mass is expressed by Einstein's famous equation E=mcÂ².

In his presentation, Michio Kaku discusses the origins of the nuclear force and how it has helped to explain the secrets of the sun. He also discusses the dangers of over-exploitation of particle accelerators and the role of antimatter in modern physics.

The universe is made of tiny pieces that come together to create bigger pieces. One piece that is missing is the Higgs-Boson, which scientists expect to find in the Large Hadron Collider. String theory is a theory of everything that is based on the idea that all the forces of the universe, including gravity, electromagnetic force, and the two nuclear forces, can be viewed as music. The Large Hadron Collider is being built to test the theory that string theory is a theory of everything. If the theory is correct, it will also show that there are other universes, and that the Big Bang was caused by the collision of universes or the fissioning of universes.

In this lecture, Michio Kaku discusses the current understanding of the universe, which he says is changing rapidly due to new discoveries in physics. He points out that the universe is mostly made of dark energy, which is much more powerful than any of the known physical forces. However, there is still no definitive answer for what dark matter is, and string theory offers only a partial explanation. Kaku warns that if the current understanding of the universe is wrong, it may be impossible to correct it, and all intelligent life in the universe may ultimately be destroyed.

Michio Kaku discusses the challenges of being a physicist, and advice for young physicists who are interested in theoretical physics. He notes that most physicists fail elementary physics, and recommends focusing on the fundamental principles of physics before trying to make theories look prettier.
