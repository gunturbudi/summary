# Summary of Bruce Bueno de Mesquita: The Five Rules of Power Politics  | Big Think

In a video titled "Bruce Bueno de Mesquita: The Five Rules of Power Politics | Big Think", Bueno de Mesquita discusses the five rules of power politics which include depending on as few people as possible for staying in power, and having a large pool of potential replacements for the small group, taxing people as heavily as possible without causing a revolt, distributing the minimum amount of revenue necessary to keep one's coalition loyal, and keeping the opposition weak and divided to prevent them from threatening one's hold on power. Democracy helps to prevent leaders from deviating too far from what significant numbers of voters want, leading to less variability in policies and more predictable growth rates.

In this section, Bueno de Mesquita discusses the five rules of power politics. The first rule is to depend on as few people as possible to keep one in power, and the second rule is to have a pool of potential replacements for the small group that is as large as possible. The third rule is to tax people as heavily as possible without inciting a revolt, in order to generate revenue to enrich oneself and bribe cronies. The fourth rule is to distribute the minimum amount of revenue necessary to keep one's coalition loyal, focusing on private rewards rather than public goods.

In this section, Bruce Bueno de Mesquita explains the two types of leaders that can emerge when a small coalition is depended on - those who have good ideas to make their country better off, and those who have bad ideas that end up making their citizens worse off. However, he notes that democracy provides a nice feature where the leader cannot deviate too far from what significant numbers of voters want, leading to less variability in policies and more predictable growth rates, even though growth rates may not necessarily be higher. These are the five rules of governance.
