# Summary of 3 great untruths to stop telling kidsâ€”and ourselves | Jonathan Haidt | Big Think

Jonathan Haidt discusses three great untruths commonly told to kids and offers alternative psychological principles that should guide educational practices instead. The first untruth is that what doesn't kill you makes you weaker, but in reality, challenges are necessary for antifragile development. The second is to always trust your feelings, which can lead to limiting beliefs and mental health issues. The third is that life is a battle between good and evil people, leading to tribalism and bigotry. Instead, Haidt advocates for encouraging critical thinking and minimizing anti-fragility, motivated reasoning, and tribalism to prepare kids for a diverse world with offensive content.

In this section, Jonathan Haidt discusses three great untruths that we should stop telling kids and ourselves. The first is that what doesn't kill you makes you weaker, but in reality, people, especially children, are antifragile and need to face challenges to develop social and psychological strength. The second untruth is to always trust your feelings, but this belief leads to people constructing limiting beliefs that can lead to anxiety and depression. Finally, the third untruth is that life is a battle between good people and evil people, and this tribal mindset can lead to racism and bigotry, making it difficult to create inclusive and diverse environments. Instead, we need to encourage critical thinking, question our first interpretations, and emphasize our commonalities rather than our differences.

In this section, Jonathan Haidt highlights three psychological principles that should guide educational practices instead of three great untruths commonly told to kids. These principles are anti-fragility, the tendency towards motivated reasoning, and tribalism accompanied by black and white thinking. Haidt believes that educating kids to demonstrate less of these principles will allow them to become more open-minded and better equipped to navigate a diverse world with offensive content.
