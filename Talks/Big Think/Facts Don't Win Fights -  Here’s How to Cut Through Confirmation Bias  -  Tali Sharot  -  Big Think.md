# Summary of Facts Don't Win Fights: Hereâ€™s How to Cut Through Confirmation Bias | Tali Sharot | Big Think

Tali Sharot explains that people tend to disregard information that contradicts their beliefs due to confirmation bias, where we unconsciously interpret information to fit our pre-existing beliefs. Giving conflicting information can cause polarization, even for smart individuals. However, it's possible to change behavior without changing beliefs by finding common goals. For example, a study convinced parents to vaccinate children by emphasizing the benefits of vaccines instead of trying to disprove the connection between vaccines and autism. Focusing on shared goals over differences can lead to constructive resolutions.

In this section, Tali Sharot explains that people tend to disregard or rationalize information that does not conform to what they already believe, and this is because data does not account for human emotions, desires, motivations or prior beliefs. Giving people information that conflicts with their beliefs can cause polarization, and intelligent people can be more likely to twist data to conform to their pre-existing beliefs. However, it is possible to change people's behavior without going against their beliefs. An example she gives is a study that convinced parents to vaccinate their children by not addressing their fears about autism but by focusing on the benefits of vaccines in protecting children from deadly diseases like the measles.

In this section, the importance of finding common motives in arguments is emphasized. The example of discussing vaccines highlights that when the common goal of protecting children's health was emphasized, rather than getting caught up in a disagreement about the link between vaccines and autism, the outcome was much more positive. By focusing on shared goals, rather than differences, people are more likely to come to a constructive resolution.
