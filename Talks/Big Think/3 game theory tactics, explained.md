Game theory is a mathematical theory used to make sense of how people interact in strategic situations. It has been widely applied and studied in various disciplines, including economics, international relations, and biology. One of the things that game theory has shown is that interactions that are thought of as "zero-sum," or competitive, are not as competitive as they seem. By breaking down an interaction into a bunch of small, manageable parts, negative interactions can be turned into positive interactions.

In game theory, a mathematical theory used to make sense of how people interact in strategic situations, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern formulated the theory. The theory has been widely applied and studied in various disciplines, including economics, international relations, and biology. One of the things that game theory has shown is that interactions that are thought of as "zero-sum," or competitive, are not as competitive as they seem. By breaking down an interaction into a bunch of small, manageable parts, negative interactions can be turned into positive interactions. The most damaging bias in poker and in life is the "sunk cost fallacy," where we are more willing to continue investing time and money in a situation where we know we are losing, instead of quitting and getting our investment back. Awareness of the sunk cost fallacy is the first step to making better decisions.

Game theory provides strategies for minimizing one's losses in zero-sum games, whether the opponent is sophisticated or not. This can be advantageous in situations where the opponent is more sophisticated.
