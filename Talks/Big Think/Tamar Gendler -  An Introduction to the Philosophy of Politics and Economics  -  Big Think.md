# Summary of Tamar Gendler: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Politics and Economics | Big Think

In her lecture on political philosophy, Tamar Gendler introduces three key thinkers in the western tradition - Thomas Hobbes, John Rawls, and Judith Jarvis Thomson - and describes their work in detail. She discusses the concept of the state and the idea that it is created through an agreement between individuals. Gendler also talks about Rawls' theory of justice and how it suggests that societies should distribute wealth in a way that benefits the least well off. Finally, she encourages those interested in pursuing this field of study to do so in order to gain a better understanding of the world around them.

This 1-paragraph summary of Tamar Gendler's lecture on political philosophy discusses the historical origins and key questions asked by philosophers in the western tradition. Gendler introduces three key thinkers in the tradition - Thomas Hobbes, John Rawls, and Judith Jarvis Thomson - and describes their work in detail.

Hobbes argues that in order for humans to live in a state of peace and security, they need a government to protect them from others. He points out that this is a state of life which is undesirable, as it is solitary, poor, and nasty.

The video discusses the concept of the state, which is a rational decision-making tool that allows for cooperation between individuals. The video discusses the idea that the state is created through an agreement between individuals, and that it can only be maintained through the cooperation of the people within it. If either party fails to cooperate, the state can quickly break down. Hobbes' theory of the social contract suggests that in order to maintain a state, individuals must submit to a sovereign figure. 50 years later, John Locke elaborated on this idea in his book "The Second Treatise of Civil Government". Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote a similar work a few decades later, expanding on the idea of the social contract and its importance in the maintenance of a state.

Political philosopher John Rawls attempts to articulate in a social contract tradition a picture of a just society that is stable and just, and which does not sacrifice the rights of individuals.

00:20:00
Rawls argues that in a just society, the benefits and burdens of living together should be distributed fairly, with the emphasis on fundamental rights. He suggests that sometimes the fairest way to make a decision is to put yourself in a position where you have less information.

00:25:00
Rawls' theory of justice suggests that societies should distribute wealth in a way that benefits the least well off. Americans overwhelmingly prefer a society where less than 60% of the wealth is held by the top fifth of the population, and at least some wealth is held by the bottom two-fifths.

00:30:00
Tamar Gendler teaches philosophy at Harvard and is writing a rebuttal to Robert Nozick's Anarchy, State and Utopia. Nozick is concerned that Rawls placed the wrong fundamental notion at the center of his Theory of Justice- the notion of liberty. Nozick argues that in order for a society to be just, it must protect individuals' liberty. This may sound relatively uncontroversial, but what it implies is that any distribution of income, including one in which 1% of the people own 99% of the wealth, can never be illegitimate.

00:35:00
Rawls and Nozick disagree on whether societies should guarantee universal healthcare, whether an inheritance tax is legitimate, and whether the army should be constituted by volunteers or by draft.

00:40:00
Political philosophy and economics is a field of thought that encourages its practitioners to think critically about the ways in which their own desires and interests intersect with those of others. Tamar Gendler discusses the four questions that are typically asked by practitioners of this field, and provides examples of how these questions have been applied to different fields of study. She concludes by encouraging those interested in pursuing this field of study to do so in order to gain a better understanding of the world around them.
