# Summary of Michio Kaku: Is God a Mathematician? | Big Think

In the video "Is God a Mathematician?" Michio Kaku explores the relationship between mathematics and physics, highlighting their intertwined nature and practical use in fields such as celestial mechanics and Einstein's theory of curved surfaces. Kaku suggests that string theory, existing in 10 and 11 dimensional hyperspace, has revolutionized mathematics and may lead to the unification of all forces of nature, allowing us to read the mind of God who may be understood as a mathematician, with cosmic music resonating through 11 dimensional hyperspace as a result of the strings vibrating. Kaku believes the mathematical formulas used to describe the universe are evidence of a mathematical mind behind the universe.

In this section, the relationship between math and physics is discussed, with examples of how math and physics are conjoined for practical questions, such as how to calculate the motion of celestial bodies, and how Einstein's theory of curved surfaces required differential calculus. String theory, which exists in 10 and 11 dimensional hyperspace, with super symmetric dimensions, has revolutionized mathematics, and some believe the goal of physics is to find an equation that will allow us to unify all the forces of nature and read the mind of God. This could lead to the final resolution, that God is a mathematician.

In this section of the video, Michio Kaku posits that the mind of God can be understood as cosmic music that resonates through 11 dimensional hyperspace. He suggests that this cosmic music is the result of the strings that make up the fabric of the universe vibrating, much like the strings on a musical instrument. He argues that the mathematical formulas used to describe this cosmic music and the universe itself are evidence that there is a mathematical mind behind the universe.
