# Summary of Bjarne Stroustrup: Why I Created C++ | Big Think

In the video "Bjarne Stroustrup: Why I Created C++ | Big Think", Bjarne Stroustrup explains that C++ was created as a combination of SIMULA's classes and C's low-level system access, which allows for efficient abstractions for demanding computing tasks, making it useful for infrastructure and stable programming needs. However, the language's main issue is its complexity due to old code still running and the difficulty of cleaning it up without breaking existing programs, which could cost millions or more.

In this section, Bjarne Stroustrup explains how C++ was created as a combination of SIMULA's classes and C's low-level system access. He highlights the strength of C++ in its ability to have efficient abstractions for demanding computing tasks, making it useful for infrastructure and stable programming needs. The language's main issue is the complexity due to old code still running and the difficulty of cleaning it up without breaking existing programs, which could cost millions or more.
