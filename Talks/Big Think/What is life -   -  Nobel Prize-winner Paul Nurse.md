Paul Nurse, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist, explores the fundamental principles underlying life in his talk titled "What is Life?". He highlights the cell as the smallest unit expressing life, and how this ancient mechanism of cell reproduction is shared by all living things. Nurse presents genetics as a core feature of life, emphasizing that hereditary material is present in all living things. Finally, Nurse notes that evolution by natural selection enables living things to better adapt to the environment. He argues that life is all about information, as it permeates every aspect of how living things work.

In this section, Nobel Prize-winning geneticist and cell biologist Paul Nurse discusses his approach to answering the question of what life is, by exploring five great ideas of biology. He starts by examining the cell, the smallest entity that expresses the characteristics of life. Nurse then explains his observation that the ancient process of yeast cell reproduction was controlled by the same mechanism as in humans and how this essentially meant that all living things, including plants, animals, and fungi, were controlled by the same process. He also describes the idea of genetics discovered by Gregor Mendel and his finding that all living things have hereditary material. Finally, Nurse mentions the concept of evolution by natural selection, which gives organisms an advantage in the environment in which they live without a designer.

In this section, Paul Nurse, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist, discusses the core principles underlying life, explaining that life is built on chemistry and information as the cell is a chemical and informational machine that functions through hereditary systems. He notes that living things are bounded physical entities with the ability to evolve through a natural selection that allows them to acquire a purpose to become better adapted. Nurse emphasizes that life is all about information, which permeates every aspect of how living things work.
