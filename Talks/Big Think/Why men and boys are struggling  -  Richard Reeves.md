Richard Reeves, a researcher, highlights the struggles of boys and men in education, employment, and family structures. He argues that many of the issues boys and men face are structural rather than individual and that policy interventions designed for girls and women may not work as well for boys and men. The gender segregation of the workforce, the opioid epidemic, and the declining number of close friendships are contributing to a vicious cycle that makes it harder for other men and boys to succeed. Reeves emphasizes the need for more investment in vocational education and training, encouragement for male teachers, and the creation of job opportunities in different fields like STEM and HEAL. Additionally, he suggests paying more attention to understanding and cultivating meaningful friendships, which he believes are crucial to human well-being. Finally, he examines how the concept of marriage has changed in America since the women's movement in the 1970s.
In this video on "Why Men and Boys Are Struggling," Richard Reeves discusses the changing role of marriage in American society, the gender pay gap, the parenting gap, and the intersectionality of discrimination against Black men. He argues that creating a new model of marriage based on equality and the shared commitment of raising children is necessary in the future. Reeves also suggests redesigning career ladders to be more flexible, encouraging fathers to do more homefront work, and prioritizing the anti-discrimination agenda on Black men, who currently face the biggest discrimination in the labor market. He emphasizes the importance of having conversations based on facts and good faith disagreements and encourages others to join in the efforts to find solutions.

In this section, Richard Reeves explains why he decided to write a book on the struggles of boys and men, despite the potential backlash of it being seen as taking away from efforts to support girls and women. Reeves highlights that, after researching the numbers in education, employment, and the family, he found that many boys and men were struggling in ways worse than he previously thought, with those from lower-income and Black backgrounds being especially affected. Additionally, he argues that many of the problems facing boys and men are structural, rather than individual, with the education system, labor market, and changing family structures being some of the key factors. Reeves also believes that policy interventions designed for girls and women do not necessarily work as well for boys and men and that political polarization has hindered productive discussions on the topic. Nevertheless, he aims to offer concrete policy solutions to rectify these issues.

In this section, Richard Reeves discusses the gender inequality in colleges today and how it has shifted from men being favored to women being favored. Women and girls have overtaken men and boys in education, and this has caught everyone by surprise. Private undergraduate colleges are allowed to discriminate against applicants based on sex, and that carve-out from Title IX now acts as a stealth affirmative-action policy in favor of male applicants. While many colleges are attempting to address this issue, public colleges can't discriminate based on sex, and therefore, the gender gap is more pronounced in those colleges. Furthermore, there is a significant difference in the timing of brain development in adolescence, and the prefrontal cortex of the brain develops earlier in girls than in boys, putting them at an advantage in an education system that rewards those skills.

00:10:00
In this section, neuroscientist Richard Reeves explains how the education system is structured against boys and men due to differences in brain development, specifically in adolescence, when brain plasticity is equal to that in the early years. High school years, in particular, are critical for educational performance and where we see a significant gender gap in brain development between boys and girls, which has consequences through higher education. Boys struggle more with sitting still and paying attention for extended periods of time, which triggers some developmental difficulties that occur more naturally in boys than girls. Reeves concludes that we should be careful not to pathologize these difficulties and medicalize boys' behaviour unnecessarily.

00:15:00
In this section, Richard Reeves discusses the challenges of obtaining data in regards to gender gaps in education. States are not required to report data disaggregated by sex, which prevents clear understanding and consideration of a gender gap in high school graduation rates which currently stands at 82% for boys, in contrast to the 88% graduation rate for girls. Reeves suggests a need for significantly more investment in vocational education and training, an educational area where boys and men seem to perform better on average than their female counterparts. Additionally, Reeves highlights the need for a serious effort to encourage more male teachers, particularly as men are in the minority in teaching positions and at higher risk of child abuse allegations due to current gender biases. Finally, Reeves emphasizes the economic disadvantage that working-class men have faced over the past few decades in contrast to the income increase for some men at the top.

00:20:00
In this section, researcher Richard Reeves discusses the economic struggles that men are facing in today's world. He explains that the economic gaps and inequalities have widened, which are important to understand in the context of gender inequality. Men with less education and fewer skills are not being able to adapt themselves to a world where many traditionally male jobs have reduced over the last few decades. Reeves mentions the need for men to adapt to this new world, which is changing rapidly and not getting much help to adapt. He further emphasizes the need to create more job opportunities in different fields like STEM and HEAL, where women and men can both have equal opportunities.

00:25:00
In this section, Richard Reeves discusses the gender segregation of the workforce in the healthcare and education fields. While significant efforts have been made to get more women into STEM fields, there is a lack of effort to get more men into healthcare and education jobs, which are becoming increasingly female-dominated. Men who do want to enter these fields often face a stigma, which is similar to the stigma women faced when entering very male jobs before. Additionally, men have faced a "one-two punch" from globalization and automation, which has reduced traditionally male jobs while increasing the need for relational and soft skills. Finally, the shift in the shape of families has created a dad deficit, where fathers are being held to an old standard of what it means to be a successful father, and many men are being benched by societies and families as a result.

00:30:00
In this section, Richard Reeves discusses the impact of the changing roles of women in society on fatherhood and masculinity. With women increasingly able to provide economically for themselves, they no longer need to rely on men for financial support. However, this has led to a challenge in understanding the role of fathers in modern families and in the lives of their children. The narrowing of the traditional definition of masculinity leaves many men feeling dislocated and disoriented in a rapidly changing world. The lack of a clear definition of what it means to be a good father has left many men feeling benched, while also contributing to the troubling health consequences of the so-called "deaths of despair."

00:35:00
In this section, Richard Reeves discusses the problem of the opioid epidemic and how it is linked to the broader male malaise in society. He argues that the loss of a role in the family and status in the labor market, combined with isolation and withdrawal, is a perfect illustration of why men and boys are struggling. Reeves emphasizes that there is nothing inherently wrong with men and boys, but they are just facing new challenges and need help adjusting to this new world. The lack of male teachers to help boys in education, the scarcity of men in the growing fields of occupation, and fathers being left on the sidelines of their children's lives are contributing to a vicious cycle that makes it harder for other men and boys to succeed. Another issue, which is also more prevalent for men than women, is the friendship recession and the declining number of people who have close friends that they can turn to in times of crisis. Reeves suggests paying more attention to understanding and cultivating meaningful friendships, which the ancient philosophers saw as the ideal relationship.

00:40:00
In this section, Richard Reeves discusses the importance of friendship and factors that are getting in the way of people having more friends. While friendship is a pure human relationship that survives only as an equal friendship, it is difficult to measure qualitatively and quantitatively. The rise of mobility, the adoption of technology, and parents spending more time raising their kids has led to a decline in actual face-to-face friendships. However, technology plays a double-edged role in sustaining friendships. While it can impede developing real friendships, it is clear that online friendships can augment, and in some cases, lead to and sustain those other kinds of friendships too. Interestingly, during the pandemic, women who typically have more friends than men suffered the most in terms of losing touch with them.

00:45:00
In this section, Richard Reeves explains why it becomes harder to make friends as we get older. He suggests that people fill their time with other activities, including work, but he also believes there is a deeper issue at work - vulnerability. Making a true friend requires one to admit the desire for friendship, revealing a need and desire that is not always easy to admit as we age. Unfortunately, research suggests that the lack of friends can have a profoundly negative impact on health, both physical and mental, indicating that making and sustaining friendships is crucial to human well-being. Reeves suggests that as we live longer, recognizing the importance of friendship becomes even more critical, making the decline in social networks an issue that we need to take seriously.

00:50:00
In this section, Richard Reeves discusses the importance of diversity in friendships and the intentional effort required to sustain them. He emphasizes that friends should expose us to different perspectives, challenge us, and contribute to a vibrant diversity in our lives, which can prevent us from living in a bubble surrounded by people just like us. He also notes that the death of marriage has been misconstrued and that there are diverse reasons why people get married, including religion, love, economics, and status. The trends in marriage are complex and vary across different educational groups. Despite the decline in marriage rates, divorce rates have stabilized.

00:55:00
In this section, Richard Reeves discusses how the concept of marriage has changed in America since the women's movement in the 1970s. Marriage used to be seen as a necessity, particularly for women, who needed financial support from a man to raise children. However, the women's movement pushed for women to have more freedom and economic independence, leading to a decline in the popularity of traditional marriage. Nevertheless, many college-educated American women are choosing to get married, but in an egalitarian and flexible way that is very different from the past. Marriage has been fundamentally transformed in ways that are not always visible from the outside but are clear on the inside.

01:00:00
In this section of the video, Richard Reeves talks about the class fracture in American society around marriage and how the patterns for marriage rates and childbearing vary by social class. Marriage has become more of a signifier of social status, and we can't tell a single story about marriage in America anymore. There has been a significant shift up in the age of first marriage, and instead of being about economic dependency, it's more like a joint venture for raising kids. Marriage is a way of signaling a strong commitment to invest heavily in their children's future using time and money, making it more about parenting than love.

01:05:00
In this section, Richard Reeves discusses the changing sentiment towards marriage in America and how it is no longer viewed as an essential component to lead a fulfilling life. While some hold nostalgia for the 1950s, with their traditional family roles and stability, the downside was that half the population was economically dependent on the other half which was deeply unfair. Reeves believes that the challenge of the future is creating a new model of marriage based on equality and the shared commitment of raising children. He also talks about Hans Rosling's idea of the gap instinct, which means that people imagine two groups are completely separate when they hear about an average gap, like the gender pay gap.

01:10:00
In this section, Richard Reeves discusses the gender pay gap. Although progress has been made towards closing the gap, he explains that women are still disproportionately affected by the economic consequences of having children. Women are more likely to take time off work and reduce their hours for childcare, which can negatively impact their earnings. Furthermore, this tends to happen during critical years for career growth which can amplify these effects. Although discrimination used to be a large part of the gender pay gap, the current gap is driven mostly by the different types of work men and women do, as well as the time women take out of work to raise children.

01:15:00
In this section, Richard Reeves explains the parenting gap and how it contributes to the gender pay gap. The impact of taking time away from the labor market or working part-time has a long-term negative effect on career progression, which has a double hit on women. To address this issue, Reeves suggests redesigning career ladders to be more compatible with flexibility and encouraging fathers to do more homefront work. Reeves also highlights the importance of intersectionality and the role it plays in the labor market, using the example of the gender and race pay gap. White women earn significantly more than Black men, and Black men earn only slightly more than Black women, revealing the complexity of demographic groupings.

01:20:00
In this section, Richard Reeves discusses the intersectionality of different dimensions of discrimination and how Black men are facing the biggest discrimination in the labor market today. Thus, an anti-discrimination agenda must be approached intersectionally, where certain men often suffer the most, currently being Black men in society. Reeves suggests that for helping certain groups, Black men should be a priority. Additionally, Reeves mentions that he would give more emphasis to the role of friendship as it is becoming an increasing challenge, especially for men today, given their issues in family life and employment. Reeves also believes that the social reasons for getting more men into caring professions are much stronger than the economic argument he previously led. Finally, Reeves explains that his role in writing this book is to provide a less febrile discussion around this issue and create a safe space for conversations based on facts and good faith disagreements without another polemic.

01:25:00
In this section, Richard Reeves speaks about his hopes of breaking the stalemate around the issues that men and boys are facing in today's society. He acknowledges that he is only playing a small part but believes that there is value in starting the conversation and working towards solutions.
