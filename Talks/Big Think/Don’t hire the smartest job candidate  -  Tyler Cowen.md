He argues that finding undervalued talents is key to good hiring and biases may exist in the gender of a candidate.

In this section, Tyler Cowen talks about neurodiversity in the workplace, particularly for individuals who may be considered "different" due to a condition such as ADHD or autism. He notes that such individuals may not interview well or have done poorly in school due to a poorly designed education system incapable of dealing with neurodiversity. Cowen cautions against dismissing these individuals based on interview performance or grades, as some of the greatest talents are highly unusual and undervalued. He points to the venture capital sector as excelling at finding talent due to a fear of missing out mentality, encouraging open-mindedness, and risk-taking.
