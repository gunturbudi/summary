In a YouTube video titled "The psychology of keeping secrets inside," Michael Slepian discusses the negative impact of common secrets such as lies, romantic desire, and financial issues on our emotional and mental health, leading to feelings of shame, isolation, and inauthenticity. Keeping secrets can exacerbate loneliness, which is equivalent to smoking in terms of its impact on our health. However, Slepian emphasizes the benefits of sharing secrets, including mutual disclosure as a predictor of relationship strength and the possibility for validation, sympathy, guidance, advice, or emotional support from others. Talking about secrets can deepen relationships and offer the necessary help that one cannot provide to themselves.

In this section, Michael Slepian discusses the impact of secrets on our health and wellbeing. While some secrets, like surprise parties or pregnancy announcements, can bring joy, the most common secrets - including lies, romantic desire, finances, sexual behavior, and extrarelational thoughts - are often burdensome and harmful to our emotional and mental health. People who keep secrets often feel ashamed, isolated, and inauthentic, leading to negative thinking patterns and rumination. This can exacerbate loneliness, which is equivalent to smoking in terms of the impact it has on our health. Slepian emphasizes that sharing a secret can be a profound act of intimacy, and that we don't have to choose to be alone with our secrets.

In this section, Michael Slepian discusses how revealing a secret to someone can lead to benefits beyond just feeling good after the moment of catharsis. Mutual disclosure is a strong predictor of relationship strength, and confiding in someone can lead to them offering validation, sympathy, guidance, advice, or emotional supportâ€”things that are hard to find on our own but can be easily offered by others. Keeping a secret means forgoing all these benefits, and talking about it with someone else can deepen relationships and provide the help needed.
