Jonathan Haidt discusses how today's generation, Gen Z, has been raised with moral dependency, making them more easily damaged, weak and discouraged when faced with conflicts. To prepare them for the world, Haidt suggests teaching them psychological principles and critical thinking skills, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to question their feelings and analyze evidence. He suggests that high school and college students should learn these skills to combat the high rates of depression and anxiety that exist today. Haidt also emphasizes the importance of drawing larger circles around group interests through identity politics, but warns against "common enemy identity politics," which hinders inclusivity and diversity.

In this section, Jonathan Haidt discusses the changes in today's generation, Gen Z, that cause them to have more difficulty in working out their problems on their own. Gen Z has been raised with moral dependency, where they have always had an adult there to help them. Haidt argues that when we protect children from unpleasantness, teasing, exclusion, and conflicts, we are making them more easily damaged, weak, and easily discouraged. We should teach them to live in a world with offensive content but make sure that physical safety is the priority. To prepare the younger generation to deal with the world, they need to understand psychological principles and practice critical thinking, which requires them to question their feelings and consider other perspectives.
