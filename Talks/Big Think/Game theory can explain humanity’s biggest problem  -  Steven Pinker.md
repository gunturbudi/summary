Steven Pinker discusses how game theory can be used to understand the "Tragedy of the Commons" and applies it to the realm of rationality. He believes that individuals may prioritize their own beliefs and group identity over objective truth, which can have negative consequences for society as a whole. However, despite challenges posed by factors like populist nationalism and identity politics, Pinker believes that civilization is moving towards greater rationality and humanistic values. He encourages the endorsement and advancement of these values, which have a built-in advantage when appealing to our shared humanity.

In this section, Steven Pinker introduces the concept of "game theory" as a way to understand the "Tragedy of the Commons," in which rational choices for individuals lead to negative consequences for everyone. He argues that this concept applies to the realm of rationality itself, where individuals may prioritize their own beliefs and group identity over objective truth. Despite the challenges posed by populist nationalism, religious fundamentalism, and identity politics, Pinker believes that civilization is slowly moving in the direction of greater rationality and humanistic values. These values have a built-in advantage when appealing to our shared humanity, and Pinker encourages us to endorse and advance them.
