# Summary of Jae Rhim Lee: My mushroom burial suit

Jae Rhim Lee presents the Infinity Burial Project, a concept that uses mushrooms as a means of decomposing and cleaning toxins from bodies for a more ecological mode of burial. She discusses the toxicity of our bodies and current harmful burial practices and proposes using selectively bred Infinity Mushrooms to consume the deceased's toxins. Lee introduces decompiculture, a movement for cultivating decomposing organisms to aid in promoting ecological health. She plans on integrating Infinity Mushrooms into objects such as her biodegradable mushroom burial suit to facilitate decomposition and toxin remediation. Lee formed the Decompiculture Society, a group called decompinauts, to explore postmortem options and cultivate decomposing organisms.

In this section, Jae Rhim Lee discusses the toxicity of our bodies and how our burial practices add to the cycle of toxicity. Traditional funeral practices with embalming fluids and cremation release toxins into the environment, harming both the living and the planet. Lee proposes the Infinity Burial Project, using mushrooms to decompose and clean toxins in bodies, specifically with the Infinity Mushroom, a kind of selectively bred fungus that can consume toxins from the deceasedâ€™s body. This concept is part of a larger movement called decompiculture that involves cultivating decomposing organisms to break down dead bodies and contribute to ecological health. Finally, Lee mentions that in the future, she plans to integrate Infinity Mushrooms into objects like her burial suit, made from a biodegradable material infused with mushroom spores.

In this section of the video, Jae Rhim Lee explains her mushroom burial suit and decompiculture kit, which help speed up decomposition and toxin remediation by using mushroom spores. Lee plans to test these on expired meat and then human subjects who have offered to donate their bodies to the project for the benefit of the environment. She believes that accepting death and decomposition is vital for understanding our connection to the environment and taking true environmental responsibility. Lee has formed the Decompiculture Society, a group of people called decompinauts, to explore postmortem options and cultivate decomposing organisms.
