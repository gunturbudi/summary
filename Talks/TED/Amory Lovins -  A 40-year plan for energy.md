# Summary of Amory Lovins: A 40-year plan for energy

Amory Lovins proposes a 40-year plan to transform the energy industry by reinventing fire and eliminating the addiction to traditional fuels. He suggests the use of ultralight, ultrastrong materials in cars, efficient fuels, innovative pricing and smart IT to enhance transit and car sharing. Lovins emphasizes the importance of energy efficiency and industrial design for savings, the viability of renewable energy combined with efficiency and gas to replace coal-fired power plants, and the use of decentralized micro-grids for national security and economic growth. He also discusses RMI's initiatives to help companies transition to renewables and invites everyone to participate in the conversation to make the world richer, fairer, cooler, and safer.

In this section, Amory Lovins proposes a way to change the traditional energy conversation, asking the question “what if we could make energy do our work without working our undoing?” He proposes the idea of creating a new fire, one that will make us safe, secure, healthy and durable, reinventing fire to use resources effectively and generate energy with lower costs. He suggests that it is possible to eliminate the addiction to oil and coal by 2050, and transition to a more efficient, connected, and distributed energy system that doesn’t depend on traditional fuels. This energy system could cost $5 trillion less in net present value by 2050 than business as usual, supporting a 158 percent larger U.S. economy, all without the need for Congress to act.

In this section, Amory Lovins discusses how the use of ultralight, ultrastrong materials like carbon fiber composites can make dramatic weight savings in cars and make them simpler, cheaper, and more efficient to build. He explains that lighter and more slippery autos need less force to move them, so their engines get smaller, which then makes electric propulsion affordable as batteries or fuel cells also get cheaper and lighter. Together, these innovations can transform automakers from wringing tiny savings to steeply falling costs that will eventually move us away from the use of oil as energy. Lovins discusses how America could become the leader in this next automotive revolution, similar to the shift from typewriters to computers and how manufacturing techniques can scale to automotive speed, save four-fifths of the capital needed to make autos, and save lives by absorbing up to 12 times as much crash energy per pound as steel.

In this section, Amory Lovins discusses a 40-year plan for energy, highlighting the need for innovative pricing and the use of smart IT in order to enhance transit and enable car sharing and ride sharing. Lovins suggests that by implementing these strategies, the US could become more mobile without using any oil. Lovins also notes the importance of transitioning to efficient, but sustainable fuels, such as hydrogen or advanced biofuels, and explains how institutional acupuncture can be used to speed up the transition. Additionally, Lovins addresses the importance of saving electricity by improving energy productivity in buildings and industry, which can be achieved through integrative design and could result in significant net savings.

In this section, Amory Lovins discusses the importance of industrial design and energy efficiency for savings. By integrating 35 improvements, the efficiency of motors that are responsible for half of the world's electricity can be doubled and costs can be paid back in a year. Redesigning pump systems can also lead to energy savings of up to 86% and shrunken capital costs. Such savings of electricity can ease the shift to renewable energy sources, which have seen explosive growth and plummeting costs, surpassing the total installed capacity of nuclear power. Lovins presents renewable energy, combined with efficiency and gas as a viable solution for replacing coal-fired power plants at a cost less than their replacement cost, thus eliminating the need for investment in new nuclear or coal-fired power plants.

In this section, Amory Lovins discusses how renewable energy grids can be just as reliable as traditional grids when they are diversified by location and type and are integrated and forecasted. The risks associated with renewable and non-renewable energy sources and grid systems are compared, and it is argued that decentralized micro-grids are the best system for maximizing national security, innovation, and entrepreneurial opportunity. Lovins argues that, with the right policies, America can transition to a completely renewable energy grid without raising costs, resulting in energy savings, economic growth, improved national security, and a reduction in carbon emissions. By focusing on outcomes, Lovins believes America can overcome its energy challenges and become a leader in combating global challenges.

In this section, Amory Lovins discusses how his team at RMI helps companies get unstuck and speed up their journey towards transitioning to renewable energy via six sectoral initiatives. He also talks about the profound transition in the history of our species as we invent a "new fire" that is bountiful, everywhere, permanent, and free. Lovins emphasizes that this is not just a business opportunity but a solution to issues such as climate change, energy poverty, and insecurity which make us less safe. He invites everyone to engage in the conversation and help make the world richer, fairer, cooler, and safer by reinventing fire.
