In this section, the speaker emphasizes the importance of radically rethinking communication and writing in a digital world where people skim and don't pay attention to most of what is written. The speaker, a journalist by training and founder of media companies like Axios and Politico, explains how data taught him that almost nobody goes beyond the first page, even if the content is over 1,600 words long. He realized that everyone is getting hit with more information than ever before, leading to perpetual distractions while skimming contents without really reading them. Understanding what the data is telling us and re-evaluating the way we communicate is the need of the hour, as people's attention span continues to decline due to the internet.

In this section, Jim VandeHei shares tips on how to become a more effective communicator by writing less but saying more. He urges writers to be less self-indulgent and think more about what their audience wants to know. One should grab the reader's attention by focusing on the most important message, keeping it simple and straightforward, and using strong, simple words. VandeHei recommends avoiding fancy words that are not relatable to the reader and just stopping once the intended message is delivered, as using fewer words and sentences will save time for everyone.

In this section, the speaker concludes his talk by emphasizing the importance of mastering the art of brevity to make our points clear, powerful, and memorable. He emphasizes that we live in an attention economy in which people are overwhelmed with information, and, therefore, we must learn how to write and speak in ways that cut through the noise and leave an impact. He reminds us that brevity is not about being lazy or dumbing down our messages but rather about respecting our audience's time and attention by getting to the point and avoiding unnecessary fluff. Finally, he encourages everyone to practice being concise in all aspects of their lives, from emails and social media posts to speeches and meetings, as it is a skill that will continue to be highly valued and rewarded in a world where attention is the scarcest resource.
