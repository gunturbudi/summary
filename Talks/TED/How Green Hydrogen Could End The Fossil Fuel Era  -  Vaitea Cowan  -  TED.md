Vaitea Cowan discusses the potential of green hydrogen as a potential replacement for fossil fuels, noting that it has three times the energy density of diesel, is mass-produced and standardized, and is currently being developed as a product. She believes that by focusing on a single core size, Enapter can leverage massive economies of scale and drive down the price of green hydrogen.
