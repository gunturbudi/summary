# Summary of Susan Savage-Rumbaugh: The gentle genius of bonobos

In this video, Susan Savage-Rumbaugh discusses the unique and empathetic society of the Bonobo, despite their controversial sexual behavior. She introduces Kanzi, a Bonobo who has learned to make stone tools and use fire, and showcases the similarities between Bonobos and early humans. The video highlights the importance of creating a bi-species environment where Bonobos can learn and develop unexpected potential. Through this interaction and cultural exchange, both Bonobos and humans learn to become like each other, promoting better communication and understanding between species.

In this section, speaker Susan Savage-Rumbaugh talks about the Bonobo and their unique characteristics. She states that Bonobos are the happiest species on the planet and their empathetic and egalitarian society should be studied and learned from. Despite their sexual behavior, which is too human-like for most to be comfortable with, their use of sexual behavior for communication and conflict resolution should be appreciated. She also challenges the notion that the animal world is hard-wired and attributes human culture to our biology. The speaker introduces Kanzi, a Bonobo in a forest in Georgia, and showcases the similarities between the Bonobo and early australopithecine walking. Finally, she talks about the wild Bonobo's characteristics, such as being gentle, slim-bodied, and able to walk upright for long distances.

In this section of the video, Susan Savage-Rumbaugh talks about her research center where eight Bonobos live as a family. She shares a video where Kanzi, one of the Bonobos, is learning about fire, its uses, and how to keep it going by observing the humans. She also talks about how the Bonobos speak with each other long-distance and one of them tries to drive a golf cart. The video also shows Panbanisha grooming Nyota, her offspring, using scissors instead of hands like in the wild. Bonobos in the research center have been raised in a culture that is both Bonobo and human, and documenting their development for over two decades is helping scientists better understand how cultural forces may have operated during human evolution. Kanzi has even learned to make stone tools by holding the rocks in both hands and striking one against the other to make larger, sharper flakes.

In this section, we learn about Kanzi's remarkable ability to make stone tools with great skill, using rocks that are nearly identical to those used by our African ancestors over two million years ago. We also see Panbanisha communicating with Dr. Sue by writing lexigrams on the floor and learn that the key to teaching bonobos language is simply using language around them. The video highlights the importance of creating an environment in which bonobos can have fun and view others as meaningful individuals, allowing unexpected potential to emerge.

In this section, we see researcher Dr. Sue singing a song as Kanzi, a bonobo, plays the xylophone alongside her. Kanzi and his sister Panbanisha are immersed in a culture that promotes the emergence of new capabilities, as seen in their ability to use symbols and language. This bi-species environment, known as a "panhomoculture," teaches humans how to communicate with other species and share tools, technology, and language regardless of biological differences. Through this interaction and cultural exchange, both Bonobos and humans learn to become like each other.
