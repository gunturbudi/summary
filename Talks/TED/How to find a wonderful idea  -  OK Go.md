# Summary of How to find a wonderful idea | OK Go

In this video, Damian Kulash from OK Go explains their creative process and how they come up with the elaborate ideas for their music videos. He describes it as an organic process where ideas come from playing in a sandbox of untried ideas, maximizing the chances of success by increasing the reliability of each component. For their video "The One Moment," they used ballistics and math to create a 4.2 seconds real-time shot, perfectly synchronized with the song, emphasizing the importance of making every moment count. The band urges people to build and create, knowing that everything may ultimately be destroyed, but cherishing the moment anyway.

In this section, Damian Kulash of the band OK Go talks about how their music videos have become known as much for their creativity as their music. Kulash addresses the question they get asked all the time, which is how they come up with the elaborate ideas for their videos. He says that they have trouble answering the question because it doesn't feel like they think of the ideas at all, implying that the ideas come from a more organic process.

In this section, Damian Kulash shares his perspective games which he play with his eyes to make sense of visual overload. He describes that having an idea feels like having completely disparate parts, and only being in the right place and receptive enough to get them to just line up. However, there is a bias against surprising ideas, which makes the process of creating things much more expensive in terms of time and resources. Despite that, there are ways to maximize the chances of success, and that is by increasing the reliability of each component, so that in complex systems, there is less likelihood of failure.

In this section, the lead singer of OK Go explains that ambitious projects with a lot of moving parts will inevitably have to use ideas that have already proved to be 100% reliable. However, there are tons of untried ideas out there, and the key is to identify a sandbox where they're plentiful and gamble resources on getting in and playing until you find something that lines up in a surprising way. OK Go used sandboxes like optical illusions and dancing on moving surfaces in their music videos, and in the case of "The One Moment," ballistics and math. The video shows a 4.2 seconds real-time shot, slowed down and synchronized perfectly with the song, making this one moment, the one that mattered, and the reason to have been here.
