In this section, Michael Anti, a Chinese journalist, discusses the complexity of China and the challenges of telling a one-sided story. He notes that China is a BRIC country, meaning it is an important emerging economy helping to revive the world economy, but it is also a SICK country (Syria, Iran, China, North Korea) without access to Facebook. He then compares China's famous great wall to the Great Firewall, which is the biggest digital boundary in the world and is meant to prevent China's citizens from accessing the global internet and to keep them separate and not united. However, this has not stopped the booming Chinese internet society, which has found ways to circumvent censorship through "smart censorship," which involves blocking and cloning international web services.

In this section, Michael Anti discusses how Chinese social media platforms have become a public sphere and created a nightmare for Chinese officials, despite censorship attempts. With 300 million microbloggers in China, social media has become a pathway for public opinion. In 2011, when two trains crashed in Wenzhou and authorities tried to cover it up and bury the information, 10 million criticisms of the posting on social media happened within the first five days, leading to the sacking and 10-year jail sentence of the rail minister. Chinese social media, even when censored, is so booming because Twitter clones in China do not have the 140-character limitations and are regarded by the Chinese as a media platform itself. Anything not mentioned in Weibo, it does not appear to exist for the Chinese public.

In this section, Michael Anti discusses how social media, specifically Weibo, has given a voice to the voiceless in China and allowed for a public sphere to emerge in a country where the government tries to control the narrative. Weibo has become a platform where people can share their stories and even petitions, and if the stories are picked up by reporters or celebrities, they can become national news. However, despite the freedom Weibo provides, there is still heavy censorship, and the government uses data mining to crack down on dissidents. Yet Anti points out that even local governments have limited power as they cannot access the data in Beijing without bribing central officials, which has made local governments more transparent in recent years.

In this section, journalist Michael Anti explains how the Chinese government utilized the freedom of speech granted during Weiweiâ€™s five-day detention to purge him. He notes that while censorship is normal in China, the country's public sphere, Weibo, became a marketplace of rumors, and the freedom was a targeted and precise window. Anti also explains the power the centralized server structure gives the Chinese central government to counter local government and different factions. While social media in China has changed the Chinese mindset to embrace freedom of speech, Anti warns of the danger of the government utilizing centralized server structures as a way of maintaining power.
