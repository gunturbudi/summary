# Summary of Can we edit memories? | Amy Milton

The video discusses research into memory editing, which suggests that it may be possible to delete information from memories. This research could potentially be used to treat mental health disorders, such as PTSD, by selectively targeting the emotional memories that underlie the disorder.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Memory is an everyday thing that we take for granted.
There are two types of memory-declarative and non-declarative.
 declarative memory includes memories for facts and events, while non-declarative memory includes emotional memories such as how we react to cues.
PTSD is a mental health condition characterized by symptoms such as fear and anxiety, flashbacks, and uncontrolled behavior.
One type of non-declarative memory is emotional memory, which refers to our ability to learn about cues in our environment and their emotional and motivational significance.

Memory retrieval is like opening a file in edit mode; under the right conditions, we can delete the information from a memory. This reconsolidation view of memory allows us to account for some of the quirks of memory, like how we all sometimes misremember the past. It also gives us a way to destroy those maladaptive fear memories that underlie PTSD.

The video discusses research into the ability to edit memories, with particular focus on Propranolol. The study found that Propranolol can only have an effect on a memory if it is in "edit mode," which suggests that it might be possible to treat PTSD with memory-destroying treatments that selectively target non-declarative emotional memories. However, the study notes that more research is needed before these treatments can be considered for widespread use.

The video discusses research into memory editing, which suggests that it is possible to significantly reduce the frequency of flashbacks associated with traumatic memories. This could potentially be used to treat mental health disorders, such as PTSD.
