# Summary of How sleep affects what -- and how much -- you eat | Sleeping with Science

The video explains how a lack of sleep can result in unnecessary weight gain, as a decrease in levels of appetite-regulating hormone, leptin, can make us feel less satisfied during meals, while an increase in levels of the hormone ghrelin can make us constantly hungry and wanting to eat more. Moreover, a lack of sleep can shift our food preferences towards higher-calorie and sugary carbohydrate foods, yet, eating in excess and a diet with high amounts of sugar and low amounts of fiber can lead to worse sleep quality and quantity. Therefore, sleep can be utilized as a tool to control body weight and improve overall health and wellbeing.

In this section, the video discusses how a lack of sleep can lead to unnecessary weight gain due to an imbalance in the appetite-regulating hormones called leptin and ghrelin. When we don't get enough sleep, levels of leptin decrease, making us feel less satisfied by our meals, while levels of ghrelin increase, making us feel constantly hungry and wanting to eat more. Additionally, a lack of sleep can shift our food preferences towards higher-calorie and sugary carbohydrate foods. On the other hand, eating in excess and a diet with high amounts of sugar and low amounts of fiber are associated with worse sleep quality and quantity. Therefore, we can use sleep as a tool to regulate our body weight and improve our overall health and wellness.
