In this section, Eleanor Longden shares how she started hearing a voice narrating everything she did, and it persisted for days and weeks in third person. While sometimes it mirrored her own emotion, it was mostly companionate and reassuring until she made a fatal mistake of telling a friend who insisted that she seek medical attention. Eleanor, who was desperate for interest and help, told the college G.P. about her strange commentator, which led to her referral to a psychiatrist who took a grim view of the voice's presence, leading to her diagnosis of schizophrenia, a hospital admission, and a toxic sense of hopelessness, humiliation, and despair.

Longden emphasizes the importance of these people empowering her to save herself and helping her understand that her voices were a meaningful response to traumatic life events. She illuminates that the voices each represented aspects of herself that carried overwhelming emotions she had never been able to resolve, and separating out a metaphorical meaning from literal truth was important in interpreting their messages. The most hostile and aggressive voices actually represented the parts of her that were hurt most profoundly, and it was through showing these voices the greatest compassion and care that she was able to gather together her shattered self and ultimately heal.
