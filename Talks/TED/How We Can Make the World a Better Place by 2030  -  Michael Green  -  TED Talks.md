# Summary of How We Can Make the World a Better Place by 2030 | Michael Green | TED Talks

The 2030 Global Goals are ambitious, but achievable according to Michael Green. He outlines how the world's governments have agreed to these goals and what they entail. To measure a country's progress on these goals, Green introduces the Social Progress Index. He concludes that while economic growth is not the only factor in achieving the Global Goals, it is not the main obstacle either.

The speaker describes how the world's governments have agreed new global goals for 2030, which are the product of a massive consultation exercise. The goals are ambitious yet achievable, and while the world still has plenty of problems, the pessimists and doomsayers who say the world can't get better are simply wrong. The speaker uses a tool called the Social Progress Index to measure all the stuff the goals are trying to achieve and finds that the average human being is living on a level of social progress that is above average.

The author provides a brief overview of the Global Goals and how they are ambitious but not impossible to achieve. He then provides a brief overview of the Social Progress Index and how it can be used to calculate whether a country is achieving social progress relative to its GDP. He then shows how the US Department of Agriculture's projections for global economic growth over the next 15 years can be used to estimate how rich a country will be in 2030, and how this affects the Global Goals target of achieving social progress equivalent to 75 out of 100. He concludes that while economic growth alone is not enough to achieve the Global Goals, it is not the main obstacle in achieving them either.
