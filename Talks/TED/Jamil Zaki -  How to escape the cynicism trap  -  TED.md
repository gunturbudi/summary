In this section, the speaker talks about the rise of cynicism and its prevalence in society, even among those who study positive aspects of human nature. He notes a study conducted in southeastern Brazil that showed how social environments can shape individuals into hopeful or cynical versions of themselves. The speaker warns that current times of disaster and heightened inequality are increasing cynicism, which is not only a pessimistic outlook but also detrimental to one's cognitive abilities and decision-making skills.

In this section, the speaker describes how cynicism is a trap that hinders the relationships that we have with others. When people behave cynically, they assume that liars are everywhere and end up creating the exact conditions they fear. In addition, cynicism causes people to refuse intimacy and cooperation, which hurts others to avoid being hurt, and this behavior creates a self-fulfilling mindset. The speaker emphasizes that when we decide that everyone is out for themselves, we stop seeing their kindness, which can lead to a zero-sum mentality, where everyone becomes a potential enemy. Although cynicism is mental malware that affects our lives and culture, the speaker suggests that we can take control of our stories to escape the cynicism trap.

In this section, Jamil Zaki discusses how people's beliefs can change after reading a relevant essay. He found that reading an essay on empathy helped some people become optimistic and others become cynical. Those who became new optimists also became more persuasive and were more likely to encourage other people to change their minds. Zaki encourages people to choose to tell a different story to change the broken system instead of thinking it's a reflection of our broken nature. The key is to be skeptical and hopeful, fight cynicism, and have faith in humanity.
