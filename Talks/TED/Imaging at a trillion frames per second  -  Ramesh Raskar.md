# Summary of Imaging at a trillion frames per second | Ramesh Raskar

This video discusses a new type of photography, femto-photography, which can create slow motion videos of light in motion. The light travels at the speed of light and a million times faster than an ordinary bullet, so femto-photography has the potential to create cameras that can see around corners, be beyond line of sight, or see inside our body without an x-ray.

This video shows a team of scientists at MIT creating a camera that can takeimages at a trillion frames per second. By exploiting the multiplebounces of light that result from shooting at a billion times thespeed of light, the camera is able to reconstruct 3D images of objects that are hidden from view. While this technology is still in its early stages, it has potential applications in fields such as collisionavoidance, endoscopy, and cardiology.
