In this section, the Oâ€™Neills discuss the challenges of disaster relief efforts and how data can enhance recovery.

They discuss how their software, launched in Dallas after tornadoes, provided ease in needs reporting, donations databasing, and remote volunteer access.

Overall, these tools offer a better disaster recovery solution that can work alongside other aid organizations but put the power in the hands of the community.
