# Summary of A climate change solution that's right under our feet | Asmeret Asefaw Berhe

In her talk, "A climate change solution that's right under our feet," Asmeret Asefaw Berhe explains that soil is a long-term storage of carbon and suggests that investing in soil management can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. Healthy soils support diverse habitats for living organisms, and degraded soils release carbon into the atmosphere at a rate 12 times more than the current rate of carbon emissions. Berhe suggests climate-smart land management practices to help maximize soil carbon storage and reduce tillage and other disturbances from agricultural practices. This approach can help sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and offset a third of global carbon emissions if successful.

In this section, Asmeret Asefaw Berhe discusses the important role of soil in combatting climate change. Soil contains three thousand billion metric tons of carbon, 315 times more than what is currently released into the atmosphere. However, natural ecosystems' ability to take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and sequester it in the soil is getting compromised due to human actions. Berhe emphasizes that soil is a bank account: the amount of carbon that's in soil at any given time is a function of the amount of carbon coming in and out of the soil. Hence, investing in soil management can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and maintain the earth's atmosphere.

In this section, Asmeret Asefaw Berhe discusses how soil is a long-term storage of carbon, making it a fundamental component in any climate change mitigation strategy. Carbon stored in soil through physical association with minerals, formation of strong chemical bonds, and entrapping carbon in soil makes it difficult for microbes to degrade the carbon. Healthy soils support diverse habitats for living organisms, and degraded soils compromise plant productivity, hindering our own ability to provide food and resources for living organisms. Soil degradation due to human actions has released 12 times more carbon into the atmosphere than the current rate of carbon emissions, and polar environments storing about a third of global soil carbon reserves are now threatened by permafrost thawing and draining, which could potentially release hundreds of billions of metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere in greenhouse gases.

In this section, Asmeret Asefaw Berhe explains how the solution to the problems of climate change and soil degradation lies in what is called climate-smart land management practices. This involves managing land in a way that maximizes soil carbon storage while reducing tillage and other disturbances from agricultural practices, including optimizing the use of agricultural chemicals and grazing. This approach can help sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and offset a third of global carbon emissions if fully successful, creating healthier and more fertile soils. It not only addresses pressing global challenges but also provides food and nutritional security to the growing human population.
