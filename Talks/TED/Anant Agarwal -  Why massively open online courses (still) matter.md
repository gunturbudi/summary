In this section, Anant Agarwal explains how online education has the potential to transform traditional education as we know it. He argues that education has not evolved much in the past 500 years and needs a complete overhaul to reflect the changes seen in other fields such as healthcare and transportation. Agarwal describes how MOOCs can provide access to education on a massive scale, citing an example of an MIT course that attracted over 155,000 students from 162 countries. He explains that the goal is not just to provide online courses but to use the technology to reimagine education altogether, creating a blended model of learning that combines online and traditional classroom methods.

In this section, Anant Agarwal discusses how the millennial generation is comfortable with online technology, and how educators should embrace this and blend online technologies into students' lives instead of forcing them to attend classes. He advocates for the use of videos and interactive exercises for self-pacing and active learning in the comfort of students' own homes, followed by in-person interaction in classrooms. He also emphasizes the importance of instant feedback and discusses some key ideas that make this blended learning approach work, such as active learning, self-pacing, and instant feedback.

In this section, Anant Agarwal talks about the benefits of instant feedback, gamification, and peer learning in massive open online courses (MOOCs). With instant feedback, students receive immediate feedback on their exercises and can try again to get the right answer, making the process much more engaging. Gamification uses interactive videos and online labs, which is how Anant teaches creativity and design. Peer learning is also an important aspect, encouraging learners to interact the way they would on Facebook, providing him with an epiphany that students can learn from each other, allowing them to teach and learn at the same time without the need of a professor.
