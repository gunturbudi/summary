# Summary of The Great Migration and the power of a single decision | Isabel Wilkerson

Isabel Wilkerson discusses the Great Migration, during which six million African Americans migrated from the Jim Crow South to the North and West, seeking political asylum within their own country. The caste system in the South determined social status based on race and required violence to maintain. The migration allowed talented individuals such as musicians and writers to pursue their passions freely. The migrants proved their power by leaving, becoming the advance guard of the civil rights movement and freeing themselves.

In this section, the speaker sets the stage by describing the difficult decision of leaving everything behind to embark on a journey towards an unknown future. Migration is a young person's endeavor, and throughout our families' backgrounds, we can find those who made sacrifices to ensure our existence. Six million African Americans migrated from the Jim Crow South to the North and West of the country during the Great Migration, seeking political asylum within their own country. It was the first time American citizens had to flee their birthplace to be recognized as citizens, defying the Jim Crow caste system's artificial hierarchy.

In this section, Isabel Wilkerson discusses the caste system that existed in the Jim Crow South of the United States, which determined one's social status based on their race. She describes how this artificially created hierarchy required a tremendous amount of violence to maintain and how, on average, every four days, an African American was lynched due to this caste system in the decades leading up to the Great Migration. The migration began when the North had a labor problem, and it decided to search for cheap labor in the South, where many African Americans were not even being paid for their work. However, the South did not take kindly to this poaching of cheap labor and did everything in its power to keep the people from leaving, including arresting them from railroad platforms and train seats.

In this section, the consequences of the Great Migration, which saw nearly half of African Americans move away from the South, are discussed. Through this, an entire people were nearly completely redistributed. For the first time, the lowest caste people had options and were willing to take them. Great talents such as opera singers, jazz musicians, playwrights, novelists, surgeons, attorneys, accountants, professors, and journalists were finally given the chance to express themselves freely. The Great Migration was a key factor in said talents being given the chance to pursue their paths in life. Without the Great Migration, music like Motown would not exist and the world would be without the likes of Diana Ross.

In this section, Isabel Wilkerson highlights how the single decision made by millions of African American people who migrated during the Great Migration had made an impact in changing the region they had been forced to leave. Resisting tremendous resistance, they were able to become the advance guard of the civil rights movement, proving that they had more power by leaving than staying. By their actions, they were able to do what the Emancipation Proclamation could not, as they freed themselves.
