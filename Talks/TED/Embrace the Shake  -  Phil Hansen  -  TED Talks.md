Phil took this advice to heart and found ways to create by embracing the limitations of his shake, experimenting with new techniques and materials that he wouldn't have previously considered.

Instead of relying solely on himself, he sought out others' input, took to living-streaming his life, and even began destroying his pieces after creation.
