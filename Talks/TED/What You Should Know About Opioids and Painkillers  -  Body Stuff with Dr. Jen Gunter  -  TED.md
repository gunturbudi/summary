Opioids are one of the most commonly prescribed painkillers, but there are a number of misconceptions about them. Opioids work by binding to and activating the opioid receptors located throughout the body, blocking pain signals. This activation also triggers the release of dopamine, a hormone associated with pleasure. In higher doses, opioids can affect cognition and even breathing. However, there is a risk of developing physical dependence and addiction if opioids are not used carefully.
