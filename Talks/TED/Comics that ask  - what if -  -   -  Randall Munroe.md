# Summary of Comics that ask "what if?" | Randall Munroe

Randall Munroe discusses how he answers hypothetical questions on his website using math, science, and comics. He shares examples of questions he received, including what happens when a baseball is pitched at 90 percent of the speed of light and how big Google's data warehouse would be if all digital data were stored on punch cards. Munroe breaks down how he used publicly available information to estimate Google's data to be at 10 exabytes, which is more than any other organization in the world. Munroe enjoys doing these kinds of calculations because it allows him to find out something surprising from things that he already knows.

He explains how the ball would break apart and trigger waves of thermonuclear fusion in the air around it, leaving a mushroom cloud over the stadium. He also talks about a question he received on Google, asking how big their data warehouse would be if all digital data in the world were stored on punch cards.

In this section, Randall Munroe discusses the process he went through to estimate the amount of data that Google has across its operations. Using publicly available information, he was able to come up with an estimate of 10 exabytes of data, which is more than any other organization in the world has. To put this into perspective, he tries to calculate how many punch cards it would take to store this amount of data, and Google actually sent him a bunch of punch cards with a puzzle on it as a response to his article. Ultimately, Munroe explains that he loves doing these kinds of calculations because it allows him to find out something surprising from things that he already knows.
