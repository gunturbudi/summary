# Summary of How to read the genome and build a human being | Riccardo Sabatini

In this video, Riccardo Sabatini explains how to read the genome and build a human being. He discusses the challenges involved in predicting individual features, but remains optimistic about the potential for human progress.

This video explains how to read the genome and build a human being, and Dr. Craig Venter is on stage to demonstrate. The book that he is reading has sequences of letters that correspond to the color of his eyes.

Chromosome 14, book 132, contains the genetic information for a human being. The book is a miracle of life that contains 500 pages of information, but the rest of us are all completely identical. The human genome is just about half a book, and the rest of our genetic information is shared among all of us.

In 2014, two famous TEDsters, Peter Diamandis and Craig Venter, founded Human Longevity with the mission of learning everything we can from these books to develop personalized medicine. The team uses a technology called machine learning to read the genomes of subjects and predict their phenotypes, including height, eye color, skin color, and age.

In October of this year, the first signals of success were seen with the prediction of a human face. This is a significant achievement, as faces are not well-defined objects and are scattered among millions of letters in the genome. After 15 years of work, the team is getting closer to understanding the human genome and developing personalized medicine.

This video provides an overview of genome sequencing, including a description of the challenges involved in predicting individual features such as age, race, and height. It then introduces the idea of "personalized medicine" - the ability to treat individuals as unique, rather than using a statistical approach. The speaker demonstrates how a machine learning algorithm can be used to predict features of a person's face, and reveals that the subject is, in fact, himself.

This video by Riccardo Sabatini explains how to read the genome and build a human being. Sabatini is open about the risks and challenges of this process, but he remains optimistic about the potential for human progress.
