In this section, Barry Schwartz discusses the concept of practical wisdom, which he defines as the combination of moral will and moral skill. He uses the example of hospital janitors to illustrate the importance of human interactions involving kindness, care, and empathy in improving the quality of patient care. Although the janitors' job descriptions do not mention anything about other human beings, the ones who possess practical wisdom know when and how to make exceptions to rules, how to improvise, and how to use moral skills to serve others. Schwartz argues that wisdom is not innate but learned through experience and mentoring by wise teachers.

In this section of the video, Barry Schwartz discusses the dangers of relying solely on rules and incentives. He argues that neither of these is enough to create a situation where people can act with moral skill and will, and that the over-reliance on them creates a "war on wisdom." Schwartz gives examples such as the lemonade story, in which a child is taken away from his father due to the enforcement of rules, and the nature of modern American education, which is heavily scripted and does not allow for improvisation or learning from mistakes. He suggests that there needs to be a more balanced approach to regulations that allows for both freedom and responsibility.

In this section, Barry Schwartz discusses the pitfalls of rules and incentives and their impact on professionalism. While he acknowledges that rules are necessary, excessive ones can lead to mediocrity and the loss of creativity and great talent in many industries, including music. Incentives are not foolproof either, as they can lead to focusing solely on personal gain rather than responsibilities to one's community. When incentives become the focus, people stop asking "is it right?" and instead, ask "what serves my interest?," which is demoralizing for professionals and the industries they work in. To counteract this, Schwartz suggests celebrating moral exemplars and demanding that they be acknowledged by institutions.
