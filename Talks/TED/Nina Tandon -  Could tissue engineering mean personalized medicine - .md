# Summary of Nina Tandon: Could tissue engineering mean personalized medicine?

Nina Tandon explains how tissue engineering is transforming drug screening by engineering tissues from induced pluripotent stem cells, which can be grown into different types of tissues and simulated on a 'chip'. Human diversity in drug trial tests can be factored in with these models and they can also lead to faster drug discovery, combine with microfluidics technology for an entire ecosystem of the human body on a chip with multiple organs to test how a drug affects the body. This could lead to personalizing cancer treatment by testing how drugs work on patients' cancerous cells beforehand, reduce animal and human testing, and ultimately result in individualized therapies.

In this section, Nina Tandon discusses how tissue engineering is revolutionizing the drug screening process. Tissues engineered from induced pluripotent stem cells can be grown into practically any type of tissue, brain, liver, heart and can simulate a patient’s actual organ on a chip. As a result, these models can factor human diversity in drug trial tests and discover faster drug discovery. Combining tissue engineering methods with microfluidics technology, can create an entire ecosystem of the human body on a chip with multiple organs to test how a drug affects the body properly, and this could lead to personalizing cancer treatment by testing how the drugs work on the patient’s cancerous cells beforehand.

In this section, we learn about how tissue engineering could potentially revolutionize the field of drug screening. The creation of disease models using tissue engineering could lead to better drug formulations, while multi-tissue chips will be the next generation of studying how cancer spreads through the body. Tissue engineering could also help reduce animal and human testing in clinical trials and ultimately lead to individualized therapies. This transformation of biotechnology and pharmacology into an information technology would allow for faster, cheaper, and more effective drug discovery and evaluation.
