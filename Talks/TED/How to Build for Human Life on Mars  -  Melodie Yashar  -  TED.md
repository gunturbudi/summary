This TED talk by space architect Melodie Yashar discusses how to build human habitats on Mars using autonomous robots. Yashar believes that using 3D printing and other construction robots to build structures layer-by-layer will enable us to create airtight, habitable structures that can withstand internal pressure and extreme temperatures. She also discusses the importance of incorporating practical architectural elements like access to natural light and greenery into Martian habitats. The talk concludes with Yashar discussing the need for long-duration human missions to Mars to be designed in a way that fosters psychological well-being.

In order to build human-friendly habitats on Mars, designers are looking to the Moon as a testbed. They are also working on technologies that can be used on future missions to Mars. One example is 3D printing, which can be used to build structures that are both durable and resilient. These technologies have implications for Earth, where they can be used to solve problems like homelessness and climate change.
