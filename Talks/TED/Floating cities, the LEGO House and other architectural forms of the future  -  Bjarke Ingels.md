# Summary of Floating cities, the LEGO House and other architectural forms of the future | Bjarke Ingels

Architect Bjarke Ingels describes his innovative designs for a range of projects, including the playful LEGO House and a floating community that could incorporate sustainable and renewable resources to create a self-sustaining ecosystem. His team's designs also involve waste-to-energy power plants, student housing made of stacked shipping containers, and a flood protection system in Manhattan. Ingels believes that humans possess the collective superpower to adapt to change and create sustainable solutions, urging viewers to design a better future for all.

In this section, Bjarke Ingels discusses his work with the LEGO House in Billund, Denmark, where they designed a building that is as interactive and playful as LEGO itself. He also talks about his design philosophy of "formgivning", which means to give form to the future. Ingels shares various examples of his work, including a social housing project in Copenhagen and a headquarters building in China, which are both highly adapted to their respective surroundings. Additionally, he discusses his concept of a "courtscraper," which combines a Copenhagen courtyard building with an American skyscraper in Manhattan. Lastly, Ingels mentions the waste-to-energy power plant his team is completing on the Copenhagen waterfront.

In this section, architect Bjarke Ingels discusses his team's innovative projects, including a waste-to-energy power plant in Copenhagen with an alpine ski slope on its roof, and student housing made of stacked shipping containers that float on the city's clean port. Ingels also describes his team's efforts to design a flood protection system in Manhattan, with help from its citizens, that is both functional and enjoyable, and a floating city that could incorporate all of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals into a self-sustaining ecosystem. He argues that these visionary designs could help redefine the future of architecture and inspire future generations.

In this section, architect Bjarke Ingels explains a master plan he and his team have created for a floating community of 300 people that can be scaled up to a city of 10,000 people. This man-made archipelago is designed with the idea of using all of the available renewable resources, including the force of the tides, currents, waves, wind, heat, and energy of the sun, and collecting and dealing with rainwater organically and mechanically. All agriculture will be fish-and-plant based, buildings will be modular, buoyant, and designed to resist tropical storms, and every structure must be relatively low to maintain a center of gravity that is buoyant. The platform can be fitted with any architecture, and materials will be light and renewable, like bamboo and wood. All waste will be managed and composted, and underground biorock will be used to create new reefs to regenerate habitat. The group has already investigated several locations, with the Pearl River delta being given particular emphasis.

In this section, Bjarke Ingels highlights the human ability to adapt to change and shape the future. He believes that despite the current crisis, humans possess a collective superpower that allows them to overcome adversities and create sustainable solutions, such as floating cities and innovative architectural designs like the LEGO House. Ingels encourages viewers to tap into this power and use it to design a better future for all.
