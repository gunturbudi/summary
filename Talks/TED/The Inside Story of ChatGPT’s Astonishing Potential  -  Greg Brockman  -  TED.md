# Summary of The Inside Story of ChatGPTâ€™s Astonishing Potential | Greg Brockman | TED

Sure, in this section of the video, Greg Brockman discusses the role of AI in improving education. He argues that traditional education methods are often inefficient and ineffective, with students struggling to retain knowledge and teachers struggling to teach in a way that engages every student. Brockman suggests that AI could help to solve these problems by providing personalized learning experiences for each student. With AI tools, it is possible to monitor student progress in real-time, adjusting the curriculum to their needs and preferences. This could lead to more engaging and efficient learning experiences, allowing students to retain more knowledge and teachers to focus on more important tasks. Brockman also emphasizes the importance of designing AI tools with privacy in mind, ensuring that student data is protected and used only for educational purposes.

In this section, Greg Brockman, the CEO of OpenAI, demonstrated the capabilities of an AI tool called Dolly that builds tools for AIs. By using this tool with ChatGPT, users can generate images and text to achieve their intent with a unified language interface, allowing them to take away small details and checks it by incorporating it with other applications. This new way of thinking about a user interface will expand the capabilities of what AI can do on the user's behalf and take the technology to newer heights.

In this section, Greg Brockman explains how the AI is trained to use the tools and produce the desired outcome through feedback. The process has two steps - first, an unsupervised learning process is used where the AI is shown the whole world and asked to predict what comes next in text it has never seen before. The second step involves human feedback where the AI is taught what to do with those skills by trying out multiple things, and human feedback is provided to reinforce the whole process used to produce the answer. This feedback allows it to generalize and apply the learning to new situations. The AI is also used to fact check and can issue search queries and write out its whole chain of thought, making it more efficient to verify any piece of the chain of reasoning.

In this section of the video, Greg Brockman discusses the potential for collaboration between humans and AI in solving complex problems. He shows an example of a fact-checking tool that requires human input to produce useful data for another AI, demonstrating how humans can provide management, oversight, and feedback while machines operate in a trustworthy and inspectable manner. Brockman believes this will lead to solving previously impossible problems, including rethinking how we interact with computers. He demonstrates how ChatGPT, a powerful AI language model, can be used to analyze a spreadsheet of 167,000 AI papers and provide insights through exploratory graphs, showing the potential for AI to assist with data analysis and decision-making.

In this section, Greg Brockman discusses the potential of AI, stating that getting it right will require the participation of everyone in setting the rules and guidelines for its integration into our daily lives. He believes that achieving the OpenAI mission of ensuring that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity is possible through literacy and the willingness to rethink the way we do things. Brockman acknowledges that while the technology is amazing, it is also scary, as it requires rethinking everything we currently do. The success of OpenAI's chatGPT model is due in part to their deliberate choices, confronting reality, and encouraging collaboration among diverse teams. Brockman also attributes the emergence of new possibilities to the growth of language models and the principle of emergence, where many simple components can lead to complex emergent behaviors.

In this section of the video, Greg Brockman discusses the astonishing potential of ChatGPT's ability to learn and predict, even in areas that were not explicitly taught to the machine. However, he notes that while the machine can handle adding 40 digit numbers, it will often get an addition problem wrong when presented with a 40 digit number and a 35 digit number. Brockman also emphasizes the importance of engineering quality with machine learning, rebuilding the entire stack to ensure every piece is properly engineered before doing predictions. He acknowledges that scaling up such technology could lead to unpredictable outcomes, but believes in deploying incremental change to properly supervise and align the machine's intent with ours. Ultimately, Brockman believes that with proper feedback and integration with humans, the journey to truth and wisdom with AI is possible.

In this section, Greg Brockman addresses concerns about the responsibility and safety implications of releasing artificial intelligence (AI) like GPT without proper guardrails. He explains that the default plan of building in secret and then hoping safety is properly executed is terrifying and doesn't feel right. Instead, he argues that the alternative approach is to release the AI and allow people to give input before they become too powerful. Brockman shares a story of contemplating whether he would want the technology to be 5 years or 500 years away, concluding that it's better to approach this right with collective responsibility and provide guardrails for the AI to be wise rather than reckless.
