In this section, Melinda and Bill Gates discuss how their trip to Africa led to the creation of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. They were deeply moved by the people they met and the extreme poverty they saw. On a beach walk, they talked about giving back the wealth that came from Microsoft, and this led to their post-Microsoft philanthropy phase. They decided to focus on the biggest global inequities, which for them were children dying, children not having enough nutrition, countries that were stuck due to a high death rate, and a lack of education systems in the US. They chose these two areas of focus, and everything the foundation does is centered on them. Melinda also shares how talking to women in rural areas about vaccines in developing countries led her to realize that women wanted more access to contraceptives, which became a critical focus for their foundation.

She acknowledged the political controversies around contraceptives, which have held back women of their basic rights to prevent pregnancy, and how she wanted to eradicate it as her primary goal. Bill then shows a graph on the number of children who die before the age of five every year, showcasing the earth's progress in saving children's lives using vaccines. Although the reduction in their deaths is phenomenal, it is not widely known, and Bill condemns this trend, explaining how natural disasters always receive more donation compared to real-world issues, and his goal is to bring it below a million deaths, which is possible in our lifetime.
