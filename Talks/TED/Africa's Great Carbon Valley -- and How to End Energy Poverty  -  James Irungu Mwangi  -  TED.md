# Summary of Africa's Great Carbon Valley -- and How to End Energy Poverty | James Irungu Mwangi | TED

In his TED Talk, James Irungu Mwangi discusses the importance of carbon removal to combat climate change and potential methods for achieving it, including natural interventions like reforestation and soil carbon sequestration, as well as engineered approaches like BECCS and BiCRS. He emphasizes the need for renewable energy sources to expedite current and future carbon removal processes without significant climate action tradeoffs. Kenya has the potential to harness its sustainable energy resources, but a quarter of its population still lacks access to basic electricity. Introducing energy-hungry climate technologies like DAC in areas like the Rift Valley can provide the required capacity and incentivize investment in renewable energy, ultimately helping Africa become substantially net-negative in carbon emissions.

In this section, the speaker discusses the need for carbon removal to combat global climate change and the potential methods to achieve it. He emphasizes the importance of reducing emissions drastically while simultaneously working towards removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The speaker mentions interventions such as reforestation and soil carbon sequestration as natural ways to remove carbon, but highlights their limitations. Engineered approaches such as BECCS and BiCRS are also mentioned as effective methods for removing carbon, but there is a need for exponential scaling to achieve the necessary multi-billion-ton scale required by 2050.

In this section, the speaker highlights the need for renewable energy sources to expedite current and future DAC processes without significant climate action tradeoffs. He points out that scaling these technologies in areas where fossil fuel emissions are still being produced does not make sense since every unit of renewable energy should be utilized to displace and retire existing fossil fuel capacity. However, Kenya seems to have a perfect opportunity as the country has ample geothermal, wind and solar resources, with an estimated 50 GW of deployable renewable energy capacity that can be accessed with the right level of investment. Despite this, more than a quarter of Kenyan population still does not have access to basic electricity, thus providing an opportunity for the country to harness and utilize its sustainable energy potential.

In this section, the speaker explains the paradox of energy economics in countries such as Kenya, where energy is expensive because consumers on the grid pay for unused capacity, while high energy prices make the country uncompetitive for manufacturers and other industries that need energy, perpetuating the cycle of insufficient demand. However, introducing energy-hungry climate technology such as DAC in areas like the Rift Valley can provide the required capacity and incentivize investment in the country's renewable energy potential. This, in turn, has the potential to activate the imagination and energy of Africa's young workforce towards becoming climate innovators and solution builders, and subsequently helping the continent to become substantially net-negative in carbon emissions.
