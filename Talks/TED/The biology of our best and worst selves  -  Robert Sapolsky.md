# Summary of The biology of our best and worst selves | Robert Sapolsky

In his TED Talk, Robert Sapolsky delves into the complex biology behind our behavior and emphasizes the importance of understanding the multiple levels of causality that come into play in a person's decision-making process. He discusses how genes, hormones, environment, experiences, and even evolutionary history can influence a person's behavior, and uses examples of individuals who were able to transform from negative to positive behaviors. Sapolsky stresses the importance of studying these transformations to better understand human behavior and prevent repeating our darkest moments in the future. The talk is praised as a memorable and insightful exploration of the biology of our best and worst selves.

In this section, Robert Sapolsky talks about the human fascination with violence, but also acknowledges our altruistic, compassionate nature. He discusses how understanding the biology of behavior requires looking beyond just motoric aspects and delving into the context and meaning behind it. Sapolsky stresses the importance of recognizing that behavior has multiple levels of causality and cannot be linked to a single brain region, hormone, gene, childhood experience, or evolutionary mechanism. He uses an example involving someone pulling a trigger in a crisis situation to explore how complex understanding behavior can be.

In this section, Robert Sapolsky explains the complex factors that come into play in the moments leading up to an action. He goes back to the level of hormones, environment, experiences, and even the evolutionary history of humans over the past millions of years to explain how genes and environment interact to influence a person's behavior. From the level of stress hormones to the role of culture and evolution, Sapolsky emphasizes the intricate web of factors that come together in a person's "one critical moment" of decision-making.

In this section, we learn about the ability of biology to change under varying circumstances, which can manifest as changes in ecosystems, cultures, and even the brain. Three examples of human change are given, each one demonstrating significant and lasting turns from negative to positive. These include John Newton, an abolitionist who turned away from growing rich from slavery, Zenji Abe, a former pilot who apologised for attacking Pearl Harbor, and the World War I Christmas truce of 1914, which gave soldiers on both sides a new sense of camaraderie that broke free of preconceived notions of "us" and "them." Ironically, the section concludes that we must study history to reinforce the importance of studying it so that we can avoid repeating its darkest moments in the future.

In this section, Robert Sapolsky emphasizes the importance of studying the biology and history of human transformation from our worst to our best behaviors. He warns that those who fail to do so will not be able to achieve exceptional moments of change. Sapolsky's talk is commended as a memorable TED Talk that provides new mental models. The audience applauds him and expresses their desire to have him as a speaker in person one year.
