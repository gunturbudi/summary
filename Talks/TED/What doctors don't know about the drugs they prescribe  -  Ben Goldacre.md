# Summary of What doctors don't know about the drugs they prescribe | Ben Goldacre

Ben Goldacre discusses the issues of publication bias and missing clinical trial data in the medical industry. He highlights examples of the dangers that arise when only positive results are published, such as the disastrous prescription of anti-arrhythmic drugs. Goldacre calls for a change in the academic journal system and for pharmaceutical companies to publish all clinical trial data, so that doctors can make informed decisions about the drugs they prescribe.

In this section, Ben Goldacre discusses how the academic journal system and the pursuit of positive results can lead to biases, causing inaccurate conclusions to be drawn and resulting in dangerous outcomes. He gives examples from precognition studies, cancer research, and the medical industry where the publication of only positive results led to the disastrous prescription of anti-arrhythmic drugs, causing over 100,000 deaths. Goldacre calls for a change in the academic journal system where negative results should be published and more scientists should be incentivized to do so, to allow a more accurate picture of scientific studies to be seen.

In this section, Goldacre discusses the phenomenon of publication bias, where unflattering data from clinical trials goes missing and is left unpublished. He highlights that over half of all trials go missing in action, and positive findings are twice as likely to be published as negative ones. Goldacre discusses the drug reboxetine, which he had prescribed, and explains that only one of seven trials conducted was published, which showed that the drug was better than placebo. However, six negative trials were left unpublished, leaving doctors misled about the drug's effectiveness. Goldacre asserts that this issue with publication bias is a cancer at the core of evidence-based medicine and must be addressed.

In this section, Ben Goldacre explains how the withholding of clinical trial data by pharmaceutical companies is a major issue that prevents doctors from fully understanding the benefits and risks of drugs they are prescribing. Goldacre cites examples of the Tamiflu drug and how missing data may have skewed the perception of its effectiveness. Although there have been attempts to fix the problem by mandating that all trials in humans must be published, the lack of compliance among pharmaceutical companies has not resolved the issue. He highlights the need to publish all trials, including older ones, for all current drugs so that doctors can provide the best possible treatment.
