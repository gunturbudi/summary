# Summary of How CRISPR lets us edit our DNA | Jennifer Doudna

CRISPR is a gene-editing technology that has the potential to change the DNA of cells in order to cure genetic diseases. However, there are also ethical concerns that need to be considered before moving forward with any clinical applications.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
CRISPR-Cas9 is a technology for editing genomes. CRISPR-Cas9 allows scientists to make changes to the DNA in cells that could allow them to cure genetic disease. CRISPR-Cas9 came about through a basic research project aimed at understanding how bacteria fight viral infections. CRISPR-Cas9 has already been used to change the DNA in the cells of mice and monkeys, other organisms as well. Chinese scientists showed recently that they could even use the CRISPR technology to change genes in human embryos. And scientists in Philadelphia showed they could use CRISPR to remove the DNA of an integrated HIV virus from infected human cells. The opportunity to do this kind of genome editing also raises various ethical issues that we have to consider.

The CRISPR technology is a very precise way to break and repair DNA. It is being used to study how changing the DNA of cells affects tissues and whole organisms.

Jennifer Doudna discusses the potential implications of CRISPR technology, which she believes has the potential to greatly improve our lives in many ways. However, she also emphasizes the importance of taking the time to carefully consider the risks and potential consequences before moving forward with any clinical applications. A meeting is planned in December to discuss this and other issues surrounding CRISPR technology.

Jennifer Doudna discusses the potential implications of CRISPR, a gene-editing technology, and how it could be used in other fields. She believes that scientists should be more involved in the genesis of new technologies, and that other technologies should be considered in the same way as gene editing.
