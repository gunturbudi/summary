# Summary of A For-Profit Mindset for Nonprofit Success | Tolu Oyekan | TED

Tulu Oyekan argues that for-profit organizations and nonprofits should be similar in terms of their impact, but that for-profit organizations operate with a higher sense of urgency due to their annual accountability to investors. He suggests experiments in Nigeria that used agent banking to provide financial access to the population without the high costs and time requirements of traditional development projects.

This TED talk by Tolu Oyekan discusses the problem of financial access in Nigeria, and how by deploying "agent banking" models, the number of Nigerians with access to financial services can be increased. The talk also discusses the importance of having 500 adults in the community support each agent, and the fact that agent banking is not a full-time business but rather a side hustle that can be offered as an add-on to other occupations. Geofin, a software designed to estimate the number of agents needed to reach universal coverage, is introduced.
