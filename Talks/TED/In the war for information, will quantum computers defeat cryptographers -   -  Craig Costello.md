# Summary of In the war for information, will quantum computers defeat cryptographers? | Craig Costello

Craig Costello discusses the potential of quantum computers and their potential to defeat cryptographers. He explains that while these computers are still in their early stages, they hold the potential to revolutionize the cryptography field. Even with quantum computers, however, many of the most complex mathematical problems will remain unbreakable.

Cryptographers protect information using codes, but quantum computers could break these codes. Public-key cryptography allows for secure communication regardless of whether the parties have communicated before.Integer factorization is the process of finding the two numbers that multiply to give a given number, which is used to protect data in smartphones and laptops. However, physicists have recently discovered that the laws of the universe are not as we thought they were, meaning that some objects can be in two places at the same time. This means that current cryptography may not be able to protect data forever.

Quantum computers promise to be able to solve problems much faster than classical computers, but they also have the potential to break current encryption methods.

Quantum computing is still in its early stages, but its potential is immense. With enough qubits, quantum computers can work with exponentially more combinations of 0 and 1 than a classical computer. This could allow for the extraction of secret information from encrypted data. Cryptographers are currently looking for difficult mathematical problems that can be solved on today's technology, but are already too late to protect data from quantum computing.
