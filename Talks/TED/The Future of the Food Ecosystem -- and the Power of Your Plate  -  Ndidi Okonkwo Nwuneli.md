In this section, Ndidi Okonkwo Nwuneli discusses the broken state of the food ecosystem and the urgent need for action to be taken from the perspectives of health, equity, and climate change. The food system is one of the largest contributors to climate change, and we must modify how we grow food and reduce food waste through technology and science. Examples of such solutions include regenerative agriculture and zero-waste total production, which can be scaled and incentivized through government, private sector, and individual actions. Additionally, we must ensure that healthy food is accessible and affordable for the most vulnerable, as unhealthy food is responsible for one out of every five deaths.

In this section, Ndidi Okonkwo Nwuneli discusses the importance of healthy food and its impact on peopleâ€™s lives. She highlights the challenge that one-third of the world's population faces in affording a healthy diet, particularly during times of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. She suggests that we must learn from African communities, such as the Hadzabe people in Tanzania, who live harmoniously with the land and have a healthy diet based on plant-based food. Ndidi also stresses the need to hold companies accountable for the amount of sugar and salt included in their products and to define healthy food as plant-based with low salt and sugar content. She further emphasizes the importance of supporting small- and medium-sized enterprises that create jobs, particularly women-owned businesses, to build healthy food companies and become change agents in the food ecosystem.

In this section, Ndidi Okonkwo Nwuneli emphasizes the importance of understanding the journey that food takes before it reaches our plates, including who grew it, where it was grown, when it was grown, and how many steps and stops it made. She also highlights the significant amount of food waste generated by our food ecosystem and encourages individuals to let their choices influence their next meal. She highlights that having a choice gives individuals a voice to demand that the solutions to the food ecosystem align with what works for people and the planet. Ultimately, Nwuneli calls for a shared responsibility to create a food ecosystem that works for future generations, as our children and grandchildren will hold us accountable for our actions today.
