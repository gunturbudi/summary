In this section of the transcript, Michael Kimmel talks about the obstacles to engaging men in the gender equality movement. Some men are prematurely self-congratulatory and think that they'll take it from here as if men are cavalry coming to save women. In contrast, some actively resist gender equality, believing that it's detrimental to men. The obstacles to engaging men in gender equality lie in men's sense of entitlement, which needs to be confronted if the movement is to be successful. Moreover, gender equality is in men's interests since gender-equal countries are also the happiest and gender-equal companies are less costly due to less job turnover, lower attrition rates, and higher productivity.
