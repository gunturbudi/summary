She talks about how people seem to be fascinated with finding out about new superfoods and whether gluten is bad for them, but hardly anyone seems to care about the gut, which is responsible for digestion. Enders explains that the gut is complex and fascinating, with a lot of surface area, immune cells, hormones, and bacteria.

In this section, Giulia Enders discusses how looking closer at bodily functions related to the gut can help people appreciate themselves more. For example, the noises made by the small intestine aren’t hunger pangs, they are the sounds of an efficient cleaning system, and the shape of the stomach helps liquid or gases move up instead of sideways when needed. Enders then explores the connection between the brain and the gut, explaining how 90% of nerves connecting these organs deliver information from the gut to the brain. This means that the gut is essential in helping the brain to form a picture of the body’s overall wellbeing, which can be why people with irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease are more prone to anxiety and depression.
