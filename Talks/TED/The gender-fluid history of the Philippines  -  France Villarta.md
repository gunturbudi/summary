Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
The author was born in the Philippines in the mid-1990s and grew up in a one-bedroom house with five other siblings. At that age, he was oblivious to society's expectations of gender, but aware of what was happening around him. Lenie, an eight-year-old transgender woman, was a family friend and frequently walked down the street being greeted with smiles. Spanish words peppered everyday Filipino conversations and many of the author's last names sounded Spanish because Spanish was the colonial rule at the time. The author's mother was a shaman and his grandmother was a babaylan, a collective term for shamans of various ethnic groups in the Philippines.

The gender-fluid history of the Philippines is long and complex, with Spanish missionaries struggling to understand and impose their two-sex, two-gender model on pre-colonial societies. Male practitioners of the babaylan spiritual tradition were often cross-dressing and appeared effeminate or sexually ambiguous, and some married women. Contemporary debates about gender and identity are relevant to this history, as the prevailing notions of man and woman as static genders are social constructs that can be reconstructed to fit a time and age. The Filipino people are an important example of a community that has struggled to define and accept its own gender identity, and their resilience inspires others to fight for their own rights.
