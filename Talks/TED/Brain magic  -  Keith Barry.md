In this section, Keith Barry demonstrates how easy it is to manipulate the human mind through simple instructions and linguistic deception. He uses a hand exercise to show how people can be led into making mistakes without realizing it. Barry also shares a story about a blind 75-year-old Russian woman who could sense printed letters and colors through touch. He attempted to give a similar demonstration of second sight, whereby a mind-control expert can see through somebody elseâ€™s eyes. In the video, he takes a TV host to a secret location while she is blindfolded and guides her to the location by seeing through her eyes.

In this section, Keith Barry impresses the audience with his ability to direct attention and deceive people's minds. He calls two volunteers on stage and sets up a voodoo experiment where he touches one person's back and the other person feels the touch on their arm. Keith also puts one of the volunteers in a relaxed state without hypnotizing him and asks him to feel the pressure and allow his hand to float back when the pressure is released.

In this section, mentalist Keith Barry performs two mind-bending tricks. In the first, he instructs two volunteers to point at each other's forehead and control each other's pressure in their fingers, up or down. In the second, he uses psychokinesis as he instructs a volunteer to channel negative energy from a broken relationship into a shard of glass that he then drops into a solid Coke bottle. The energy shatters the bottle on impact, leading to laughter and applause from the audience. Finally, he invites a volunteer on stage to pick someone else to participate in his next experiment.

In this section, Keith Barry performs a magic trick where a lucky member of the audience named Steve is chosen to participate. Steve is asked to hide a spike underneath one of four wooden cups, all placed on the plinths. After a few mix-ups, Keith puts on a blindfold, and Steve moves all the cups again. Keith is riskily tasked with placing his hand on top of a cup while being blindfolded while Steve watchfully guides him on top of a cup he thinks doesn't have the spike. Steve doesn't consent to swap the places of the cups when asked to touch them with both his hands, but Keith ends up guessing the right cup with the spike while having a bit of fun. The trick's overall psychological nature is a mystery.
