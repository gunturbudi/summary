# Summary of What a digital government looks like | Anna Piperal

The video discusses the history and current situation of Estonia, which is considered to be one of the most digital societies on earth. Estonia has eliminated most of the bureaucratic red tape and procedures that were previously used to interact with the government. All interactions are now done through digital means, including tax declarations. The digital government described in this video is based on the principle that individuals are the owners of the data collected about them, and that every time a state officer accesses personal information, they first have to login and access information they are authorized to see. Additionally, every time they make a request for data, this is logged and is available for public scrutiny. The video also describes the Estonian system's use of blockchain to ensure the integrity of data.
