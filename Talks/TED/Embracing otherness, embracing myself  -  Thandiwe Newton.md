# Summary of Embracing otherness, embracing myself | Thandiwe Newton

In this video, Thandiwe Newton reflects on her journey of self-discovery and her evolving understanding of race and the concept of self. She initially found solace in acting, where she could lose herself in a role, but eventually realized that her self-worth was still tied to societal values. Through education and therapy, she learned that the concept of race is not scientifically based and that the creation of self is a projection of our brains. Newton encourages embracing oneness and connecting to our essence for true fulfillment and progress. She argues that by honoring the inevitable death of self and finding connection with the infinite and every living thing, we can appreciate the privilege of life and marvel at what comes next.

In this section of the video, Thandiwe Newton reflects on the concept of self and identity, and how her own experiences growing up as a mixed-race child in England shaped her sense of otherness. She discusses the idea that the self is not a constant or inherent aspect of who we are, but rather a projection based on other people's projections. Newton also shares that she found refuge in dancing, where she could lose herself and express herself emotionally in a way that was not possible in her real life or sense of self. At 16, she stumbled upon her first acting role in a film, which opened up a new opportunity for her to explore different identities and ways of being.

In this section, Thandiwe Newton discusses how she used to lack a sense of self, which allowed her to feel deeply connected to others' pain, leading her to believe she had nothing of her own to offer. However, she later realized that her self is a projection that has a function, and stopped giving it so much authority. By living more from her essence, she is now able to celebrate life with those who have survived unthinkable pain, and encourages others to do the same rather than perpetuate an epidemic of disconnection. Ultimately, she argues that by honoring the inevitable death of self and finding connection with the infinite and every living thing, we can appreciate the privilege of life and marvel at what comes next.
