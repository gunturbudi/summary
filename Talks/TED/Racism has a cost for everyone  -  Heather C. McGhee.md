# Summary of Racism has a cost for everyone | Heather C. McGhee

In this video, activist Heather C. McGhee talks about the cost of racism for everyone. McGhee recounts a call-in to a public television show by a man named Gary who admitted he was prejudiced and wanted to change his ways. This led the speaker to question whether racism disadvantages not only people of color but also harms the beneficiaries of white privilege. McGhee cites examples of how racism leads to bad policymaking, such as the underinvestment in public goods like schools and roads, and negatively affects everyone. She also examines the financial cost of racism, citing the 2008 financial crisis that was exacerbated by discrimination against minority middle-class communities. In addition, McGhee talks about how racism has been a major obstacle in workers unionizing and argues for holding accountable those who sell racist ideas for profit rather than those who buy into them. Finally, she cites Lewiston, Maine, as an example of how diversity can be an asset to society, and calls for investing in all people and rejecting the old paradigm of zero-sum thinking.

In this section, the speaker shares how a surprising call-in to a public television live show led her to an important realization about systemic racism in America. She recounts how a man named Gary from North Carolina called in to say that he was prejudiced and wanted to change, spurring an unexpected and viral moment of compassion and open dialogue. This encounter led the speaker to question whether racism not only disadvantages people of color, but also backfires on the very people who benefit from white privilege. She argues that America's underinvestment in public goods, such as our schools, roads, and bridges, is just one example of how racism leads to bad policymaking and negatively affects everyone.

In this section, the speaker describes the devastating effects that racism had on public goods during the Civil Rights era. The examples shown emphasized that desegregation orders led to towns shutting down public facilities rather than integrate them. Racism isn't just damaging socially, but it is also financially burdensome, as seen in the 2008 financial crisis that cost trillions in lost wealth and jobs. The stereotype that people who were affected were buying properties they could not afford only made it harder for policymakers to address the issue before it was too late: the borrowers weren't the problem, the loans were. McGhee believes that the financial crisis would have never occurred if it weren't for the rampant discrimination of black and brown Middle-class communities being sold "risky" loans.

In this section, the speaker talks about her visit to Mississippi, and how racism served as a major obstacle in auto factory workers unionizing. The workers were fighting for better wages, healthcare benefits, and pensions, which would have benefitted all employees at the plant. However, she heard several prejudiced statements regarding the union and the idea that uplifting Black people would "down" white people. The union vote eventually failed, and workers are still struggling to gain higher wages and better healthcare coverage. The speaker calls for holding accountable those who sell racist ideas for profit rather than those who buy into them. On a more positive note, the speaker visited Lewiston, Maine, a dying mill town that has been revitalized by predominantly Black, Muslim immigrants and refugees. Together with longtime white residents, they built a community and created jobs, demonstrating how diversity can be an asset to society. The speaker argues that it is time to reject the old paradigm of zero-sum thinking and realize that our fates are linked, calling for the nation to invest in all of its people.
