The author discusses the idea that economic progress should take a particular shape - namely, that economies should grow in order to thrive, not just grow. The author points to the 1960 classic "The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto" by W.W. Rostow as evidence of this concept. Rostow argued that all economies must pass through five stages of growth in order to reach maturity. We are currently in the fifth stage, which is characterized by high-mass consumption. The author argues that we are addicted to growth, and that this addiction is harmful both economically and politically.

In the 21st century, humanity faces a number of challenges, including the need to meet the needs of all people within the means of the planet while avoiding overshoot of planetary boundaries. This is where 20th century economics failed, leading to policies that have caused global ecological collapse and economic inequality. In order to address these challenges, a new type of economics is needed that is based on principles of dynamic balance between the foundation and the ceiling. This picture, called the "well-being selfie," was created by the speaker as a way of illustrating this concept.

In her video, Kate Raworth discusses the shortcomings of the current economy, which is based on the growth of GDP. She argues that we need to create economies that tackle this shortfall and overshoot together, by design. Raworth lists a variety of examples of regenerative and distributive design that are already in practice, and suggests that we can achieve even more by implementing these concepts into our current economy. She concludes by suggesting that if we are to achieve a healthy economy, we need to break away from the dependence on GDP growth.
