The speaker highlights examples of playful, interesting messages, elegant writing styles, and drawings, including ones that give a glimpse into the lives of those rarely mentioned in the historical record, such as enslaved people.

In this section, we learn about the messages preserved through the graffiti of ancient Pompeii, which were a result of the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. Latin graffiti offer insight into the everyday lives of common Romans and their thoughts that would have been otherwise ignored in literature. Modern-day graffiti is typically associated with spray-painted illegal messages, but ancient graffiti were acceptable to write in homes, public spaces, and even tombs. The Pompeiians used graffiti as a form of communication when other writing tools were not readily accessible, which suggest that may have been an effective substitute for paper.

In this section, the speaker talks about her research on Pompii's perishable graffiti pieces and how they have been ignored by modern-day scholars. The graffiti on the Pompii's gate and the bathhouse shows how Pompeiians used to take an interest in writing and producing beautiful pieces of art. The speaker also highlights some of the playful, interesting messages like the alphabet written backward and forwards, which shows the playfulness of Roman graffiti. The speech also takes the listener on a virtual walk around ancient Pompeii and its graffiti, suggesting that these graffiti were the equivalent of the tweets and Snapchat stories of our time.

In this section, the speaker examines several examples of graffiti found in Pompeii, including the use of interpuncts to show word breaks, drawings of animals and gladiators possibly created by children or adults, a message from Secundus to Prima accentuated with a box, and elegant writing styles such as "Veneria, goodbye" with letters made to look like branches. The speaker also highlights a graffito that mentions the enslaved, specifically Amianthus, who was a clothes washer, allowing a glimpse into the lives of those who are often left out of the historical record.

In this section, the speaker reflects on the final graffito found in Pompeii, which reads, "On September 3, Satura was here." She notes that leaving one's mark in history is a timeless urge, but cautions against writing graffiti. Instead, the speaker encourages the audience to consider what messages they are leaving behind for future generations.
