# Summary of Larry Brilliant: TED Prize wish: Help stop the next pandemic

Larry Brilliant, a physician and epidemiologist, shares his experiences with fighting smallpox and eradicating it, highlighting the importance of early detection and response in controlling pandemics. He discusses the progress made in eradicating diseases such as smallpox and polio and talks about the potential risk of a bird flu pandemic. He emphasizes the need for an international early-warning system, called INSTEDD, to prevent pandemics and other catastrophes. The system would build on GPHIN, a web-crawling system that detects diseases early and is publicly available. By increasing the number of websites and languages crawled and adding outbound confirmation messages and satellite confirmation, the system could create a community of people committed to preventing pandemics and other disasters.

In this section, Larry Brilliant shares his experiences seeing the last case of smallpox and possibly the last case of polio in the world. He talks about his unconventional journey in medicine, including working with Native Americans and playing a doctor in a movie. He also shares photos and the story of the eradication of smallpox, emphasizing the importance of early detection and early response in controlling pandemics. He concludes with a reminder that we are all connected and that pandemics do not discriminate based on status or wealth.

In this section, Larry Brilliant talks about his experience eradicating smallpox in India in 1974. He shows a picture of a boy with smallpox and explains how they used it to find every case of the disease and control it. They made one billion house calls and had a spike in the number of cases reported every time they did a house-to-house search. He emphasizes the importance of surveillance systems for early detection and response. Ultimately, they were successful in eradicating smallpox, and he notes that it was the largest campaign in United Nations history until the Iraq war.

In this section, Larry Brilliant talks about the progress in eradicating certain diseases, such as smallpox and polio, and how early detection and response is key to their eradication. He also discusses the work of the Seva Foundation, specifically their focus on addressing the issue of blindness and how epidemiological surveys have helped with early detection and response to combat the issue. Brilliant then delves into the risk of a potential bird flu pandemic and emphasizes the importance of early detection and response to prevent or mitigate it. He shares the concerning statistics from a study he conducted with top epidemiologists, where 90% of them predicted a pandemic would occur within the lifetime of our grandchildren and a billion people could become sick with up to 165 million deaths.

In this section, Larry Brilliant talks about the potential global impact of a pandemic on the economy and the importance of implementing an early-warning system. He shows a simulation of how fast a disease can spread and describes how if we had early detection and early response, it would be possible to contain and ultimately prevent a pandemic. He praises GPHIN for its ability to detect SARS early and explains how an early-warning system is necessary to prevent humanity's worst nightmares. Therefore, his TED wish is to build an early-warning system, which he describes as the International System for Total Early Disease Detection (INSTEDD).

In this section, Larry Brilliant discusses his vision for an early detection system that can detect and contain pandemics and other catastrophes before they spread. He suggests building on GPHIN, a web-crawling system that already detected and reported SARS before the World Health Organization. He envisions a system that is freely available to anyone, transparent, non-governmental, and not owned by any single country or company. He proposes increasing the websites crawled from 20,000 to 20 million and increasing the languages crawled from seven to 70, or more. He also suggests adding outbound confirmation messages, using text messages or SMS to find out if rumors are valid, and satellite confirmation. He hopes that by pulling together the unique skills of this community, they can be proud of stopping pandemics and other catastrophes and changing the world beginning right now.

In this section, Larry Brilliant discusses the potential for using web crawlers to find diseases early and prevent pandemics. He believes that by adding more languages to the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) and making it open to everybody, health officers around the world will have equal access to information about potential pandemics. Brilliant also emphasizes the importance of creating a community of people who are watching out for the worst nightmares of humanity and making the information accessible to everyone.
