Rory Sutherland discusses the idea that large organizations, including government, have become disconnected with what actually matters to people. He gives the example of a hotel in Stockholm that has a lift with buttons that say "Garage," "Funk," and "Rhythm and Blues." The lift also has music buttons that let guests choose their lift music.

Rory Sutherland discusses the concept of "terminal 5 syndrome" and how it relates to the way we view and solve problems in the world. He gives the example of how a simple suggestion- such as making "Tell me my balance" the default rather than an option- could save people money and increase online banking usage. He argues that we live in a world that science can understand, but that business and government prefer a world where things are mechanistically proportional and where large expenses are justified by large returns.
