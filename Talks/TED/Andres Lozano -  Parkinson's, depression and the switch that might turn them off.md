# Summary of Andres Lozano: Parkinson's, depression and the switch that might turn them off

Neurosurgeon Andres Lozano explains how deep brain stimulation (DBS) can be used to alleviate the symptoms of various neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, depression, dystonia, and even cognitive deficits. With the use of implanted electrodes in the brain, doctors can adjust the electrical activity in specific brain areas through a remote control, helping patients regain lost movement, improve cognitive function and memory, and overcome glucose utilization deficits. Lozano stresses the importance of multidisciplinary work for understanding and treating complex brain conditions and predicts that continued research will lead to more breakthroughs in the field.

In this section, Andres Lozano, a neurosurgeon, explains that neurosurgery has been around for 7,000 years, and through time, scientists have been able to pinpoint where disturbances in the brain activity occur, leading to disorders such as Parkinson's disease, depression, and Alzheimer's. Lozano and his team have been able to implant electrodes into the brains of patients and adjust how much electricity is delivered to specific brain areas through a remote control, all with deep brain stimulation. Lozano then shows a video of a patient with Parkinson's disease, who has electrodes in her brain, and demonstrates how the electrodes improve symptoms of tremors when they are turned on.

In this section, Lozano discusses the case of a young boy with dystonia who at the age of six started twisting his body until he couldn't walk, stand, and had difficulty breathing. Lozano used the same area in the boy's brain that was suppressed in Parkinson's disease, with hopes of suppressing the boy's symptoms as well. After the procedure, the boy could stand and walk again, restoring his movement and everyday life, and he now even leads quite a normal life. Lozano then discusses how he took on the controversial issue of depression, a prevalent problem with treatments limited to psychotherapy, medication and electroconvulsive therapy. Lozano explains how by placing electrodes in the sadness center of the brain (area 25) and essentially turning down the activity, he could help those suffering from depression.

In this section, Dr. Andres Lozano discusses how deep brain stimulation (DBS) can be used to improve memory and cognitive function in patients with cognitive deficits, specifically those with Alzheimer's disease. By placing electrodes within the circuits that regulate memory and cognitive function, researchers hope to turn up their activity and help patients with Alzheimer's disease overcome the glucose utilization deficit that occurs when certain areas of the brain shut down. Clinical trials are currently underway, and researchers hope that DBS can be used not only to modify symptoms of various diseases but also help repair damaged areas of the brain.

In this section, Dr. Andres Lozano emphasizes the multidisciplinary work involved in studying the brain and addressing neurological disorders such as Parkinson's and depression. He acknowledges the importance of collaboration between engineers, imaging scientists, doctors, and researchers in order to fully understand and treat these complex conditions. Dr. Lozano predicts that continued research will lead to even more breakthroughs in the field and ultimately benefit patients in need.
