# Summary of James B. Glattfelder: Who controls the world?

In the video "James B. Glattfelder: Who controls the world?" the speaker discusses the limitations of traditional economic and financial models and the importance of understanding complex systems using the science of complexity. Glattfelder explains how his study on ownership networks of transnational corporations found a small but dominant core of shareholders who control a large proportion of operating revenue and have the potential to control 80% of the TNCs' value. He notes that this extreme level of control and interconnectivity could pose a significant systemic risk to the global economy and hopes that a complexity perspective can help find common ground in understanding our networked world.

In this section, the speaker discusses the limitations of existing economic and financial models that became apparent during the crisis and how oversimplified economics may have contributed to the crisis. He suggests that we understand more about the fabric of reality than the fabric that emerges from our human interactions. The speaker introduces the science of complexity, which studies complex systems made up of many interconnected parts such as financial markets, ecosystems, and ant colonies. Complex systems are hard to map into mathematical equations, but understanding their interactions and emergent behaviors can lead to a better understanding of the whole system. Networks are ideal for representing complex systems, and complex networks have been successfully applied to many fields.

In this section, James B. Glattfelder explains the importance of studying ownership networks to understand the distribution of control in economic systems, and the implications for systemic risk. He discusses the methodology of his study, which looked at ownership networks of transnational corporations and found a structured system, with a small but dominant core that controls a large proportion of operating revenue. He also explains how ownership gives voting rights to shareholders, which is the normal notion of control, and how the network and relative distribution of shares can amplify this control lever.

In this section, Glattfelder explains how his study computed the control over the TNCs' value, assigning a degree of influence to each shareholder based on Max Weber's idea of potential power. The study found that the top 737 shareholders collectively have the potential to control 80% of the TNCs' value, and the top 146 core players could control 40%. This extreme level of control and interconnectivity could pose a significant systemic risk to the global economy. Glattfelder notes that the TNC network's structure is an emergent property and probably not the result of a global conspiracy. He hopes that a complexity perspective can help find common ground in understanding our networked world and alleviate the gridlock created by conflicting ideologies.
