# Summary of Adam Grant: What frogs in hot water can teach us about thinking again | TED

In his TED Talk, Adam Grant highlights the importance of rethinking and avoiding being trapped by our goals, identities, and habits, like a frog boiling slowly in a pot of water. Grant emphasizes that being smart doesn't necessarily equate to being good at rethinking and that we can become trapped by "I'm not biased" bias. He urges people to embrace rethinking as a cultural value, which involves surrendering control, being open to reconsideration, and continually improving oneself. He encourages people to surround themselves with differing ideas and listen to criticisms to become better leaders. Overall, Grant emphasizes the significance of being willing to change one's mind and jump out of comfort zones when required.

In this section, the speaker talks about how humans can suffer the same fate as frogs being boiled in a pot of water - not recognizing the dangers building up in our environment until it's too late. Often, we stick to our goals, identities and habits, refusing to rethink our situation, which can be disastrous in a world that's rapidly changing. The speaker emphasizes that being smart doesn't necessarily help you rethink, and sometimes intelligence can trap us, making us worse at rethinking. This is known as the "I'm not biased" bias, where you always find reasons to convince yourself you're on the right path. The speaker gives an example of a time he and his friends were climbing a mountain in Panama, and despite taking more time than expected, they refused to rethink their decisions and eventually found themselves stranded with no resources. The speaker calls for people to rethink their situations and not let perseverance become stubbornness.

In this section, Adam Grant talks about how our goals and identities can trap us into having tunnel vision, instead of giving us a broad outlook. Grant talks about how he was obsessed with diving in college, but after realizing that he was only afraid of rethinking his identity, he started to explore other facets of his personality. Grant turned to magic, and his mentor's advice about unleashing his inner magician led him to become a successful professor. However, sometimes the routines we develop to help ourselves can become the ruts in which we can become trapped.

In this section, Adam Grant discusses how he coped with receiving negative feedback from his students and how he learned to become a better teacher by being open to rethinking. By surrendering control and ceding power to his students, he discovered how much his students had to offer and how he could become a better teacher by being willing to revise what and how he taught. He also emphasizes the importance of rethinking and how it does not necessarily mean changing one's mind, but rather taking time to reflect and staying open to reconsidering. Furthermore, Grant argues that we should embrace rethinking as a cultural value and create environments that invite and model it to improve ourselves continually. By being confident in our strengths and acknowledging our weaknesses, we can become better versions of ourselves, overcome our limitations, and engage with criticism to become stronger leaders.

In this section, the speaker emphasizes the importance of being open to changing one's mind instead of stubbornly sticking to one's conclusions. He encourages listening to ideas that challenge one's thought process and surrounding oneself with people who do the same. He also tells the story of the frog in the slow-boiling pot, which he notes is a myth since the frog would actually jump out when the water gets too hot. However, the point remains that we need to be ready to rethink and jump out of our comfort zones when necessary.
