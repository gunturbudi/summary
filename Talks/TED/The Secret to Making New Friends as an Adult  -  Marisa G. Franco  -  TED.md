In this talk, Marisa Franco discusses the research on in-person connections being stronger than virtual connections, and the importance of practicing the same skills in offline connections to establish deeper relationships. She shares an excerpt from her book in which she discusses the concept of "super friends." Super friends are secure with themselves and are more likely to initiate friendships, maintain friendships, and be less likely to dissolve friendships. They are also more responsive to the needs of other people, and when they engage in conflict, it's all about perspective-taking.
