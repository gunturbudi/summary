# Summary of Why we get mad -- and why it's healthy | Ryan Martin

Ryan Martin, an anger researcher, explains that anger is a healthy and universal emotion. It tells us when our goals are blocked and can motivate us to take action to improve our lives and relationships. Anger is not solely caused by provocative events, but rather by an individual's interpretation of the event within their life context. While chronic anger can be associated with irrational thoughts, being angry due to mistreatment and unfairness is justifiable. Anger alerts us to injustice, and we can channel it into something positive and productive, such as protesting, volunteering, or creating art.

In this section, Ryan Martin, an anger researcher, explains that anger is a universal emotion that is powerful and healthy in our lives. From the first few months of life, we've all been feeling it when we didn't get what we wanted. Furthermore, he explains that the reason we get mad is because our goals are blocked, it feels unfair, we get negative situations, and because of frustration. People see anger as bad, seeing that it interferes in their life or damages relationships, and it's scary. However, Ryan Martin believes that anger is a good thing because it gives us information about how we feel and when we need to act to change our environment, experiences, and relationships for the better.

In this section, Ryan Martin talks about the factors that contribute to anger. He states that anger is not caused by the provocations alone, but by an individual's interpretation of that provocation and how it fits into their life's context. When people undergo primary and secondary appraisal, they evaluate the event in terms of its blame, punishment, fairness and punishment, as well as how bad it is. Martin exemplifies driving as the perfect environment for anger to emerge due to the perceived loss of control. Furthermore, he points out the thought processes associated with chronic anger, including catastrophizing, misattributing causation, overgeneralizing, demandingness, and inflammatory labeling. He concludes that while these thoughts can be irrational, sometimes they are rational, and being angry due to mistreatment and unfairness is justifiable.

In this section, the speaker explains that anger is an evolutionary advantage and alerts us to injustice. When we get angry, our sympathetic nervous system kicks in, giving us energy to respond to the injustice. However, physically fighting isn’t a reasonable or appropriate way of dealing with anger anymore, and we have the capacity to regulate our emotions and channel anger into something more productive. Anger can motivate us to respond to injustice and we can fight by protesting, writing letters, volunteering for causes, creating art, literature, poetry, music, or a community that cares for others. So the next time we get angry, we should listen to what it’s telling us and channel it into something positive and productive.
