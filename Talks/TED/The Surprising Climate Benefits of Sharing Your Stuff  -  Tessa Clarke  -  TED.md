# Summary of The Surprising Climate Benefits of Sharing Your Stuff | Tessa Clarke | TED

In a TED talk, Tessa Clarke discusses the environmental impact of food waste and highlights the benefits of the sharing economy. Clarke emphasizes that reducing food waste is the most powerful lever humanity has to solve the climate crisis and created the app Olio to connect people with their local community to give away excess food instead of throwing it away. Since launching in 2015, Olio has gained over 6 million users who have shared 66 million portions of food, resulting in an environmental impact equivalent to taking 200 million car miles off the road and saving over 10 billion liters of water. Clarke hopes the movement towards a sharing economy will continue to grow and sets an ambitious goal for Olio to have 1 billion consumers by 2030.

In this section, Tessa Clarke explains that household consumption is responsible for 65% of all greenhouse gas emissions, and wasting food is one of the most significant contributors. One-third of all produced food is thrown away, resulting in devastating environmental impacts because a landmass larger than China is used every year to produce food that ends up wasted, including deforested land and degraded soil, and it is responsible for methane emissions that are 25 times more deadly than carbon dioxide. Clarke highlights that reducing food waste is the most powerful lever that humanity has to solve the climate crisis based on an analysis by Project Drawdown, a collaborative piece of work by several hundred of the world's leading climate change scientists. Clarke created Olio, an app that connects people with their local community, allowing people to give away, rather than throw away, their spare food.

In this section, the speaker discusses the environmental impact of sharing perfectly good food instead of throwing it away, which has led to zero food waste locations for businesses. Since its launch in 2015, the sharing platform has gained over 6 million users who have shared 66 million portions of food, resulting in an environmental impact equivalent to taking 200 million car miles off the road and saving over 10 billion liters of water. However, the speaker emphasizes that sharing can also have a social impact, creating connections and strengthening communities, and can contribute to solving our overconsumption problem more broadly. The speaker suggests that sharing instead of shopping needs to become the default, and the platform has expanded to include giving away unwanted household items.

In this section, Tessa Clarke highlights the benefits of sharing economy companies such as Olio, which allows communities to lend and borrow goods instead of buying new ones. Clarke expresses hope in the movement towards a sharing economy, believing that small actions by individuals can accumulate to have a significant impact on the climate crisis. She sets an ambitious goal for Olio to have 1 billion consumers by 2030, emphasizing the importance of taking action to combat climate change.
