# Summary of Gavin Schmidt: The emergent patterns of climate change

Gavin Schmidt discusses the challenge of understanding the complex and interconnected patterns of evidence on climate change. He explains how climate models aim to simulate different emergent patterns in the climate system and how events like volcanic eruptions and deforestation affect these patterns. Schmidt provides examples of how models have been successful in modeling past events and how they can help us ask more complex questions in the future. The choices we make for the future, such as mitigating carbon emissions or doing nothing, cannot be answered by models alone. What we do with information from models is up to us.

In this section, Gavin Schmidt discusses how the patterns of evidence on climate change are complex and dynamical, ranging over a wide variety of scales. The challenge of understanding these patterns is immense and cannot be achieved using reductionism, as the patterns are interconnected and can't be split into smaller sections. Climate models aim to encapsulate the different equations, fluxes, and processes that give rise to different emergent patterns in the climate system, from the growth and melting of sea ice to the formation and dissipation of clouds. These models are around a million lines of code, and their capability to simulate the patterns of the climate system is increasing at a rate of one extra order of magnitude every decade.

In this section, Gavin Schmidt discusses how kicking the system, or changing the climate through various events such as volcanic eruptions, deforestation, or even contrails, affects the emergent properties of climate change. He explains that models are skillful approximations that allow us to evaluate our understanding of the system and make predictions. Schmidt provides various examples of how models have been successful in modeling past events such as ice sheets or volcanic eruptions and how it can help us ask more complex questions in the future. The combination of different factors that affect climate change can be seen across the world, and answering these questions leads to a better understanding of how climate and air pollution coexist, and how we can change things that affect them both.

In this section, Gavin Schmidt explains that we can see the patterns of global warming in observations and in the model. However, there are choices to be made for the future as there is uncertainty. We can mitigate the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, do more to bring it down, or leave it to fate with a business-as-usual attitude. The differences between choices can't be answered by looking at models, and what we do with information from models is up to us.
