# Summary of The real reason why mosquitoes buzz | DIY Neuroscience, a TED series

Haley Smith explains in the TED video "The real reason why mosquitoes buzz" how she captures and records male and female mosquitoes to study their courting behavior. Male mosquitoes generate higher frequency buzzing sounds than females, but when they come together, they change their frequency to match and sing a duet, indicating that they have found a potential mate. Female mosquitoes tend to choose the male who sings her duet the best. A better understanding of mosquito mating behavior could potentially help prevent diseases like malaria.

In this section, Haley Smith, a researcher, explains how she captures and records male and female mosquitoes in order to understand their courting behavior. Haley uses a petri dish of ice and superglue to tether and record the wingbeats of the mosquitoes. Their buzzing sound is generated by how fast they beat their wings, and males generate a much higher frequency than females. However, when males and females come together, they change their frequency to match and sing a duet, indicating that they have found a potential mate. The female mosquito tends to choose the male that best sings her duet, and if she's already pregnant, she doesn't bother. Understanding mosquito mating behavior may prevent diseases like malaria.
