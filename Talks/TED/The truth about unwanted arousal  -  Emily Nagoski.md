Nagoski emphasizes the importance of acknowledging that physical responses are not indicative of consent or enjoyment and encourages having brave conversations about the issue. Finally, she stresses the importance of allowing oneself to explore and embrace desires as long as all parties are consenting and free to leave at any time.

In this section, Emily Nagoski discusses how there are three intertwined but separable systems in the brain that are referred to as the "reward center". These systems dictate liking, wanting, and learning; all of which play into our emotions and connections to things, including sex. The research shows that even if someone is physiologically responding to sex-related stimuli, there may not be a predictive relationship between the subjective experience of pleasure and desire. In fact, the predictive relationship between genital response and subjective experience is anywhere between 10 and 50 percent.

In this section, Nagoski discusses how genital behavior doesn't necessarily predict an individual's subjective experience of liking or wanting, and this is known as arousal nonconcordance. This is illustrated through the stories of people experiencing different levels of arousal during sexual encounters where one party's genital behavior didn't correlate with their actual feelings. Further, Nagoski stresses that it's important to listen to explicit verbal cues of consent and pleasure, rather than inferring it based on body language alone, which could be gaslighting in some cases. Finally, she warns against the belief that orgasms indicate consent and sexually motivated behavior, citing a court case where the defense tried to use orgasms to prove the victim's consent.
