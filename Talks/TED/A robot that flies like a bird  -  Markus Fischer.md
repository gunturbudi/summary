# Summary of A robot that flies like a bird | Markus Fischer

Markus Fischer, from Festo Corporation, presents the SmartBird, an ultra-light indoor flying model inspired by the herring gull, at a TEDGlobal conference. He discusses the importance of creating lightweight and energy-efficient structures, with a focus on pneumatic and airflow phenomena. The SmartBird, made entirely from carbon fiber and weighing only 450 grams, moves using a split wing to achieve lift and propulsion. Fischer explains the challenges of coordinating its movement and improving its aerodynamic efficiency. He emphasizes the importance of regulating a robot's aerodynamic efficiency to reduce energy consumption, and notes that the SmartBird uses only 25 watts of energy at takeoff and 16 to 18 watts during flight. The audience is impressed and requests to see the bird in action again.

In this section, Markus Fischer talks about how he and his team at Festo Corporation designed an ultralight indoor-flying model called the SmartBird, taking inspiration from the herring gull, which flies solely by flapping its wings. Fischer explains the importance of making lightweight structures that are energy-efficient, and how they incorporated pneumatics and air flow phenomena into their design process. He then demonstrates the SmartBird, which has a wingspan of two meters, weighs only 450 grams, and is made entirely out of carbon fiber. Fischer explains the challenges of coordinating the bird's movement, using a split wing to achieve lift and propulsion, and how they measured and improved its aerodynamic efficiency.

In this section, Markus Fischer discusses the importance of controlling and regulating the aerodynamic efficiency of a robot in order to minimize its overall consumption of energy. He notes that the robot he has developed uses only around 25 watts of energy at takeoff and 16 to 18 watts during flight. The audience is impressed and requests to see the robot fly again, which is met with cheers and applause.
