In this section, Becci Manson talks about the hand-cleaning process required for the restoration of water-damaged photos. She explains that a local woman helped her team in hand-cleaning the photos, as it is very easy to do more damage to the already damaged pictures. Manson mentions that the lady who had brought them the photos had started hand-cleaning the photos by herself, but then realized she was doing more damage, and she had duplicates. Manson reveals that as most of the photos were damaged by salty water, bacteria, sewage, and oil, they needed to be cleaned before being retouched, which was a huge part of the project. With the help of 1100 volunteers, hundreds of whom had helped them hand-clean more than 135,000 photographs, they were able to restore the majority of the photos, giving back a small piece of humanity to the tsunami survivors.
