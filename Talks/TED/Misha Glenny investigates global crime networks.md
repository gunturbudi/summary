In this section, the speaker discusses the growth of the Global Shadow Economy, also known as McMafia, citing the collapse of communism as a major factor. When communism fell in Eastern Europe, the state also collapsed, leaving a vacuum in the police and court systems. As a result, people turned to privatized law enforcement agencies, which were essentially the mafia, to ensure their contracts were honored. Additionally, many people who were sacked from their jobs in the security services joined the mafia, despite the fact that they had skills in surveillance, smuggling, building underground networks, and killing people.

In this section, Misha Glenny discusses how he traveled the world to investigate the global criminal underworld, talking with law enforcement, victims, and gangsters themselves. He notes that organized crime in a globalizing world operates like any other business, with zones of production, distribution, and consumption. Glenny describes how the Balkans became a transit zone for illicit goods and services like heroin, cocaine, and trafficked women heading to the European Union. He then highlights the violent conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo due to mafias cooperating with paramilitaries to seize valuable mineral resources. Glenny concludes by showing how duty-not-paid cigarettes were smuggled into the E.U., demonstrating the vast resources available to criminal groups, and emphasizes the primary driver of international organized crime is Western desire to consume.

In this section, Misha Glenny discusses how the liberalization of international financial markets during globalization has made it easy for money launderers to operate. The offshore banking network is an essential part of this money laundering, and getting rid of them is necessary to combat illegal tax evasion and transnational organized crime. However, licit banks were also accepting deposits from dubious sources, so effective regulation is needed. Glenny highlights the case of Bernie Madoff, who stole $65 billion from people for decades in Wall Street, and argues that there are likely other Madoffs around, fleecing ordinary people and engaging in money laundering. Glenny also discusses the expansion of the global narcotics market during globalization and the shift of production of synthetic drugs from the developing world to the Western world, which is set to overwhelm policing capacity in the West.

In this section, Misha Glenny explains how organized crime has shifted its operations to focus on counterfeit goods and cybercrime, which have been highly successful. Cybercrime is driven more by social engineering than the technology itself and promises of sex and love can be used to make people perform actions on their computers that are not in their best interest. Additionally, Glenny explains how organized crime impacts all areas of our lives and creates instability and violence wherever it goes, such as the creation of low-quality counterfeit drugs that can develop resistance to effective treatments. Therefore, it is essential to take organized crime seriously as it is a significant economic force.
