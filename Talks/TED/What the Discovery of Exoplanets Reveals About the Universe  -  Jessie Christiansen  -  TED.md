# Summary of What the Discovery of Exoplanets Reveals About the Universe | Jessie Christiansen | TED

Jessie Christiansen shares her experience in planet hunting, stating that the discovery of 5000 exoplanets is just the beginning of our understanding of space. These planets have been categorized and studied in order to answer questions about how planets are formed and what kind of planets exist in our Milky Way. Researchers hope to find a planet similar to Earth that could support life, and NASA is studying the possibility of building a large telescope that would allow for an actual photograph of these planets to be taken. Christiansen expresses her hope to be a part of that mission.

In this section, Jessie Christiansen describes her journey of planet hunting and how the discovery of 5000 exoplanets is just the beginning of our understanding of space. By categorizing and studying these planets, we can start to answer big questions about how planets are formed and what kind of planets exist in our Milky Way. With no two planets being the same, we've discovered evaporating, disintegrating, ultra-puffy, and ultra-dense planets as well as super-Earths, which are twice as big and ten times as heavy as our Earth. With continued research, we can map the timeline of planetary development and understand the chaos that takes place to form boulders and eventually planetesimals.

In this section, Jessie Christiansen discusses the possibility of finding planets that are similar to Earth and the efforts NASA is making to do so. Through the study of exoplanets, researchers hope to find solid, warm planets with water oceans and sandy shores which could potentially harbor life. NASA has been studying the idea of building a large telescope in space that would allow for an actual photograph of these planets to be taken and searched for biomarkers indicating the presence of life. Christiansen expresses her hope to be a part of that mission.
