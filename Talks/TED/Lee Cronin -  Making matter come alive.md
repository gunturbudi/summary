# Summary of Lee Cronin: Making matter come alive

Lee Cronin discusses his quest to turn inorganic, dead matter into living matter or inorganic biology in this YouTube video. He explains that the minimal unit of matter that can undergo Darwinian evolution is a single cell and talks about examples of inorganic life, such as a dead crystal that he brings to life through chemical experiments. Cronin believes that the emergence of the first cells was as probable as the emergence of the stars and that inorganic matter could pose a "matterhazard" if it were to replicate. He proposes creating an inorganic Lego kit of molecules to understand the origin of life and states that introducing evolution into the material world could lead to technology advancement and a general theory of evolution that could control the sophistication of matter in the universe. Furthermore, he believes that if matter can evolve, it is alive, and there could be non-carbon-based life on other planets.

In this section, Lee Cronin discusses his quest to turn inorganic, dead matter into living matter, or inorganic biology. He starts by asking what the minimal unit of matter that can undergo Darwinian evolution is and realizes that it is a single cell. He shows examples of inorganic life, such as a dead crystal that he brings to life through chemistry experiments and explains that inorganic matter could pose a "matterhazard" if it were to replicate. He believes that the emergence of the first cells was as probable as the emergence of the stars and that the physics of life may be encoded into the universe just as the physics of fusion is. Lastly, he depicts a complicated diagram of pathways in the cell to examine what life is characterized by.

In this section, Lee Cronin discusses the challenge of creating artificial or understanding the origin of life, since life's beginning occurred in a "vast chemical soup of stuff." Scientists have two options: intelligent design or the emergence of chemical complexity, with the latter being the most likely. To create inorganic life, Cronin's laboratory uses various reaction formats, with a focus on aggregating simple inorganic molecules together to create diversity required for complex information storage that can compete and evolve. The key ingredients include metabolism, energy, information, and a container to enable evolution. Therefore, Cronin and his team seek to create an inorganic Lego kit of molecules to understand the origin of life.

In this section, Lee Cronin discusses how his lab was able to create cells from molecules, and how encouraging these molecules to compete and talk to each other could lead to a self-sustaining artificial life form. He proposes that if evolution could be introduced into the material world, it could lead to a general theory of evolution that could potentially control the sophistication of matter in the universe. This could also lead to new technologies and a reorganization of how we design things. Cronin believes that matter that can evolve is alive and that making evolvable matter could potentially define life. He also suggests that there could be non-carbon-based life on other planets.
