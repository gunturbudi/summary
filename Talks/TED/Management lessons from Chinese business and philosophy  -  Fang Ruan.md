Fang Ruan discusses the management lessons learned from Chinese business and philosophy, specifically from the founders of Dumpling Xi. Gāo De Fu created a two-hat model in which successful regional heads took on a second role at headquarters while still being frontline managers, which helped the company recover from a strong growth period. While most Chinese entrepreneurs are good at growth strategies, Gāo's approach of having tolerance for frontline managers to make mistakes and having some new ideas not coming from the top is not common in China. This allows for a more dynamic and adaptable company in an ever-changing business environment.
