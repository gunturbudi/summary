# Summary of Are Video Calls the Best We Can Do in the Age of the Metaverse? | Josephine Eyre | TED

In a TED talk, Josephine Eyre argues that video calls do not foster creativity and problem-solving capabilities in remote teams. Instead, she suggests turning to the metaverse, an evolving concept of virtual reality that provides new creative and interactive spaces for people to engage with one another. Eyre emphasizes the "three magic I's" of immersion, interaction, and imagination that are key drivers of creative collaboration and encourages people to think creatively when designing virtual environments. She notes that immersive technology can promote collaboration and trust but highlights the need for conscious and deliberate creation of a metaverse that aligns with our values and goals.

In this section, Josephine Eyre discusses the problems posed by video calls to teams' creativity and problem-solving capability. She argues that our reliance on video calls for communication during remote work is misplaced, as they do not represent the natural, 3D environments that our brains are wired to be creative in. Video calls commodify communication in a way that distracts from the creative process, and we should explore other options rather than relying only on what has become the norm. Eyre suggests that we turn to the metaverse, an emerging concept of virtual reality that offers new ways of communicating and interacting, fostering creativity, and innovation.

She notes that virtual reality is one of the most powerful technologies that can be used to access these spaces and believes that it will reignite workplace creativity and inspire people to achieve the impossible. The speaker also talks about the "three magic I's," which are immersion, interaction, and imagination, and how they are key drivers of creative collaboration. She explains that VR gives us the ability to do anything and be anywhere, regardless of whether it exists in reality or not, and encourages people to think creatively when designing virtual environments instead of relying on existing paradigms.

In this section, Josephine Eyre discusses how we know that traditional corporate spaces are not conducive to creative collaboration and highlights that retreats, nature, messiness, and even colors can help in inducing divergent thinking. She also emphasizes the importance of using immersive technology in the present as a tool to promote collaboration and trust, as organizations are already providing VR headsets to their employees. However, she highlights the potential negative impact of the metaverse and urges leaders to become conscious and deliberate creators of their own destinies to create the kind of future they want to see.
