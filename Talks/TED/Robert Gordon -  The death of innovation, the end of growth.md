# Summary of Robert Gordon: The death of innovation, the end of growth

Robert Gordon argues in his YouTube video that the current period of American economic growth is likely to end soon. He attributes this to several factors including demographics, education, and debt. Gordon suggests that if innovation continues to be as powerful as it has been in the last 150 years, growth is cut in half. However, if innovation is less powerful, Americans in the future cannot expect to be twice as well off as their parents.
