In this section, sleep researcher Wendy Troxel discusses the consequences of sleep loss among American teenagers due to schools starting too early. Only about one in 10 teens get the recommended eight to 10 hours of sleep per night, and this chronic sleep deprivation could lead to moodiness, irritability, laziness, and depression. Teenagers have a delay in their biological clock, so waking them up at 6AM is equivalent to waking an adult at 4AM. This could result in teens seeking out large amounts of caffeine to compensate for their lack of sleep. Advocates of sleep-friendly start times suggest that healthy sleep habits during adolescence could lead to positive impacts on their developing brains, including better judgement and problem-solving skills.

In this section, Wendy Troxel discusses the negative effects of sleep-deprived teenagers. Teenagers who don't get enough sleep are more likely to experience a lack of concentration, which leads to issues with attention and behavioral disorders. Furthermore, sleep deprivation can lead to higher rates of depression, suicide and substance use amongst adolescents. It also has a detrimental impact on their physical health, which includes an increased risk of developing health concerns later on in life. Additionally, teenagers who are sleep-deprived are more likely to engage in dangerous activities such as driving, which puts their own and others' lives at risk. Longer school start times have been shown to have long-term academic and health benefits for teenagers.
