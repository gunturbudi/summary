# Summary of Science didn't understand my kids' rare disease until I decided to study it | Sharon Terry

Sharon Terry shares the story of how she and her husband discovered that their children had a rare genetic disorder known as Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum (PXE). She found that there was little understanding of the disease and no systematic effort to understand it. This led the couple to establish PXE International, a nonprofit that collected resources for study. They later established a laboratory at Harvard that found the gene, patented it, and created a diagnostic test. Terry eventually joined Genetic Alliance and led the organization, which established networks of health advocacy, patient advocacy, research, and health organizations that built scalable and extensible resources like biobanks and registries for all diseases. She emphasizes the need to dissolve boundaries and work without the "us versus them" mentality that often exists between organizations and individuals. Sharon invites everyone to embrace vulnerability and recognize that the inner and outer work are interconnected, achieving limitless accomplishments together.

In this section, Sharon Terry shares the story of how she and her husband Pat discovered that their children had Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum (PXE), a rare genetic disorder that had little understood about it at the time. Despite being told by the doctors that there was nothing to worry about, Sharon's intuition led her to take her daughter to a dermatologist who discovered the condition. This discovery led Sharon and Pat on a journey of educating themselves about PXE as they realized that there was no systematic effort to understand the disorder, and researchers were competing with each other rather than sharing information to alleviate suffering.

In this section, Sharon Terry describes the barriers she and her husband faced when they decided to initiate research on a rare disease that affected their children. The couple had no science background and found that researchers traditionally do not share information, leading them to establish PXE International, a nonprofit that collected resources from around 100-150 people globally for study. They later established a laboratory at Harvard and found the gene, patented it, and created a diagnostic test. Through their journey, they faced fears about the disease, losing hope in the progress, and fearing that researchers would not help them find solutions. Sharon Terry eventually joined Genetic Alliance and led the organization, which established networks of health advocacy, patient advocacy, research, and health organizations that built scalable and extensible resources like biobanks and registries for all diseases. She believes that people should be partners in research, and the answers to many health problems lie in donations from individuals to provide data, biological samples, and ultimately themselves.

In this section, Sharon Terry talks about the importance of recognizing that people should be at the center of healthcare systems, and how Genetic Alliance has experimented with transforming these systems. She emphasizes the need to work without boundaries and to dissolve the "us versus them" mentality that often exists between organizations and individuals. Sharon also discusses how facing one's fears and embracing vulnerability can lead to discovering boundless capacity for love and finding paths to practical solutions as well as to the core of healing and health. She invites everyone to turn towards fear, embrace vulnerability, and realize the inner and outer work are interconnected, thereby achieving limitless accomplishments together.
