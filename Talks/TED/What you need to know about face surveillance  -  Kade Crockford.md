# Summary of What you need to know about face surveillance | Kade Crockford

In this video, Kade Crockford argues against the idea that privacy is irrelevant by noting how technologies like encryption and curtains advance both safety and privacy. She warns that face recognition technology used for surveillance can create a digital panopticon cataloging public movements, habits, and associations, posing a significant threat to key rights. She highlights the lack of accountability for government use of this technology and advocates for municipal bans on its use.

In this section, the speaker challenges the myth that privacy is dead and that people do not care about it as long as they have nothing to hide. Privacy, according to the speaker, is not secrecy but control. Technologies like encryption software, curtains, door locks, and fences advance both safety and privacy, whereas dragnet surveillance protects neither. Face surveillance is the most dangerous technology that can be used for face recognition and surveillance to create a digital panopticon, creating records of people's public movements, habits, and associations. Privacy is the guarantor of safety, and it is essential to raise awareness to prevent panopticon-like surveillance from becoming widespread.

In this section, the dangers of face surveillance are outlined. The nature of facial recognition technology enables a pervasive form of surveillance that has never been possible before. Every individual's public movements, habits and associations would be documented and catalogued, posing a significant threat to freedom of speech, religion, privacy and other key rights. The second primary concern is how to regulate the technology since it lacks accountability mechanisms to prevent abuse in the hands of the government. As a result, tech companies like Microsoft and Google, along with the ACLU, have called for caution and a nationwide campaign to slow down the adoption of this type of surveillance.

In this section, Kade Crockford highlights the potential inability to restrict the government's use of face surveillance technology. Unlike other forms of surveillance such as tracking phone records, face surveillance does not require the government to obtain warrants and can therefore operate without limitations or privacy safeguards. The lack of a warrant requirement poses a significant threat to everyone’s right to privacy, and the only alternative is to deny the government’s ability to build these in-house face-surveillance networks. Organizations like the ACLU are advocating for municipal bans on this technology's use, pressing for a safer and freer future for us all.
