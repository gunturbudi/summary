Mental illnesses are among the leading causes of disability around the world. Depression, for example, is the third-leading cause of disability, alongside conditions such as diarrhea and pneumonia in children. Global health experts are concerned about the treatment gaps for mental illnesses, with approximately 50% of those affected not receiving the interventions they need. Mental health professionals are in short supply, and many people affected by mental illnesses experience abuse and discrimination in their everyday lives.
