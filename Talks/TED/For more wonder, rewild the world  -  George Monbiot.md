# Summary of For more wonder, rewild the world | George Monbiot

In this video, George Monbiot explores the concept of "rewilding", which involves the mass restoration of ecosystems by reintroducing missing plants and animals and allowing natural processes to occur without intervention. Monbiot discusses trophic cascades and gives the example of how wolves reintroduced into Yellowstone National Park changed the behavior of rivers and stabilized the land. He also argues for the potential of rewilding human life by reintroducing lost megafauna or closely related species, leading to a richer and wilder life of adventure for humans. Monbiot believes that rewilding offers the possibility for ecological change to not necessarily proceed in a negative direction, ushering in a new era of possibilities for the environment.

In this section, the speaker shares his personal experience of feeling ecologically bored after returning from a wild adventure in the tropics and realizing how the scope of his existence was gradually diminishing in the comfortable and safe life of the industrialized world. He introduces the concept of "rewilding," which has two fascinating definitions - one being the mass restoration of ecosystems, where he talks about trophic cascades and how the reintroduction of wolves in the Yellowstone National Park had a remarkable impact, leading to the regeneration of vegetation, increase in migratory birds, and number of beavers due to creating niches for other species.

In this section, Monbiot discusses the concept of trophic cascades and how the removal of large animals in ecosystems can drastically change its composition. He gives the example of how wolves reintroduced into Yellowstone National Park not only affected the populations of animals like elk and rabbits but also changed the behavior of rivers and stabilized the land. Similarly, whales in the southern oceans are important for sustaining ecosystems and absorbing carbon emissions from the atmosphere. Monbiot argues that rewilding means bringing back missing plants and animals and allowing natural processes to occur without intervention.

In this section, Monbiot discusses the potential for rewilding human life and the return of certain megafauna, or giant animals, to ecosystems across the world. He notes the opportunities for rewilding, as large areas of land are vacated by farmers in Europe and reforested in the United States. He suggests that reintroducing lost megafauna or closely related species could lead to a richer and wilder life of adventure for humans, offering hope and motivation to love and defend the natural world. Monbiot believes that rewilding offers the possibility for ecological change to not necessarily proceed in a negative direction, ushering in a new era of possibilities for the environment where summer replaces the silent spring.
