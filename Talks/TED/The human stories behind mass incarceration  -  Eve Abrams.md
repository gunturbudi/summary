# Summary of The human stories behind mass incarceration | Eve Abrams

Eve Abrams shares stories of families impacted by mass incarceration, including a mother whose innocent son is serving a 30-year sentence for manslaughter while the former district attorney who pressured witnesses has been charged with corruption. She draws attention to the disproportionate impact on African American children's mental health, education, and poverty, given they are more likely to have a parent in prison. She discusses how biases and assumptions within the criminal justice system cause over-representation of black people in prisons, and states society has a responsibility to question the system, including politicians' tendency to pass harsh laws and allocate resources to imprison people. Finally, she notes the importance of adequate funding for government-appointed attorneys who represent the majority of legally charged citizens.

In this section, Eve Abrams tells the story of Sheila Phipps, whose son McKinley served 17 years of a 30-year sentence for a manslaughter charge he was innocent of. McKinley was convicted on the basis of unreliable eyewitness testimonies made under pressure from the district attorney, who later stepped down due to corruption charges. Despite this, McKinley is still in prison. Estimates reveal that around 87,000 people, mothers, fathers, and sons, are locked up for crimes they did not commit, while another half a million are presumed innocent but are kept in jail as they cannot afford bail. This story, along with the disproportionate targeting of people of color in the criminal legal system, teaches us the importance of understanding and teaching the younger generations about the judicial system.

In this section, Eve Abrams discusses the impact of mass incarceration on families, particularly young people. Children with parents in prison are more likely to struggle with emotional and behavioral issues, educational problems, and poverty. This is disproportionately affecting African American children, who are much more likely to have a parent in prison. Abrams also brings attention to the overrepresentation of black people in the justice system, which is clear from the demographics of who waits to see the judge. Finally, she asks whose responsibility it is to question the assumptions and biases within the criminal justice system.

In this section, the speaker highlights the responsibility that society has over the criminal legal system, especially when it comes to the mass incarceration issue. She notes that politicians tend to pass harsh legislation and allocate significant resources to locking people up, even without adequate evidence, due to public demand for swift retribution. Additionally, she points out that prosecutors decide whether or not to pursue legal action and the severity of the charges filed, which can significantly impact the defendant's sentence. Furthermore, she mentions that the majority of defendants in the country are represented by government-appointed attorneys who receive significantly lower funding than district attorneys, who work to ensure that justice is brought to the citizens even when the system is heavily weighed against them.
