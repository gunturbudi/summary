Aris Venetikidis describes how a schematic diagram, or public transport map, is designed differently than a street map. The schematic diagram is designed in the language of the brain, and it omits less important information while simplifying the geography. Beck's London Underground map, which is considered the pinnacle of schematic diagram design, is not designed by a cartographer or city planner, but by an engineering draftsman. The success of the subway map is in the lack of important information and in the extreme simplification.
