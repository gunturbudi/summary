# Summary of The hidden role informal caregivers play in health care | Scott Williams

Scott Williams stresses the crucial yet often overlooked role informal caregivers play in healthcare systems worldwide. These caregivers provide personal, medical, and emotional support to patients and contribute significantly to society, as demonstrated by a 2015 study which showed that informal caregivers of people with mental illness in Australia provided a value of nearly twice what the government spends on mental health services annually. Williams notes that without adequate support, caregivers can experience severe physical, financial, and psychosocial stress, risking their own health and well-being. He emphasizes the need for societal and structural change to recognize the importance of caregivers and suggests individuals can play a role by offering help to caregivers or volunteering to be a caregiver for a few hours a week.

In this section, the speaker emphasizes the crucial role played by carers in the healthcare system, and how they are an invisible backbone to these systems all over the world. As the demands on family caregivers increase, it is important to recognize their value to patients, the healthcare system and society. Carers perform a range of duties, including personal care, medical care, and emotional support. However, the challenges they face cannot be ignored, and carers often sacrifice their own physical, financial, and psychosocial well-being. Without adequate support, they can be stretched to the breaking point.

In this section, Scott Williams highlights the importance of informal caregivers, who provide 80% of care across Europe, and the significant value they bring to our societies as demonstrated by an example from Australia in 2015 where the annual value provided by informal caregivers to those suffering from mental illness was evaluated at 13.2 billion Australian dollars, nearly two times what the Australian government spends on mental health services annually. Williams emphasizes that if carers were to stop caring tomorrow, our health and social systems would crumble. He also explains the personal challenges faced by carers including financial difficulties and sacrificing their own health and well-being and relationships. While there has been some improvement in recognizing carers, societal and structural change is needed to truly put the care back into healthcare. Williams suggests that individuals can start this change by embracing a carer, thanking them, offering help or volunteering to be a carer for a few hours a week.
