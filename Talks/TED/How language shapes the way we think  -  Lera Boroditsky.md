# Summary of How language shapes the way we think | Lera Boroditsky

The YouTube video "How language shapes the way we think | Lera Boroditsky" discusses research that suggests that language shapes the way we think. The video features clips of people from different languages speaking and thinking in ways that differ from those of speakers of English. For example, people from languages that don't use left and right might orient themselves using cardinal directions rather than left to right, and people from languages with a writing direction opposite to English might think in reverse chronological order. These differences in thinking and orienting oneself are pronounced across cultures.
