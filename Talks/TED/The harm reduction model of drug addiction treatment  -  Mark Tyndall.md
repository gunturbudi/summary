# Summary of The harm reduction model of drug addiction treatment | Mark Tyndall

The harm reduction model of drug addiction treatment is based on the belief that drug use can be reduced or eliminated without criminal punishment. This model has been successful in Portugal, where drug use has decreased, overdose rates have decreased, and more people are in treatment. The video urges the United States to adopt this model as an alternative to current drug policies.

Detail Summary:

The harm reduction model of drug addiction treatment is based on the premise that drug use can be harmful, but that it is not always necessary or desirable to seek treatment or abstinence. Harm reduction interventions, such as providing clean needles and safe spaces to inject drugs, are seen as a way to help people recover from addiction without having to give up using drugs entirely. Some critics of harm reduction argue that it gives the wrong message to children about drug users, while others claim that it doesn't work and is a waste of money. However, harm reduction interventions have been shown to be more effective than abstinence-only programs in preventing HIV and death from drug use, and they are more humane than enforcement-only approaches.
