In this section, Dan Ariely tells a story about a physician who guilt-tripped him into undergoing an unnecessary surgery. The physician was trying to use him as the third patient for a paper they were writing on a new tattooing procedure. Ariely declined and discovered the guilt trip came from a conflict of interest as they had already performed the procedure on two other patients, and they needed one more to complete their paper. Ariely also shares a story about a research experiment where they almost threw a drunk participant out of the test group, but after deliberating, they decided not to remove him, and the results demonstrated how conflicts of interest can blind us to reality. He cautions that we need to learn to recognize these incentives that others may have and how they affect us to prevent falling prey to these behaviors.
