# Summary of Tom Wujec: Got a wicked problem? First, tell me how you make toast

Tom Wujec discusses his work in visualizing systems, and how it can be used to solve problems more effectively. He provides examples of how this approach has worked in the past, and how it can be applied to more complex challenges.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Tom Wujec discusses the design exercise of making toast, which can be simplified into a diagram with nodes for tangible objects (toaster, bread, people) and links between them. This exercise can help people understand and solve complex problems. The exercise has three parts: first, drawing the diagram without words; second, adding sticky notes or cards to the drawing; and third, reworking the diagram with the help of others. The complexity of the drawings increases as the number of nodes increases, but the model becomes clearer with each iteration. This process of rapid iteration is essential for clarity in design.
