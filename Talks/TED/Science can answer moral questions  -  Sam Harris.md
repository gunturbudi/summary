In this video, Sam Harris discusses the idea of the moral landscape, which is a way of understanding morality as objective and based on the well-being of conscious creatures. He argues that morality is not relative, and that we can make progress on moral issues by understanding the brain and how it affects our views on these issues.

He then goes on to talk about food and how there are many right answers to the question of what is food, despite the fact that there are many different types of food.
