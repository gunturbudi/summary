# Summary of A Creator-Led Internet, Built on Blockchain | Adam Mosserri | TED

Adam Mosseri discusses the shift in power from established gatekeepers to individuals with the advancement of technology, which has led to the emergence of platform giants like Instagram. He predicts that a shift in power will occur towards creators who own their relationship with their audience and turn their passion into a living, with platforms like Instagram needing to shift their role to support and empower creators. Mosseri explains that web3 technologies, such as blockchain, offer the opportunity for creators to establish direct financial relationships with their audience, independent of any platform. Additionally, he highlights the challenges of the current financial infrastructure for creators to borrow money to fund their ideas, advocating for investing in people by selling equity in their future using smart contracts that codify the terms. Mosseri believes that this model allows creators to own their relationship with their audience and that blockchain technology will create a world where anyone with a compelling idea can turn their passion into a living.

In this section, Adam Mosseri discusses the shift in power from established gatekeepers to individuals that has occurred throughout history with the advancement of technology, beginning with the printing press. While the internet initially accomplished its goal of putting power in the hands of the people and weakening gatekeepers, a new establishment of platform giants like Instagram emerged, leading to an unexpected concentration of power. Mosseri predicts that over the next decade, a shift in power will occur towards creators who own their relationship with their audience and turn their passion into a living. Platforms like Instagram need to shift their role to support and empower creators and hand over more power to them, which Mosseri believes will ultimately be best for both creators and the platform itself.

In this section, Adam Mosseri discusses web3 and the potential it brings for creators. Mosseri explains that web3 technologies, such as blockchain, offer the opportunity for creators to establish direct financial relationships with their audience, independent of any platform. By using a blockchain-based membership card, creators like Lisa, a hypothetical country artist, can have subscribers who can follow them across various platforms, without being bound solely to a specific platform's rules. Furthermore, by using blockchain technology, no company can ever take away Lisa's community and relationship with her subscribers, and she will maintain her income even if a platform disappears overnight. However, the volatility of technology means that there will be new challenges in the future.

In this section, Mosseri highlights the challenges of the current financial infrastructure for creators to borrow money to fund their ideas. He advocates for investing in people, just as we do with start-ups, by selling equity in their future using smart contracts that codify the terms. By connecting revenue share, merchandise sales, and subscription fees to one token, any audience member can buy a share and build equity in the creator they trust, who in turn benefits from more funds to explore and create. Mosseri believes that this model allows creators to own their relationship with their audience and that the blockchain technology supporting it will create a world where anyone with a compelling idea can turn their passion into a living, marking the greatest transfer of power from institutions to individuals in history.
