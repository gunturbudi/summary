# Summary of Feats of memory anyone can do | Joshua Foer

In this video, Joshua Foer discusses the art of memory, which he learned about while covering the United States Memory Championship. He met people who were not natural prodigies but had trained themselves to perform miraculous memory feats using techniques invented in ancient Greece that were later used by Cicero to memorize speeches. Foer took on the challenge of memory training himself and ended up winning the contest, concluding that great memories are learned, and good memory depends on paying attention and being deeply engaged. He emphasizes that there are incredible memory capacities in all of us, but we have to be the kind of person who remembers to remember if we want to live a memorable life.

In this section, the speaker describes his experience covering the United States Memory Championship, expecting to see people who are natural prodigies, but instead encountering “average” people who have trained themselves to perform miraculous memory feats. The speaker learns that these people use techniques that were invented in ancient Greece and that Cicero used to memorize his speeches. The speaker meets Ed Cook, a competitor from England, who is determined to teach Britney Spears how to memorize the order of a shuffled deck of playing cards on national television because it will prove that anyone can do it. The speaker decides to take on the challenge himself and embarks on a year-long journey of memory training and investigation.

In this section, the speaker discusses his interest in understanding memory and meeting individuals on opposite ends of the memory spectrum - E.P., an amnesic with the worst memory in the world, and Kim Peek, the inspiration for the character in the movie 'Rain Man'. He read memory treatises and realized the historical value of a trained and cultivated memory which has changed due to externalizing memory with technology. Memory contests gave an insight into why memory champions have structurally different brains and how they use spatial memory to light up different parts of the brain. They use elaborative encoding and have an arsenal of techniques that come down to this concept, including the 'Baker/baker paradox.'

In this section, Joshua Foer explains how the art of remembering, which is critical in memory contests, is about finding ways to transform information that lacks context, meaning, and significance so that it becomes meaningful to remember relative to other information in an individual's memory. He highlights one of the oldest techniques, the "memory palace," which involves creating an imagined house filled with vivid and unusual images to store what an individual wants to recall later. Foer explains that ancient orators used this technique to remember speeches word-for-word, and it is a tool we can all utilize in everyday life to remember to-do lists or any other important information.

In this section of the video, Joshua Foer talks about the subculture of competitive memorizers whom he has observed and studied. He wanted to write about these people, but found that the events themselves were rather boring. So, he started to train his memory himself and ended up winning the contest. Foer explains that great memories are learned, and good memory depends on paying attention and being deeply engaged. Memory techniques work because they force a kind of mindfulness and depth of processing that most people don't normally exercise. Foer leaves the audience wondering how much they are willing to lose from their already short lives by not paying attention and processing deeply.
