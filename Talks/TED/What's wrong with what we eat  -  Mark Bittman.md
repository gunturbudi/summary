# Summary of What's wrong with what we eat | Mark Bittman

In a video titled "What's wrong with what we eat," Mark Bittman discusses the harm caused by livestock consumption and the Western diet on the environment and human health. He highlights that livestock is the second biggest contributor to climate-altering gases and is responsible for air, water, and land pollution, water scarcity, loss of biodiversity, and misuse of antibiotics. Bittman argues that the Western diet contributes to an increase in lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and some cancers. He also points out issues with the food pyramid and the locavore trend, examines the evolution of convenience in the American food industry, and questions the viability of organic food as a solution to unhealthy diets. Bittman emphasizes the need to advocate for a better diet for everyone that involves reducing meat intake and increasing plant consumption.

In this section, Mark Bittman discusses the impact of the consumption of meat and the Western diet on the environment and human health. He highlights the fact that after energy production, livestock is the second-highest contributor to atmosphere-altering gases and that livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation, air and water pollution, water shortages, loss of biodiversity, and the overuse of antibiotics. He argues that the Western diet, which includes meat, dairy, and refined carbohydrates, is responsible for the increase in lifestyle diseases like diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and some cancers. Bittman also points out that the overconsumption of animals, junk food, and the paltry consumption of plants is the problem that has been marketed heavily, creating unnatural demand, and supported by the government agencies at the expense of a more health- and Earth-friendly diet.

In this section, Mark Bittman talks about the flaws of the food pyramid and how it wasn't specific enough about the types of carbs we should consume instead of just promoting general healthy eating. He also addresses the issues with the locavore trend only benefitting those who have access to locally grown food. Bittman discusses how the United States went from a country where everyone was essentially a locavore to a society where fresh food traveled long distances, leading to the rise of processed and packaged foods. This change contributed to the growth in industrial animal farming and ultimately the death of family farms.

In this section, Mark Bittman explores the evolution of convenience in the American food industry, from canned and frozen foods marketed to housewives in the mid-twentieth century to the present-day emphasis on fast food and value-added products crammed with soy and corn products. Bittman observes that, while the quality of home cooking declined, industrial food production became the norm, and many people became fat-phobic or obsessed with miraculous health foods such as broccoli or yogurt; diets grew increasingly standardized while the variety of available fresh fruits and vegetables shrunk. Bittman notes that this began to change in the 70s, as people became more interested in local and organic foods, leading the way for change.

In this section, Mark Bittman questions whether organic food is truly the solution to our problems relating to the an unhealthy diet, and the answer might not be so clear-cut. He says that farm-raised salmon cannot be organic as it is not fed on a natural diet, rather a supposedly organic one, whilst being packed tightly in pens, swimming in filth, before being flown 5,000 miles to the United States. Issues around global survival and overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food pose greater danger to people and the environment in comparison to the amount of greenhouse gases produced which is 18%, and livestock production needs 70% of the agricultural land on Earth. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce meat intake and increase the consumption of plants which would be achievable if we advocate for a better diet for everyone.
