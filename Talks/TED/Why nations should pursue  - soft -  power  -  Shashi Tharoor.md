In this section, Shashi Tharoor explores the concept of soft power, the ability of a country to attract others because of its culture, political values, and foreign policies. Tharoor argues that soft power is a combination of various factors, including the power of example and cultural attraction, which can be more convincing than hard power like military strength, nuclear capacity, or economy. In the present age of ever-evolving technology and media, countries with access to multiple channels of communication and information have an edge in creating soft power. India, for example, has become an astonishingly connected country with the world's largest telephone market, 509 million cellphones in Indian hands, which can contribute significantly to the country's soft power.

In this section, Shashi Tharoor describes how connectivity in India has brought empowerment to the underclass, as exemplified by the widespread use of cell phones, which have saved farmers and small business owners time and money. He also discusses how India's soft power is spreading through Bollywood films, which showcase Indian culture and are popular in countries not traditionally associated with Indian influence. Tharoor also notes the impact of Indian soap operas on Afghan audiences, which led to a temporary reduction in crime during their air time. Overall, he argues that India's soft power is a valuable asset in international relations and should be cultivated further through investment in the entertainment industry and other cultural exports.

In this section, Shashi Tharoor discusses the importance of soft power and tells the story of India's changing image around the world. He highlights how India's political pluralism has played an important role in shaping the country's story and how it has become a land of mathematical geniuses, computer wizards, and software gurus. Furthermore, Tharoor mentions India's open society and how it has been a welcoming home for different religions and ethnicities over the millennia. He concludes that governments aren't very good at telling stories, and people see a society for what it is, which is ultimately what makes a difference in today's information era.

In this section, Shashi Tharoor talks about the concept of nationalism in India. He explains that India's nationalism is based on an idea rather than geography or ethnicity. This ideology aims to unite people of diverse backgrounds by rallying around the concept of pluralist democracy, where differences of caste, creed, color, and culture do not divide the nation. Tharoor highlights that India's success lies in maintaining a consensus on how to survive without consensus, and overcoming poverty and developmental challenges while striving to liberate and fulfill the creative energies of its people. He concludes by asserting that India and TED share a common ground in their open and diverse societies, making India a fitting addition to the TED community.
