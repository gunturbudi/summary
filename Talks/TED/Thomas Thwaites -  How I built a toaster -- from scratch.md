# Summary of Thomas Thwaites: How I built a toaster -- from scratch

Thomas Thwaites attempts to make an electric toaster from scratch using materials such as steel, mica, plastic, copper, and nickel, and he faces many challenges, such as sourcing iron ore and learning the process of making steel. Despite these obstacles, he presses on with the help of professors and the internet, determined to make a toaster without prior knowledge or tools. Thwaites talks about how he obtained copper, mica, and plastic and admits that although the final toaster failed due to poor insulation, he still considers his experiment a partial success, as he created something basic from raw, natural materials.

In this section, Thomas Thwaites talks about his motivation for the Toaster Project, which was inspired by the quote from Douglas Adams' book, “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.” Thwaites attempts to make an electric toaster from scratch using materials such as steel, mica, plastic, copper, and nickel, and he faces many challenges, such as sourcing iron ore and learning the process of making steel. Along the way, he realizes that working on a small scale often requires going further back in time. Despite these obstacles, he presses on with the help of professors and the internet, determined to make a toaster without prior knowledge or tools.

In this section, Thomas Thwaites discusses how he obtained copper and mica, which were necessary for creating the pins of his metal electric plug, and for insulating electricity respectively. He then talks about his difficulties in obtaining oil-derived plastic, a defining feature of cheap electrical goods, as BP declined his request. A failed attempt at creating potato starch plastic led him to look to modern-day rock, thinking that synthetic polymers like plastics would be embedded in it. He visited a recycling company, Axion Recycling, which dealt with electronic waste, to acquire plastic. The section ends with a picture of the completed toaster, without its case.

In this section, Thomas Thwaites talks about the results of his toaster experiment, which involved creating a toaster entirely from scratch. He admits that while his homemade creation did manage to toast bread for about five seconds, it ultimately failed due to the poor insulation of the wires, causing damage to the element. Nonetheless, Thwaites still considers his endeavor a partial success, given that he was able to create something basic from raw, natural materials.
