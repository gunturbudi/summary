Josh Giegel explains how the hyperloop, a futuristic transit system, works. The system is based on the concept of a "smart vehicle, dumb road" - smart pods that travel in a passive tube, while the road remains the same. Giegel and his team had to come up with a vision for the hyperloop that was both feasible and safe, and they succeeded. While the project may be "insane" at first, it is now one step closer to becoming a reality.
