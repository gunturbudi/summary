# Summary of The lie that invented racism | John Biewen

John Biewen reflects on the origin of racism, tracing it back to a lie invented by a Portuguese man, Zurara, who asserted the inferiority of Africans. Biewen claims that this lie became a tool of the slave trade, which benefited from justifications for the brutal exploitation of African people. He explains that whiteness and blackness were created by Zurara and requires each other to have any meaning, and as such, racism is a tool used to divide people and prop up systems that benefit some and disadvantage others. The burden of solving racism, Biewen argues, rests on white people, who are implicated in a system that privileges them, and he emphasizes the need to transform unjust institutions and support conversations around reparations.

In this section of the video, the speaker discusses the issue of racism and how it's often only viewed from a surface level by the media. He explains that reporting on racial issues typically means pointing cameras and microphones at people of color and asking them how they're doing or how they feel, rather than focusing on the root of the problem. He also talks about how he was raised to believe that racists were bad people and how he was able to disconnect from the reality of racism because he grew up in a predominantly white area in Minnesota. However, with the rise of more publicized occurrences of racial injustices, the speaker has been forced to reevaluate his understanding of racism and confront the systemic racism that plagues American society.

In this section, John Biewen reflects on whiteness and how it is a relatively recent invention compared to the long-standing history of tribal, religious, and linguistic divides. He highlights that, for most of human history, people had no notion of race and that ancient Greek people only thought they were better because they had developed the most sophisticated culture. Biewen also notes that slavery, despite being present for centuries, was not about race but instead, people enslaved those who did not look like them, or even those who did. Finally, he identifies the first articulation of racist ideas, which he found in a book written in the 1450s by a Portuguese man named Gomes de Zurara, who should be more famous, or infamous, for laying the foundations of what we now call racism.

In this section, John Biewen explains the origins of racism, which he claims started with a lie invented by a Portuguese royal chronicler, Zurara. According to Biewen, this lie about the inferiority of Africans became a tool for the lucrative slave trade, which required justifications for the brutal exploitation of African people. Moreover, he outlines that whiteness and blackness were created by Zurara, requiring one another to have any meaning. Ultimately, Biewen argues that racism is a tool to divide us and prop up systems that benefit some people and disadvantage others, revealing that it's not solely an issue of individual bigotry, but rather something more systemic.

In this section, John Biewen discusses how racism was invented by white people to advantage themselves and how it's the responsibility of white people to solve it. He talks about how he used to think of racism as a struggle for people of color to fight, but now understands how white people are implicated in the system that advantages them. He emphasizes that this isn't about guilt or shame, but about a stronger sense of responsibility to take action and supports conversations about reparations and finding ways to transform unjust institutions. Biewen believes that wherever we show up, we need to show up with humility, vulnerability, and a willingness to put down the power that we did not earn to create a society that is not built on the oppression of anyone.
