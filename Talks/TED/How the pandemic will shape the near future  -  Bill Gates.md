# Summary of How the pandemic will shape the near future | Bill Gates

In this video, Bill Gates discusses the potential scenarios for the remainder of the year with regards to the COVID-19 pandemic, warning that death rates could become worse than the worst of what we had in April as we get into the fall. He emphasizes the need for leadership in admitting that there is still a huge problem in opening up schools with numerous dimensions of inequity and the global cooperation required to combat the pandemic. Gates also discusses the need for increased philanthropy during the pandemic, especially for the developing world, where governments can't print checks to alleviate the economic suffering caused by the crisis.

In this section, Bill Gates discusses the potential scenarios for the remainder of the year with regards to the COVID-19 pandemic. Gates warns that as we get into the fall, death rates could become worse than the worst of what we had in April. He attributes this to the lack of distancing and behavior change seen in recent months, with the virus having gotten into many cities that it had not been in before. There is still no development in diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines that would fundamentally prevent the virus from spreading this fall. Gates urges people to take these predictions seriously, as the virus is somewhat seasonal, and the force of infection will be worse as we near fall.

In this section, Bill Gates discusses the alarming upticks in case rates in the United States, primarily in the South. Younger people have come out of mobility more than older people, resulting in a very young age structure which will work its way back into the elderly and push the death rate back up. In a well-functioning healthcare system, the current fatality numbers would be below 1% with the added help of innovative therapeutics such as the monoclonal antibodies which Gates is most excited about and we'll have more of in the fall. The transmission dynamics of the disease are more difficult than even the experts predicted, with asymptomatic spread accounting for around 40% of transmissions, particularly among those with high viral loads.

In this section, Bill Gates discusses how transmission of the coronavirus is disconnected from the amount of virus one has in their upper respiratory area. He goes on to talk about the worst-case scenario when it comes to spreading the virus, which is when someone has a lot of the virus in the upper respiratory tract but almost none in their lungs, so they're not seeking any care. Gates also mentions that identifying super-spreaders is difficult but important. When asked about the ethics of not wearing a mask on a plane, Gates says that it would be endangering others. The clip ends with Gates admitting that there has been some opening up too liberally, which has created more risk than benefit.

In this section, Bill Gates discusses the trade-offs involved with opening up schools during the pandemic. While there are huge benefits to letting kids go to school, it is difficult to weigh the risk, and there are many dimensions of inequity that the disease has made worse, such as job type and internet connection. Gates emphasizes the need for leadership in admitting that there is still a huge problem and not turning the issue into a political stance. He believes that innovation tools are where the Gates Foundation has the most expertise, particularly in terms of antibodies and vaccines. He would coordinate these efforts with governments and companies to choose which products deserve the resources, as there is no market signal for that. Gates also discusses how Dr. Fauci has become a wise voice on this issue, but the CDC should be the primary voice.

00:20:00
In this section, Bill Gates discusses the early potential vaccines for COVID-19, including Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson and Johnson. While these vaccines are currently in the animal testing and human trial phases, Gates remains cautiously optimistic about their eventual success. In the meantime, his foundation and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness are working to ensure that manufacturing capacity is available for the best potential vaccines so that poorer countries are not left without access. Gates recognizes that his foundation's expertise and coordination skills make it possible to guide this process effectively.

In this section, Bill Gates discusses the need for global cooperation to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. While the US has contributed significant funds to vaccine research, there has been a lack of involvement in helping poorer countries overcome the pandemic, which will likely suffer a higher number of deaths and negative effects. Gates notes that the world has come to expect the US to take a leadership role in addressing global health problems, and the absence of such leadership has made it challenging to coordinate efforts against the pandemic. Gates also identifies Germany as having effectively used monitoring of oxygen saturation levels to detect severe cases early on, while doctors have improved treatment practices and found that ventilators are often overused.

00:30:00
In this section, Bill Gates is asked about the conspiracy theories surrounding him and the pandemic, which have resulted in millions of Facebook posts and a poll showing that 40% of Republicans believe that the vaccine he would roll out would implant a microchip to track individuals. Gates acknowledges the impact this misinformation can have on public faith in a vaccine, and is unsure of how to respond without giving credence to the theory. He is caught in a difficult situation and has received threats, but expresses hope that the truth will ultimately prevail. They call for anyone with suggestions on how to combat conspiracy theories and misinformation to come forward.

00:35:00
In this section, Bill Gates discusses the importance of staying isolated during the pandemic and reducing out-of-the-house contacts to minimize the risk of transmission. He further talks about the difficulty of effective philanthropy and the need to up the rate of philanthropic giving to causes that one connects to. He mentions the goal of The Giving Pledge and the Gates Foundation to help individuals find causes that they are passionate about and encourage more collaborative philanthropy efforts. He emphasizes the significance of scaling up giving for those with immense wealth and the importance of shaping and enjoying the impact of philanthropy.

00:40:00
In this section, Bill Gates discusses the need for increased philanthropy during the pandemic, especially for the developing world, where governments can't print checks to alleviate the economic suffering caused by the crisis. While governments may miss many needs, philanthropists have the opportunity to speed up the process and provide hope and progress to solve tough problems. Gates himself is considering increasing the rate at which he gives away his fortune, and believes that tech fortunes, in general, can also contribute to helping those in need.
