# Summary of What to Do When There's a Polar Bear in Your Backyard | Alysa McCall | TED

The speaker in this TED talk discusses the impact of climate change on polar bears and the resulting increase of human-polar bear encounters. Due to a loss of sea ice, polar bears are forced to search for food, including human garbage, leading to habits of human interaction and endangering their lives. The talk emphasizes the importance of coexisting with polar bears safely and reducing negative encounters. Successful efforts in waste management and innovative technologies for tracking bears that come too close to communities are presented as crucial tools, and education, awareness, and precautionary measures are encouraged. The talk concludes by stressing the importance of taking action to reduce carbon emissions to protect polar bear habitat and coexist safely with these predators.

In this section, the speaker discusses the impact of climate change on polar bears and how it affects their habitat leading to hunger and desperation for the bears, forcing them to search for food, including human garbage. The loss of sea ice directly affects the polar bears by making them landlocked, and while they can feed on other foods, human food's high-calorie density makes it very tempting for them. The presence of humans and their garbage increases the risk of bears becoming habituated to humans and being killed, leading to the importance of coexisting with these predators safely. Polar bear harvest is allowed under a quota system, and it is crucial to protect the rights of Indigenous peoples who practice traditions that may involve hunting polar bears.

In this section, the speaker discusses the importance of reducing negative human-polar bear encounters and providing non-lethal tools to protect both species. Churchill, Manitoba is highlighted as an example of successful waste management and coexistence efforts, with an indoor garbage dump and bear-resistant bins. Polar Bears International is working on innovative technologies, including GPS tracking and "burr on fur" tags, that could identify and track bears that come too close to communities, helping to reduce negative encounters. Education and awareness are also key tools, and people are urged to take precautions when entering bear territory, including carrying deterrents like bear spray. Finally, the speaker stresses the importance of reducing carbon emissions to protect polar bear habitat in the Arctic.

In this section, the speaker concludes her talk by emphasizing the importance of taking action to address climate change, as polar bears serve as an indicator species warning us to act now. She acknowledges her worries, but believes that taking action is the best antidote to anxiety. The speaker emphasizes the need for coexistence between humans and polar bears and urges us to work towards making it safe for both species.
