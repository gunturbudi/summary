# Summary of The human skills we need in an unpredictable world | Margaret Heffernan

In this video, Margaret Heffernan highlights the need for companies to prioritize being robust and prepared for the unpredictable future, rather than just efficient. To do so, businesses must develop relationships and alliances beforehand, adopt multiple solutions, and implement experimentation in the workplace. Heffernan emphasizes the importance of human skills such as preparedness, coalition-building, imagination, bravery, and experimentation, which technology is depriving us of. These skills are sources of strength and resilience needed in today's unpredictable age to create a successful path forward.

In this section, Margaret Heffernan discusses how the trend towards efficiency – which was traditionally important in business – is becoming less effective in today’s unpredictable world. Due to the prevalence of unpredictable events – such as sudden changes in social norms – techniques like standardized work schedules no longer work. Companies must instead value preparation for the unknown and prepare for multiple possibilities. To do this, organizations must develop relationships and alliances prior to any outbreak of events, which is an inefficient use of resources but ultimately more robust.

In this section, the speaker shares a story of a company's experiment called "Love Week" where employees must seek out and celebrate the skills and qualities of their counterparts. Although it takes a lot of time and effort, it energizes the business and boosts productivity. These kinds of messy and unpredictable skills such as preparedness, coalition-building, imagination, bravery, and experimentation are sources of strength and resilience that we need in today's unpredictable age. However, society's dependency on technology is depriving us of these skills. The more we outsource tasks to machines, the less we can think for ourselves and connect with people who are different from us. In times of stress and turbulence, it is not technology that will keep us going, but rather the support of our friends and colleagues.

Without these skills, we risk being lost in the constantly changing landscape of the future. However, by honing and developing these skills, we have the power to shape our own future.
