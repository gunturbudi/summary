# Summary of This country isn't just carbon neutral â€” it's carbon negative | Tshering Tobgay

Former Prime Minister of Bhutan, Tshering Tobgay, discusses Bhutan's unique approach to development, focusing on Gross National Happiness (GNH) rather than just Gross National Product (GNP). Bhutan is not only carbon-neutral, but carbon-negative due to their forests sequestering more carbon than the country generates, and their exports of renewable electricity offsetting up to 50 million tons of carbon dioxide a year. Despite this, Bhutan has been impacted by climate change, and Tobgay explains the measures the country is taking to remain carbon-neutral, including the Bhutan for Life initiative to raise funds to protect parks until the government can take over fully. Tobgay invites the audience to help carry their dreams beyond their borders to those who care about the planet's future.

In this section, Tshering Tobgay, the former Prime Minister of Bhutan, talks about his country's unique approach to development, which focuses on Gross National Happiness (GNH) rather than just Gross National Product (GNP). He explains that Bhutan has a small economy, but education and healthcare are completely free for all citizens, and the country's limited resources are used carefully to develop the country without harming their unique culture or pristine environment. He also proudly wears his national dress, the gho, which is worn by all men in Bhutan and represents their cultural heritage.

In this section, Tshering Tobgay explains that Bhutan is not only carbon neutral, but carbon negative. Bhutan's forests sequester more than three times the 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide generated by the entire country each year, making it a net carbon sink. Additionally, they export renewable electricity that offsets about six million tons of carbon dioxide in their neighbourhood and plan to increase their electricity exports to offset 17 million tons of carbon dioxide by 2020, potentially offsetting up to 50 million tons of carbon dioxide a year. Despite being a carbon-neutral and negative country, Bhutan has been impacted by climate change through glacier melting, leading to flash floods and landslides.

In this section, Bhutan's former Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay explains how they've promised to remain carbon-neutral for all time and how they intend to keep that promise through several measures the country is taking, such as providing free electricity to farmers, investing in sustainable transport and subsidizing the purchase of electric vehicles, subsidizing the cost of LED lights, and protecting Bhutan's national parks, nature reserves, and wildlife sanctuaries. Furthermore, Mr. Tobgay introduced Bhutan for Life, King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck's initiative, which is a fund that will enable Bhutan to remain carbon-neutral in the long term.

In this section, Tshering Tobgay introduces the Bhutan For Life initiative, which is a funding mechanism to look after and protect the parks of Bhutan until the government can take over fully. The initiative raises a transition fund from individual donors, corporations, and institutions, and is closed only after predetermined conditions are met and all funds committed. Individual donors can commit without having to worry about supporting an underfunded plan, as the goal is to protect parks until the government can increase their own funding gradually until the end of the 15-year period, after which the government guarantees full funding forever. Tobgay shares his excitement about their expected closure later this year and invites the audience to help carry dreams beyond their borders to all those who care about the planet's future.
