# Summary of Paul Collier: 4 ways to improve the lives of the "bottom bil

In this YouTube video, economist Paul Collier offers four ways to improve the lives of the bottom billion: aid, trade, security, and governments. He also discusses the potential for transformational development in the bottom billion through commodity booms, as well as the importance of good governance in these countries. Collier notes that democracies can make an even bigger mess of resource booms than autocracies, and proposes that international standards could help make reforms in these societies more effective. Finally, he highlights the importance of having an informed society to make better political decisions towards Africa.

In this section, Paul Collier discusses the need to provide credible hope for the bottom billion by combining two forces: compassion and enlightened self-interest. He draws on the example of how the rich world developed post-war Europe, tearing up their trade policy, reversing their security policy, and tearing up national sovereignty. Collier argues that these four interventions, aid, trade, security, and governments, are still effective policies for reversing economic divergence and promoting development.

In this section of the video, economist Paul Collier talks about how the commodity booms present an opportunity for transformational development in the bottom billion. He explains how new discoveries have led to a flow of resources and unprecedented amounts of money into many countries of the bottom billion. Collier also discusses his research on the relationship between higher commodity prices of exports and the growth of commodity-exporting countries, noting that good governance is a critical issue. He emphasizes that the long-term consequences for growth depend on the level of economic governance when the resource booms accrue and that the resource curse is entirely confined to countries below a threshold of governance, with Nigeria being an example of a country worse off than if it had never had oil.

In this section, Paul Collier discusses the adverse effects of democracy on governance in the bottom billion. While initially, he believed that the spread of democracy had transformed governance, he found that democracies make an even bigger mess of resource booms than autocracies. However, he notes that electoral competition is what causes the damage, whereas strong checks and balances make resource booms good. Therefore, what the countries of the bottom billion need are strong checks and balances, yet they don't have them. Collier proposes that international standards would be the way to go, as we have seen with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. International standards would help reformers in these societies achieve change and help them overcome the odds that are stacked against them.

In this section, Paul Collier emphasizes the importance of having an informed society in making effective political decisions towards Africa. He broke the rules of conduct for an economist and wrote an economics book that could be easily understood by the general public to build an informed citizenry. Collier pleads for ambassadors to be created who will be critical to passing on reliable information to other people.
