# Summary of 12 sustainable design ideas from nature | Janine Benyus

Janine Benyus, founder of the Biomimicry Institute, talks about using biomimicry to inspire sustainable design ideas. She shares examples such as engineers learning from seashells to solve scaling problems in pipes and using CO2 as a feedstock. Janine presents ideas for more efficient airplane wings, self-cleaning surfaces, and green chemistry practices for mining metals. She also emphasizes the importance of understanding the connection between natural adaptations and environmental responsibility and suggests farming practices based on how a prairie builds soil and wastewater treatment based on how a marsh cleans water. Ultimately, Janine urges us to find ways to meet our needs while making the world a better place.

In this section, Janine Benyus talks about how biomimicry is being used by architects, designers, and engineers in real-time design challenges to become inspired by nature. She describes a conversation with wastewater treatment engineers who were resistant to the idea of biomimicry, not understanding the difference between bioprocessing and learning an idea from an organism and applying it. Janine took them on a beach walk and picked up shells, demonstrating that scaling in pipes is just crystallization that happens automatically out of seawater. The engineers had never connected the fact that the same process for creating a seashell could apply to the scaling inside their pipes, providing an example of biomimicry integration.

In this section, Janine Benyus, a biologist and founder of the Biomimicry Institute, discusses how engineers have learned from natural organisms like shells to solve scaling problems in pipes. When examining how shells grow, it was discovered that an organic protein helped stop crystallization and engineers found an eco-friendly version called TPA that helped stop scaling in pipes. This revelation led to engineers realizing that there are numerous solutions already available in the natural world that they could learn from instead of trying to solve everything themselves. By learning how life makes things, makes the most of things, and makes things disappear into systems, we can redesign the human-made world with the natural world's guidance.

In this section, Janine Benyus talks about 12 sustainable design ideas inspired by nature, including self-assembly and bio-mineralization processes that could transform the manufacturing and IT industries. Self-assembling ceramics could be made at room temperature and used for hard materials or for solar cell assembly, while bio-mineralization silicon used in diatoms can mimic low-temperature structures to create perfect lenses. Another big idea is using CO2 as a feedstock, as plants already make starches and glucose out of the gas. The most exciting idea is mimicking the energy-harvesting device inside purple bacteria for solar transformations without using platinum, which could transform fuel cells. Finally, shape innovation, as seen in the tubercles on a whale's fins, can increase efficiency in design.

In this section, Janine Benyus presents several sustainable design ideas inspired by nature that could revolutionize the way we approach everything from air travel to water management. These ideas include creating more efficient airplane wings by mimicking the edge of a bird's wing, using thin-film interference to create color and self-cleaning surfaces, and developing new separation technologies and green chemistry practices to mine metals and reduce toxic chemicals. The timeliness of packaging and finding ways to keep vaccines safe without refrigeration are also examined. Perhaps most important, however, is understanding the connection between natural adaptations and environmental responsibility: everything these organisms do, they do with an eye toward ensuring the health of the planet that will support their offspring far into the future.

In this section, Janine Benyus shares the final three sustainable design ideas from nature. The eleventh idea is growing fertility, which suggests farming practices based on how a prairie builds soil, ranching practices based on how native ungulate herds increase the health of the range, and wastewater treatment based on how a marsh cleans water and creates productivity. The twelfth idea is the secret trick of life: creating conditions conducive to life, which includes building soil, cleaning air, and mixing the gases needed for life. Janine emphasizes that we need to find ways to meet our needs while making the world a better place.
