# Summary of Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger? | David Epstein

David Epstein explores the factors that have contributed to the improvement of athletic performance over time. Technology has played an important role, with synthetic tracks allowing athletes to run faster, and smarter training methods improving technique. However, artificial selection of body types has also played a role in improving athletic performance, with coaches recognizing the need for specialized bodies for different sports. The evolution of sports media has also allowed access to elite performance, while a change in athlete mindset has also led to athletes pushing themselves to reach their full potential. Overall, a combination of factors has contributed to athletes becoming faster, better, and stronger.

In this section of the video, David Epstein examines the progress of athletic performance over the years. He begins by comparing the winner of the 2012 Olympic marathon to the winner of the 1904 Olympic marathon and notes that the former would have won by nearly an hour and a half. While it may seem like humans have evolved into a new species over the last century, Epstein explains that technology has made a major difference in athletic performance. For instance, Jesse Owens was 14 feet behind the current world champion in the 100 meters, but biomechanical analysis shows that he would have been within one stride of the current champion had he been running on a synthetic track. Similarly, Roger Bannister's four-minute mile would have been even faster had he been running on a synthetic track rather than a soft cinder track, and today athletes are training more intelligently than ever before, contributing to their progress.

In this section, it is explained that while technological advances have undoubtedly played a part in performance improvements in sports such as cycling, these are not the only factors that have driven change. There has been an artificial selection of athletic bodies, where coaches realized that specialized bodies were required for different sports. With financial incentives and fame on the line, athletes have been selected based on specialization as well. As the popularity of sports has increased, so has access to the elite performance through media such as television and the internet. As a result, specialized body types are even more evident today. For example, NBA athletes today are taller and have seven-foot-long arms, whereas female gymnasts have shrunk in size.

In this section, the speaker discusses the impact of body types and evolutionary adaptations on athletic performance. Athletes in different sports require different body types to excel, such as long torsos and short legs for swimming and long legs and a short torso for running. In some cases, the search for the perfect body type to push athletic performance introduced new populations of people into the competitive world, like Kenyan distance runners with their unique limb physiology adapted for cooling. The speaker also mentions that athletes now have a different mindset than they did in the past, and are pushing themselves to access more of their physical potential. Moreover, the democratization of sport and imagination in sport have also played a role in making athletes better than ever before.
