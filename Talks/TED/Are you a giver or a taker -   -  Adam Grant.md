In this section of the video, organizational psychologist Adam Grant discusses the three different styles of interacting with people: giving, taking, and matching. Though most people are matchers, givers make organizations better and improve team performance, even though they themselves may suffer as individuals. He then goes on to explain how givers tend to be the worst performers, but ultimately are the best ones in every job or organization he has ever studied. Takers tend to rise quickly and fall quickly, while matchers believe in justice and fairness, eventually leading to givers being the most successful style of interacting with others.

In this section, Adam Grant discusses how to create a world where more givers can excel, and how to protect them from burnout. The first critical step is to recognize that givers are the most valuable people but need to be protected. Adam Rifkin's five-minute favor is an example of a small way to add large value to other people's lives. The second thing that matters is creating a culture of help-seeking. Hospitals where help-seeking was common, hires just one nurse whose sole job it was to help other nurses on the unit. The most important thing when it comes to creating a culture of productive generosity is to be thoughtful about who you let onto your team. Effective hiring and screening are not about bringing in givers, but weeding out the takers. Grant also notes that we're pretty bad at figuring out who's a taker, and a personality trait called agreeableness throws us off.

In this section, Adam Grant explains that agreeableness-disagreeableness does not have a correlation with being a giver or a taker, as it only defines the outer veneer of a person, how pleasant they are to interact with. A two-by-two is the best way to understand who the givers and takers in your organization are, and there are four types of people to be aware of: agreeable givers, disagreeable givers, agreeable takers, and disagreeable takers. Disagreeable givers are the most undervalued people in organizations, as they are the ones who give critical feedback that no one wants to hear but everyone needs to hear. On the other hand, agreeable takers, also known as fakers, are the most harmful because they pretend to be nice but stab people in the back. In conclusion, if we can weed out the takers and protect the givers from burnout, we can create a culture where givers succeed and contribute to each other's success.
