In this section, Lorna Davis, a former CEO and now a B Corp ambassador, talks about the pitfalls of being a "heroic leader." She recounts her experience giving a big speech that garnered her roaring applause but failed to inspire action. She then introduces the idea of radical interdependence and emphasizes the importance of collaboration amongst leaders. Davis observes that B Corps, companies that believe in business as a force for good, are adopting a different approach to leadership. They see themselves as part of a whole system and set impossible-to-achieve goals that require collaboration with others. Davis cites the example of the clothing industry, which produces a staggering 92 million tons of waste annually, to illustrate this idea.

In this section, the speaker talks about interdependent leaders and how they collaborate with others to solve shared problems. She gives examples of clothing manufacturers Patagonia and Eileen Fisher, who work together to reduce waste and take responsibility for their impact on the environment and workers in the industry. Interdependent leaders declare their goals before they have a plan and invite others to co-create with them. They do not see everyone as a competitor or follower, but understand the importance of collaboration and communication in meetings to share ideas and perspectives. By changing the language used in meetings and inviting everyone's opinion, a company in China was able to reduce the impact of hero culture and allow for more open communication and collaboration.

In this section, the speaker explains how hero culture can infiltrate businesses and prevent the spread of success across the globe. To combat this, the speaker created "full-day marketplaces" where everyone was dressed up and products had to be sold as persuasively as possible. The silliness and environment helped to create a collaborative atmosphere where ideas spread rapidly. The speaker then applies these ideas to an area in which they have zero credibility or experience, which is wildlife conservation. The speaker hopes to work interdependently with others to save rhinos and believes that in order to solve the world's challenges, we need to practice interdependence and vulnerability.
