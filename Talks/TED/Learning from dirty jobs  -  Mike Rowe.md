In this section, Mike Rowe discusses his experience working on a sheep ranch job in Colorado for his show "Dirty Jobs". Prior to the job, he researched castration and learned that rubber bands should be used for the process. However, when he saw the shepherd use a knife instead, he immediately spoke up and asked to do it the “humane” way. Despite his efforts, they still performed castration with a knife on some of the lambs, causing Rowe to reconsider his own beliefs about the appropriate way to handle such a practice.

In this section, Mike Rowe talks about how society has declared war on work, both consciously and unconsciously, leading to the marginalization of many jobs. This includes how Hollywood portrays working people, with them either being turned into heroes or punch lines in TV shows, and how commercials on Madison Avenue imply that lives would be better if people didn't have to work as hard. Furthermore, the jobs that society needs, such as electricians and carpenters, are in decline, leading to a D minus rating for the infrastructure. Rowe suggests that a PR campaign for manual labor and skilled labor is necessary, in addition to creating jobs that people want, to address this issue.
