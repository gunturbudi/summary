# Summary of The riddle of experience vs. memory | Daniel Kahneman

Daniel Kahneman argues that our happiness is determined by both our experiences and our memories of those experiences. He explains that the discrepancy between experience and memory exists because the remembering self is focused on satisfaction and emotions, while the experiencing self is focused on happiness. He goes on to say that different things will make the experiencing self happy, such as spending time with people that they like or having goals.

Daniel Kahneman discusses the three cognitive traps that can prevent people from thinking about happiness correctly- a reluctance to admit complexity, a confusion between experience and memory, and the focusing illusion. He provides an example of a situation in which one's memory of an experience is ruined, and discusses the implications of this on our understanding of ourselves and others.

Daniel Kahneman explains that the experiences we have in our lives are remembered by the remembering self differently than the experiencing self. The experiencing self lives its life continuously, but most of the moments of our lives are lost and ignored by the remembering self. The remembering self makes decisions, and when a patient is deciding which surgeon to choose based on their experiences, the experiencing self has no voice.

Daniel Kahneman argues that the discrepancy between experience and memory exists because the remembering self is focused on satisfaction and emotions, while the experiencing self is focused on happiness. He goes on to say that different things will make the experiencing self happy, such as spending time with people that they like or having goals. He concludes by saying that we should not view happiness as a single concept, but rather as a combination of both experiences.

Daniel Kahneman discusses the results of a Gallup survey that found that people below an income of 60,000 dollars a year are unhappy, and that this misery increases the further one gets above 60,000 dollars a year. He also discusses the different effects income has on the experiencing and reflective selfs, with income increasing the satisfaction of the reflective self but not the experiencing self. He predicts that future public policy will focus on happiness research, and that the discussion around it will be the most interesting policy conversation to watch in the next few years.
