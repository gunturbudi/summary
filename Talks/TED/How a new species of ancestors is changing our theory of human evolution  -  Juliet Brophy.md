# Summary of How a new species of ancestors is changing our theory of human evolution | Juliet Brophy

Paleoanthropologist Juliet Brophy discusses the discovery of Homo naledi, a new species in the Homo genus, in this video. The fossils found in the Rising Star cave system forced researchers to modify their theories on human evolution due to the unique characteristics of the specimens. Naledi had a mixture of primitive and derived traits, with a small brain size but a hand-wrist morphology similar to species that made and used stone tools. The discovery has forced scientists to reassess what it means to be in the Homo genus and has shown evidence of a species coexisting with modern humans, raising questions about their interactions.

In this section, Juliet Brophy, a paleoanthropologist, explains how her team discovered Homo naledi, a new species in the Homo genus. With this discovery, their current patterns of evolutionary change were disrupted and have forced them to change the way they think about human evolution. Brophy and her team analyzed fossils that were excavated from the Rising Star cave system, and this unprecedented collection of around 1,800 specimens, including 15 individual skeletons, was recovered from the Dinaledi Chamber. They had a difficult task of identifying the species of the fossils and found that they had characteristics that did not match known species. This discovery has changed the way researchers think about the evolution of the Homo genus and, in turn, forced them to modify our previous theories and make changes to the human evolution tree.

In this section, Juliet Brophy discusses the Rising Star specimens and the new species that have been borne out of them, called Homo naledi. These fossils present a mix of primitive and derived traits, with the skull being similar to early Homo males, but the brain being half the size of modern humans. The teeth of the specimens are also unique, with the third molar being the largest, and the first molar being the smallest, a primitive condition. The position of the shoulders suggests that naledi was a climber; the flared pelvis, curved fingers, wrist, long slender legs, and modern feet are all consistent with other members of the genus Homo. These fossils have taught us to reassess what it means to be in the genus Homo, to rethink what it means to be human and to question how much morphological variation exists in the genus. Furthermore, we have concrete evidence of a species coexisting with modern humans, meaning we must consider how they interacted.

In this section, the speaker discusses the role of brain size in identifying a species as a tool user and how the notion has been questioned. She also highlights that Homo naledi has a hand-wrist morphology similar to other species that made and used stone tools, despite its small brain size, suggesting it had the capability. This means that we can no longer assume the toolmaker of sites with no associated species. The speaker explains that the discovery of Homo naledi has brought us closer to better understanding our evolutionary past and that we still have many questions to answer, even with the increase in sample size.
