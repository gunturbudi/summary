# Summary of Aicha Evans: Your self-driving robotaxi is almost here | TED

Aicha Evans discusses the concept of autonomous robotaxis and its potential benefits for transportation and the environment. She explores the role of computer vision, different sensors used in autonomous driving and the significance of software innovation. Although the camera and algorithms cannot match the human brain's ability to interpret the environment, computer vision has advanced significantly, reducing the number of accidents caused by human error. She also emphasizes the need for rigorous testing and optimization to ensure the safety, reliability and efficiency of autonomous robotaxis. Ultimately, she believes that computer vision is a gift that will transform all industries and is what we owe to the next generation.

In this section, Aicha Evans discussed the concept of robotaxis and its potential benefits for transportation and the environment. These autonomous vehicles are not the same as personal self-driving cars that still require a human behind the wheel. Robotaxis will take you specifically from point A to B, and when not being used, others will have the opportunity to use them. At the core of computer vision, which is critical for autonomous vehicles, is camera systems and significant advancements in technology including machine learning and software innovation. However, the camera and algorithms at present cannot match the human brain's ability to understand and interpret the environment.
