In this section, Jane Goodall discusses her recent experiences in the rainforest of Ecuador and the indigenous people who live there, who are fighting to keep oil companies and roads out of their forests in order to live in a clean and non-polluted world. Goodall also introduces the voice of the animal kingdom, specifically that of chimpanzees in Tanzania, which she has been studying since 1960, and highlights modern technologies that have transformed the way field biologists do their work, such as DNA profiling through analyzing fecal samples.

In this section, Goodall discusses how technology has improved her ability to study animals such as chimpanzees, allowing her to discover that they are capable of performances previously thought impossible by science. She gives an example of Ai, a chimpanzee in captivity in Japan who is skilled in intellectual performance and uses a computer with a touchpad to perform complex tasks. Goodall also notes that chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans have learned to use human sign language. She recalls her first observation of a chimpanzee using a tool and the impact it had on the view of animals' cognitive abilities. She notes that the line dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom is getting fuzzier as we discover that animals are capable of much more than previously believed.

In this section, Goodall discusses the long-term affectionate supportive bonds that form amongst chimpanzees and last for a lifetime. She highlights how they share similar emotions to humans, such as happiness, sadness, fear, and despair, and also have a sense of humor. Goodall argues that admitting that other animals have personalities, minds, and feelings should instill a newfound respect for them and encourage us to consider the ways we use and abuse them. However, chimpanzees, in particular, are disappearing rapidly due to deforestation, human population growth, and illegal hunting, along with other human activities. This not only affects the chimpanzees, but also indigenous human cultures that depend on them, leading to cultural and ecological destruction.

In this section of the video, Jane Goodall discusses the fundamental feature that sets humans apart from chimpanzees and other creatures - our advanced spoken language, which allows us to communicate ideas, plan for the future, and pass on accumulated wisdom. However, our abuse of this power, particularly in the developed world, is harming ourselves, the animals, and nature. Goodall emphasizes the interconnectedness of humans and nature and how many problems stem from the greed of the developed world. She urges young people to take action with her program Roots and Shoots, which is a message of hope for a better world. Goodallâ€™s deep shame for harming the planet since her childhood motivates her to encourage everyone to make a difference and emphasizes that every individual has a role to play in making the world a better place.

In this section, Jane Goodall discusses the Roots and Shoots program, which focuses on children and involves them in projects that make the world a better place. The program consists of three types of projects: care and concern for human communities, animals, and local environments, and what the kids do depends on their age, wealth, and location. The children buy into the program, and they are the ones who get to decide what they will do. Goodall expresses hope in the future, highlighting that the human brain is rising to solve problems that are happening globally.

In this section, Jane Goodall discusses the resilience of nature and how humans can both damage and repair it. She also emphasizes the indomitable human spirit and the courage and love that can arise in challenging situations. Goodall believes that hope lies in the hands of individuals, and that conscious choices, such as buying ethical products and reducing ecological footprints, can lead to significant positive change for the environment and the world.
