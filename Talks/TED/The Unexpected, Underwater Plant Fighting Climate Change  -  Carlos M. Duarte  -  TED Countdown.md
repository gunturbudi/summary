# Summary of The Unexpected, Underwater Plant Fighting Climate Change | Carlos M. Duarte | TED Countdown

The video discusses the importance of seagrass meadows in the ocean's ecosystem, and how they are declining due to human activity. Carlos Duarte, a seagrass restoration expert, is working to reverse this trend by identifying new areas for seagrass growth and by developing a method for farming marine rice, a crop that does not require arable land, fresh water, or any of the other resources that seagrasses need.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Seagrasses occupy only 0.1 percent of the seafloor but are responsible for one-third of all carbon removed from the seafloor annually. They are very effective carbon sequesters due to their large canopies and slow decomposition. Seagrass meadows are also important ecosystems due to their ability to raise the seafloor and filter out particles from the water.

The video discusses how seagrass meadows play an important role in the ocean's carbon sequestration and coastal defense, and how they have been declining in recent decades. By partnering with better swimmers and studying the areas where seagrasses are found, researchers are able to identify new areas that need protection and restoration.

The video presents the work of Carlos Duarte, a chef and seagrass restoration expert, which has shown that seagrasses can be used as a source of marine rice, a crop that does not require arable land, fresh water, fertilizers, herbicides, or pesticides. The video also discusses Duarte's vision for the future of marine conservation, in which we can achieve a healthy ocean by 2050 by restoring and rebuilding the abundance of life in the ocean.
