# Summary of The Massive Machines Removing Carbon from Earth's Atmosphere | Jan Wurzbacher | TED

This video discusses the Orca CO2 extraction plant, which is a commercial direct air capture and storage plant. The plant costs 10 million dollars to build and can extract 10 tons of carbon dioxide from the air every day using low-temperature heat and renewable energy. The next step for Climeworks and other companies is to scale up the technology and have plants that are constantly operating, 24/7.

In his talk, Jan Wurzbacher discusses the need for technology-based solutions to remove carbon from the atmosphere in order to meet climate goals. He describes one such technology, direct air capture, and shows a rock sample that was formed from carbon dioxide turned into stone underground. He points out that technology-based solutions are a necessity and that the industry needs to focus on developing larger-scale and cheaper solutions.

This video discusses the Climeworks scale-up project, which is designed to increase the number of carbon capture plants around the world. The video highlights the challenges that need to be overcome in order to successfully deploy these plants, as well as the importance of taking action in order to prevent climate change.
