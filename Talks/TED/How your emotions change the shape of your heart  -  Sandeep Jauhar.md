# Summary of How your emotions change the shape of your heart | Sandeep Jauhar

The speaker in this video explains how emotions can have a direct effect on the human heart and can cause profound cardiac injury, damaging the blood vessels and causing the heart to gallop. The speaker also discusses the heart disorder called Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or "the broken heart syndrome," where intense stress weakens the heart. Research shows that emotional factors play a very important role in heart health, and studies conducted on rabbits and patients with coronary disease found that human interaction and stress management can reduce plaque in the heart. The speaker calls for greater attention to the power and importance of emotions in maintaining heart health to prioritize the role of emotions in heart care.

In this section, the video discusses the metaphorical and symbolic association of the heart with love and emotions, and how emotions can have a real and direct effect on the human heart. While it's known that the heart is not the source of emotions, the connection between the heart and emotions is intimate. Fear and grief, for example, can cause profound cardiac injury, triggering blood vessels to constrict, the heart to gallop and blood pressure to rise, ultimately resulting in damage. The video also discusses a heart disorder called takotsubo cardiomyopathy or "the broken heart syndrome," in which the heart acutely weakens in response to intense stress, such as the death of a loved one.

In this section, the speaker explains that emotional stress can lead to physical changes in the heart, such as in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This condition has been linked to various stressful situations, including natural disasters and happy events. The speaker also discusses the history of heart syndromes related to intense emotional disturbance, such as the "Voodoo" Death studied by Harvard physiologist Walter Cannon in 1942. The speaker notes that these associations between emotional and physical health hold true in both humans and animals.

In this section of the video, speaker Sandeep Jauhar explains that research has shown that emotional factors play a crucial role in heart health. A study conducted on rabbits found that the rabbits that received human interaction had less aortic disease than rabbits that were left alone, despite having similar risk factors. A study conducted on patients with coronary disease found that those who implemented lifestyle changes including stress management had a near 5% reduction in coronary plaque, while those who relied only on diet and exercise had more plaque at one and five years. Jauhar notes that while cardiology has made progress with scientific medicine, there may be limits to what it can do and shifts to include psychosocial factors in treating heart problems may be needed.

In this section, Sandeep Jauhar emphasizes that emotional stress is a key risk factor for heart disease and calls for greater attention to the power and importance of emotions in maintaining heart health. He notes that while blood cholesterol is an important risk factor, it is easier to tackle than emotional disruption, which can have life and death consequences. Jauhar suggests that we need to recognize the reality of a "broken heart" as a physical phenomenon and take action to prioritize the role of emotions in heart care.
