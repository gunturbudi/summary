# Summary of What You Can Do to Prevent Alzheimer's | Lisa Genova | TED

In a TED talk, Lisa Genova discusses the neuroscience of Alzheimer's disease, emphasizing that too much amyloid beta causes the accumulation of amyloid plaques. Researchers are developing drugs to prevent amyloid plaque accumulation, but lifestyle changes such as getting quality sleep, maintaining a balanced Mediterranean diet, and focusing on neural plasticity and cognitive reserve can also prevent, delay, or decrease the chance of Alzheimer's. Even if someone with Alzheimer's has compromised synapses, cognitive reserve can help buffer them from noticing any symptoms, stressing the importance of building an Alzheimer's-resistant brain by learning new things. Finally, Genova offers three lessons: a diagnosis doesn't mean death, keep living and enjoying life, and emotional memory is not affected by Alzheimer's.

In this section, Lisa Genova talks about the neuroscience of Alzheimer's and explains that too much amyloid beta in the synapse, which normally is cleared away by microglia, causes the accumulation of sticky aggregates called amyloid plaques. This initial step into the disease has already begun for individuals who are 40 years old or older, but without any visible warning signs since it takes at least 15 to 20 years before it reaches a tipping point and causes the clinical symptoms of the disease. Beyond the tipping point, the glitches in memory, language, and cognition that one experiences will be different, which results from the hyper-activated microglia janitor cells causing inflammation and cellular damage, ultimately resulting in cell death, indicating a mid-stage Alzheimer's.

In this section, the focus is on prevention - specifically, preventing, delaying, or decreasing amyloid plaque accumulation to reduce the chance of Alzheimer's onset. Scientists are currently developing drugs to prevent amyloid plaque accumulation, but these drugs have failed with previous symptomatic patients. Instead, researchers are highlighting lifestyle changes such as getting quality sleep and focusing on cardiovascular health through an active and balanced Mediterranean diet. However, even if a person is symptomatic with Alzheimer's, neural plasticity and cognitive reserve can protect against the symptoms of Alzheimer's by focusing on activities that strengthen synapse development.

In this section, the speaker discusses how neural plasticity and cognitive reserve can help prevent Alzheimer's disease. Neural plasticity is the process by which people learn something new, create new neural connections, and strengthen synapses. Cognitive reserve refers to the abundance and redundancy of neural connections, which people can develop through formal education, literacy, and mentally-stimulating activities. The speaker explains that even when someone with Alzheimer's disease has their synapses compromised, having cognitive reserve can help buffer them from noticing that anything is amiss. She stresses the importance of building an Alzheimer's-resistant brain by learning new things and paving new neural roads, rather than simply retrieving information that has already been learned. Finally, the speaker offers three lessons for those diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease: diagnosis doesn't mean you're dying anytime soon, keep living and enjoying life, and emotional memory is not affected by Alzheimer's.
