I apologize for the confusion earlier. Here is the transcript excerpt for the requested video summary:

In this TED Talk, May El-Khalil, founder of the Beirut Marathon Association, shares her personal story of how the Beirut marathon came to be a symbol of peace and unity in Lebanon. After being hit by a bus and undergoing multiple surgeries to walk again, May was inspired to organize the marathon as a way to dream big and bring her community together. Despite the challenges of introducing running to a country at the brink of war, the Beirut Marathon Association grew in credibility and popularity, welcoming runners from around the world. The marathon proved to be a platform for hope and cooperation in an ever-fragile and unstable part of the world, and continues to inspire runners to run under the "umbrella of peace."

In this section, May El-Khalil shares the story of how the Beirut marathon was born out of her personal tragedy, the civil war, and the hope for peace. She was once a marathon runner, but after being hit by a bus, she was hospitalized and underwent 36 surgeries to walk again. She then decided to organize the marathon as a way to dream big, rebuild her community, and invite runners from around the world to run under the 'umbrella of peace.' Despite the challenges of introducing running to a nation at the brink of war, May walked the talk, met people from all walks of life, and worked towards building trust and transparency. In October 2003, the Beirut marathon had over 6,000 runners from 49 different nationalities, all determined to run in harmony.

In this section, May El-Khalil describes how the marathon has become a platform for peace and unity in Lebanon, especially during the country's unstable years from 2006 to 2009. Despite political problems and even assassinations, the Beirut Marathon Association (BMA) found ways to bring people together through the marathon. It gained credibility both locally and internationally, even expanding to include various groups of runners and causes, such as the first annual all-women-and-girls race for empowerment. Through the BMA, a culture of giving and doing good has been created, and stereotypes have been broken, making it a platform for hope and cooperation in an ever-fragile and unstable part of the world.
