In this section of the video, Pankaj Ghemawat challenges the commonly held belief that national borders have little significance in a globalized world. He presents data on various types of cross-border flows, including telephone calls, migration, investment, and trade, to show that the world is not as flat as many people think. For instance, only 2% of voice-calling minutes last year were accounted for by cross-border phone calls. Ghemawat argues that it is important to have an accurate understanding of the level of globalization in order to make informed decisions about international business and policy.

In this section, Pankaj Ghemawat explains that the misconception of a globalized world, known as “globaloney,” has been overstated by apocalyptic authors and misjudged by audiences surveyed in different parts of the world. With a lack of data in the debate and peer pressure to conform to the popular notion of a borderless world, many have been prone to overestimating trade-to-GDP ratios. Ghemawat urges individuals to seek out and assess their own data on the matter to challenge the hand-me-down insights that have been bombarding us for years.

In this section, Pankaj Ghemawat explains how globaloney (exaggerated conceptions of globalization) can be harmful to people's understanding of globalization's limits and potential benefits. He uses Facebook as an example and adds that pre-existing matrix of relationships play a key role in our number of international friends on Facebook. Ghemawat also shows how accurate understanding of globalization levels can help contribute further to the welfare of the global society.

In this section, Ghemawat discusses a survey that showed people became more willing to consider increases in foreign aid when they were informed about how far their estimations were from the actual data. He highlights the home-bias phenomenon among countries as most countries spent 30,000 times more per domestic poor person than per poor person in poor countries. He suggests that if the ratio is brought down to 15,000 to one, the aid targets agreed upon at the Rio summit 20 years ago would be met. Overall, Ghemawat emphasizes that while radical openness is great, even incremental openness could have a significant impact on making things better.
