In this section, Shervin Khodabandeh, an AI expert, argues that the most successful companies integrate AI capabilities into their workforce, creating a "symbiotic human-AI relationship". Rather than seeing AI as a replacement for humans, the best companies use AI to augment and amplify human skills, creating better collaboration, lower financial costs, and more effective employees. Using company Humana as an example, Khodabandeh describes how an AI system assists pharmacists in real-time during phone conversations with patients, helping them read emotional cues and improve their performance. The result is a more effective workforce with a higher level of customer satisfaction.
