The challenges of combating disinformation spread by mega-platforms are discussed along with the need for regulating who pays the platforms rather than moderating everything that is said.

In this section, the speaker highlights the importance of internet access for economic and individual development, particularly in developing countries. With the majority accessing the internet through a handful of applications on their phones, internet exchange points, which are often securely guarded buildings, are critical to the infrastructure of the internet. The speaker also describes the power of the internet for decentralized mass organization and shares examples of governments shutting off the internet to quell protests, but how protests can still continue through guerrilla cyberwarfare tactics.

In this section, the speaker discusses the challenges of combating disinformation spread by mega-platforms, which have become nearly impossible to moderate, leading to misinformation campaigns like the conspiracy theory linking 5G to coronavirus that resulted in over 30 arson attacks on cell towers in the UK. The speaker advocates that the platforms are more than capable of disrupting and regulating who pays them, rather than attempting to moderate everything that is said, however, regulating advertising is difficult as it is how most platforms make their money. The speaker warns against proposals to connect social media accounts to government-issued identification, as anonymity is necessary to protect marginalized groups and political dissidents who rely on free speech.

In this section, we learn about different country's approach to controlling their version of the internet within their borders, with national firewalls being used to restrict unwanted information but mainly to crush organization beyond party political structures. Governments are not to be trusted with regulating disinformation, as seen from the Facebook scandal in 2018 where over 1.3 billion fake accounts were deleted. The conversation shifts to the impact of mega-platforms, as around 80% of internet traffic is captured by only a handful of companies, highlighting their reign is not assured as demonstrated by internal projections at Facebook where teenagers are abandoning the platform. Though the internet is in its infancy, and new competitors are gathering in every corner, the current state of control and power balance should not be taken lightly.

In this section, the speaker discusses the rise of super apps like WeChat, which has integrated itself into the daily lives of Chinese citizens by becoming a one-stop shop for all their needs, from paying bills to booking flights and doctor's appointments. While these apps have made life easier for many, they also threaten to erode privacy and enable government surveillance. The speaker argues that it is important to maintain a plural internet that is open, accessible, and suspicious of authority to ensure that the internet of the future reflects the best of us.
