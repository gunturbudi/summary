# Summary of Will automation take away all our jobs? | David Autor

David Autor discusses the impact of automation on the job market, highlighting the paradox that the fraction of US adults employed in the labor market has increased despite the introduction of machines and automation. The interconnection of tasks forms a chain that depends on each other's reliability, and as technology improves, it magnifies our expertise, creativity, and judgment, making our human skills more valuable. However, there is a challenge that automation poses, which is the polarization of the job market, and to overcome this challenge, society needs to invest in institutions, particularly schools, to create a skilled and flexible workforce, as happened in the late 1800s and early 1900s when automation started eliminating vast numbers of agricultural jobs. The future does not hinge on any individual's imagination, and humanity has found remarkable things to do with prosperity after the reduction of agricultural employment, from 40% to 2%, in 100 years.

In this section, David Autor discusses the paradox that despite the introduction of machines and automation to the workplace, the fraction of US adults employed in the labour market has increased since 1890. He explains that automation has led to the replacement of human physical toil and error-prone calculation with machine perfection, but this has not eliminated human employment because it only automates some tasks and makes others more important, increasing their economic value. He introduces the concept of the O-ring production function, which he defines as a series of interlocking steps, where every link must hold for the mission to succeed. Any of the links fails and everything falls apart, illustrating how human genius and creativity are still necessary in the face of automation.

In this section, David Autor explains how tasks are interconnected, forming a chain that depends on each other's reliability. Once all links in the chain become dependable and robust, the importance of each link increases, including jobs. As technology improves, it magnifies our expertise, creativity, and judgment, making our human skills more valuable. Consequently, he believes there will always be jobs. However, he also warns that automation creates wealth, but it's essential to critically examine if that wealth is used to foster human prosperity.

In this section, the speaker discusses the challenge that automation poses to society, which is not the loss of jobs, but rather the polarization of the job market in which the middle sectors of education and wages are shrinking. This phenomenon is due to jobs that use simple rules and procedures that are being codified in software and carried out by computers, which creates a more stratified and unequal society with a dominant class and many low-paid jobs supporting them. To overcome this challenge, society needs to invest in institutions, particularly schools, to create a skilled and flexible workforce, as happened in the late 1800s and early 1900s when automation started eliminating vast numbers of agricultural jobs. The speaker concludes by emphasizing that it is within our power to shape our future, not the machines nor the market, but ourselves through our institutions.

In this section, David Autor discusses the common fear that automation will take away jobs, emphasizing that historical examples demonstrate our endless desires and inventiveness mean there is always new work to be done, and technology magnifies the added value of human expertise, judgment, and creativity. While adjusting to the rapid pace of technological change creates real economic mobility challenges, as it has done throughout history, it is feasible with investment in ourselves and our children as America did with the high school movement a hundred years ago. Though scholars and activists have raised the alarm that we are running out of work and making ourselves obsolete in the last 200 years, these predictions are arrogant, and the future does not hinge on any individual's imagination. The reduction of agricultural employment from 40% to 2% in 100 years was an amazing amount of progress, from which humanity found remarkable things to do with prosperity.
