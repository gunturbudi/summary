In this section, Elizabeth Dunn discusses her research on how giving to others can promote happiness. Her research team found that toddlers showed more happiness when giving away a portion of their snacks rather than keeping them all for themselves. In adults, research showed that those who gave to charity reported higher levels of happiness compared to those who did not. This effect replicated around the world, suggesting that giving may be a part of human nature. Despite her research, Dunn initially did not give much to charity, but she resolved to give more after encountering stories about the Syrian refugee crisis.

In this section, the speaker shares her personal experience of sponsoring a refugee family, an initiative in Canada that allows five Canadians to privately sponsor a family of refugees. Although she knew her donations would make a difference, she wanted to do more and help in a more tangible way. Through this experience, she realized that people experience greater emotional returns on investment when they feel a real sense of connection with those they help and can easily envision the difference they are making in those individuals' lives. Additionally, people need to be able to envision how exactly their donations are making a difference in order to experience greater happiness.
