# Summary of What the World Can Learn From Chinaâ€™s Innovation Playbook | Keyu Jin | TED

Keyu Jin explores China's model of innovation and technological growth, emphasizing the importance of an innovation ecosystem, collaboration between universities, national labs, industries, and massive funding. She describes China's "Jugo system," which mobilizes national resources to achieve a strategic goal, and the "mayor economy" model that galvanizes creativity from the ground-up. Although this approach has its challenges, Jin notes that competition and mutual learning between countries are essential for pushing the technology frontier. She also emphasizes the need to prioritize the cheapest and best technologies to ensure a brighter future for all and grant the developing world the right to enjoy the same dignity as their fortunate peers.

In this section, the speaker explains how China has become a country of abundance, particularly in terms of technological power, despite still being a developing country. She offers a unique perspective on China's model of fostering innovation and technological growth. The speaker notes that innovation is not just about inventing new things but also about new applications and better processes that make things leaner, cleaner, and more productive. China has been successful in this regard, with companies like TikTok, BYD, and Chinese mobile phone manufacturers making significant strides. The speaker also emphasizes the importance of an innovation ecosystem that involves collaboration between universities, national labs, and industries, coupled with enormous amounts of funding that covers long and uncertain investment cycles.

In this section, the speaker discusses China's "Jugo system," which is a horizontal system with critical state backing used to mobilize national resources to achieve one strategic goal. Through this system, China became the largest producer and consumer of EVs in less than a decade, with more cars being sold there than in the rest of the world combined in 2020. Additionally, the speaker talks about the "mayor economy" model, which is a decentralized economic model that galvanizes creativity from the ground up. The model involves a marriage between hypercharged local officials and intrepid entrepreneurs of all ilk that is at the heart of China's approach to innovation, which combines political centralization and economic decentralization.

In this section, the speaker acknowledges that China's approach to innovation is not perfect and comes with its own set of challenges. However, she also notes that there is more than one way of making things work and that there's something to learn from each other. The speaker emphasizes the importance of competition and mutual learning between countries for pushing the technology frontier further and beyond. She also highlights that economic disengagement between the two largest countries in the world can have dire consequences for global issues such as eradicating malaria and hunger, and preserving biodiversity. Therefore, it's crucial to prioritize the cheapest and best technologies to achieve a brighter future for all and ensure that people in the developing world have the right to enjoy the same dignity as those who are more fortunate.
