# Summary of How we teach computers to understand pictures | Fei Fei Li

This video discusses the field of computer vision and how it aims to give machines the ability to understand pictures and videos. It talks about the challenges faced in teaching computers to understand objects, and how the ImageNet project has been helpful in this regard. The video also discusses the work of three pioneers in the field of artificial intelligence who developed a method for teaching computers to understand pictures.

Detail Summary:

Computer vision is a field of research that aims to give machines the ability to understand pictures and videos. One of the main challenges faced is teaching computers to understand objects, something that is done by training them with examples.

Images taken from everyday life provide a vast amount of training examples for computer algorithms, which can be helpful in understanding pictures. The ImageNet project, launched in 2007, collected nearly a billion images and used crowdsourcing to label them.

This video discusses the work of three pioneers in the field of artificial intelligence - Kunihiko Fukushima, Geoff Hinton, and Yann LeCun - who developed a method for teaching computers to understand pictures. The method, called a neural network, takes input from other nodes and sends output to others in a hierarchical manner similar to the way the brain works. Neural networks are powered by massive data sets from ImageNet, which has allowed them to achieve great results in object recognition. However, the method is still in its early stages and is only capable of generating human-like sentences when it sees a picture for the first time.

This video discusses the challenges of teaching computers to see pictures, and how this has been a long journey. The narrator talks about his son, Leo, and how he is constantly in his mind while working on this project. The video finishes by saying that machines will help us to explore new frontiers and find new species.
