# Summary of What AI is -- and isn't | Sebastian Thrun and Chris Anderson

Sebastian Thrun and Chris Anderson discuss the benefits of machine learning, using examples such as AlphaGo and self-driving cars. They discuss how deep learning has improved self-driving cars and lament the possibility of AI learning to rewrite its own code and creating a runaway effect. However, the speakers acknowledge that AI is still in its infancy and specialized, domain-specific function rather than general AI. Thrun believes that AI will make us much stronger as a human race, freeing up humans from repetitive work to be creative, and allowing us to turn ideas into action. Additionally, he argues that AI only assists us in doing repetitive jobs and has not seen any real progress on creativity and out-of-the-box thinking from machines.

In this section, Sebastian Thrun and Chris Anderson discuss the concept of machine learning as a key driver of artificial intelligence and how it works. Essentially, machine learning means that instead of a human expert writing out millions of lines of code with every possible contingency, a computer can now receive examples and have the ability to infer its own rules. An example is AlphaGo, which beat the world's reigning Go champion by looking at over a million games to understand the rules and find the winning pattern. Self-driving cars have also improved thanks to machine learning. Rather than having the best software engineers algorithmically write out the world's best rules, self-driving cars can drive for many hours, millions of miles and learn from the data they generate.

In this section, Sebastian Thrun and Chris Anderson discuss examples of how deep learning has been applied in the real world. Thrun talks about an example where Udacity students were given a self-driving car dataset and asked to figure out how to steer the car, which they were able to do within 48 hours using deep learning. He then describes the use of neural networks in dermatology to classify skin conditions as accurately as human dermatologists and recounts an anecdote where a world-famous dermatologist used their software to correctly diagnose a patient with an aggressive melanoma. They discuss the possibility of making an app for self-checking, but Thrun stresses the need for more testing before releasing any such app.

In this section, Sebastian Thrun and Chris Anderson discuss how the combination of machine learning and human wisdom can create amazing results. Thrun shares how his army of Udacity students have created a self-driving car in three months and remarks about the synthesis of great people and machine learning. Anderson brings up concerns about AI learning to rewrite its own code and creating a runaway effect, but Thrun asserts that the possibility of this is remote. He emphasizes that AI is an augmentation of people to make us stronger and that machines making us stronger is as old as machines themselves. Thrun believes that AI will make us much stronger as a human race.

In this section, the speakers discuss the possibility of a runaway effect in AI which could result in the loss of jobs. However, the speakers also acknowledge that everything successful in AI to date has been specialized, domain-specific function rather than general AI, which is still at its infancy. According to Sebastian Thrun, the big revolution is the ability to take anything repetitive and make people 10-100 times more efficient. Thrun points out the benefits of AI in freeing humans from repetitive work, allowing them to be creative and turn ideas into action.

In this section, Sebastian Thrun, an AI expert, argues that despite the common fear of AI overtaking human creativity, he has not seen any real progress on creativity and out-of-the-box thinking from machines. In fact, he believes that AI is a technology that assists us in doing only repetitive jobs with the progress being made in legal document discovery, contract drafting, and screening X-rays. Thrun also notes that humans have become superhuman with the help of technology and that we have become increasingly creative with great potential for invention in the future, leading to better affordability of necessities such as food, shelter, and transportation for everyone, regardless of their social status.
