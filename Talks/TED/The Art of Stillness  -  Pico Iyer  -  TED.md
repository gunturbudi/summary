# Summary of The Art of Stillness | Pico Iyer | TED

Pico Iyer, in his TED Talk, emphasizes the importance of stillness and paying attention in an age of constant movement and distraction. He suggests that taking even just a few moments out of every day or a few days out of every season to sit still can lead to finding out what moves you most, recalling where your truest happiness lies and bring about a sense of renewed appreciation for the world and a fresh perspective on life. Iyer argues that it is only by stepping back and taking time to be still that we can truly appreciate the bigger picture of our lives, and being able to disconnect from our devices which cloud our minds is necessary in order to find joy, be creative and share what we have got with others.
