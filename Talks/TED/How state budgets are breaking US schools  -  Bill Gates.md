In this section of the video, Bill Gates delves into the critical issue of state budgets, which he believes receives little scrutiny despite being responsible for funding most education, whether K-12 or universities. He notes that U.S. economy spends 36 percent of its money on government spending, while only taking in 26 percent, which results in a whopping 10 percent deficit. This issue arises due to state budgets being unbalanced and hiding their deficit through borrowing money, increasing withholding, delaying payments, and more. This is not only unique to California; 5 other states are facing this big problem too, and the trends and liabilities point to a bleak future unless the situation is addressed on an urgent basis by people who are focusing on finding long-term solutions rather than considering their self-serving interests.
