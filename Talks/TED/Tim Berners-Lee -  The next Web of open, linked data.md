# Summary of Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data

Tim Berners-Lee talks about the concept of linked data, a world where almost everything is connected through the Internet, creating a powerful network. He emphasizes the importance of making data public and accessible, stating that it has value and can be used to make the world a better place. Berners-Lee also emphasizes the need for interoperability to break down data silos, and encourages people to embrace linked data and demand its implementation to improve every aspect of our lives. Overall, Berners-Lee believes linked data is an idea worth spreading.

In this section, Tim Berners-Lee explains the frustration he had when working as a software engineer with incompatible data formats and documentation systems that made it difficult to create something from different parts. He then created the World Wide Web by roughing out HTML, HTTP, and the idea of URLs to connect all types of computers with different data formats. Even though it was challenging to explain at first, a grassroots movement emerged, making it fun to see people come together to put their documents on the web. Tim now wants people to put data on the web, given that there is still a huge potential for this since data can be used in all sorts of ways.

In this section, Tim Berners-Lee explains the concept of linked data, which is basically a world where everyone put data on the web and almost everything is connected through the Internet using HTTP protocol. He emphasizes that data is relationships and when one data expresses a relation, the other thing that itâ€™s related to is given a name that starts with HTTP. The more things are connected, the more powerful the data becomes. Tim talks about linked data grassroots growth and the diversity of data resources, such as science, personal, weather, events, and news. He implies that he hopes for accessible format linked data to be put up by governments, like Barack Obama said in his speech.

In this section, Berners-Lee highlights the importance of making government data public, stating that it has value and can be used to make the world a better place. He also emphasizes the value of linked data, which is used by scientists to answer questions that were not previously possible. Berners-Lee explains that data is about our lives and describes how social networking sites take data and use it to enhance the user experience, but interoperability is necessary to break down information silos. Lastly, Berners-Lee explains how the OpenStreetMap is a good example of linked data and how everyone can contribute a little bit of information to create an incredible resource.

In this section, Tim Berners-Lee explains the concept of linked data and the power it brings through connecting data together. Linked data allows individuals to demand information from multiple sources and when connected, it creates a substantial amount of power. Berners-Lee encourages TED conference attendees to embrace linked data and demand its implementation, as it has the potential to improve every aspect of our lives, both in work and pleasure. Ultimately, Berners-Lee believes linked data is an idea worth spreading.
