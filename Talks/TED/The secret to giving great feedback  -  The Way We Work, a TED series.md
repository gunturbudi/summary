In this section, the speaker discusses the ineffectiveness of traditional feedback methods and the four-part formula that can be used to give feedback in a more productive manner. The first part of the formula is a "micro-yes" question to let the person know feedback is coming, the second part is giving the data point without using blur words (words that can mean different things to different people), the third part is stating the impact of the data point on the speaker or work, and the fourth part is ending with a question to involve the speaker in joint problem-solving. Furthermore, the feedback should involve asking for feedback regularly to establish oneself as a continual learner.
