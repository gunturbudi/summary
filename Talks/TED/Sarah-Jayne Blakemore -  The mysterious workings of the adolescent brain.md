# Summary of Sarah-Jayne Blakemore: The mysterious workings of the adolescent brain

Neuroscientist Sarah-Jayne Blakemore discusses how advancements in brain imaging technology reveal that the human brain continues to develop throughout adolescence and into young adulthood, with the prefrontal cortex playing a significant role in decision-making, planning, inhibiting inappropriate behavior, social interaction, understanding other people, and self-awareness. Her lab's research showed that the medial prefrontal cortex of the adolescent brain is more active when making social decisions compared to that of the adult brain, and activity in this area decreases during adolescence. Adolescent brains are hypersensitive to the rewarding feeling of risk-taking due to the limbic system, while the prefrontal cortex, which regulates impulsivity, is still developing. Education and the environment can shape the adolescent brain, presenting a great opportunity for learning and creativity.

In this section of the video, the speaker explains how advances in brain imaging technology, such as MRI, have allowed neuroscientists to look inside the living human brain of all ages and track changes in brain structure and function. This has led to a rich and detailed picture of how the human brain develops, revealing that it continues to develop throughout adolescence and into the 20s and 30s. The speaker explains how one brain region that changes dramatically during adolescence is the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in decision-making, planning, inhibiting inappropriate behavior, social interaction, understanding other people, and self-awareness. MRI studies have shown that prefrontal cortex undergoes significant development during adolescence, with gray matter volume peaking in early adolescence before undergoing synaptic pruning, which fine-tunes brain tissue according to the environment.

In this section, Sarah-Jayne Blakemore explains the findings of her lab's research on adolescent brain function through behavioral and brain scan studies. Adolescents and adults were given tasks involving social decisions, with the participants measured for brain activity during these tasks. The data showed that the medial prefrontal cortex of the adolescent brain was more active when making social decisions compared to that of the adult brain, and activity in this area decreases during adolescence. Behavioral tasks proved that the ability to take into account another's perspective to guide behavior still develops in mid-to-late adolescence.

In this section, Sarah-Jayne Blakemore explains how the adolescent brain develops and provides insights into why teenagers tend to take more risks, sometimes appear moody, and experience heightened self-consciousness. She notes that these are not just myths or stereotypes; there are actual physical changes happening in the brain. Specifically, she points to the limbic system, the part of the brain involved in emotion processing and reward processing, which is hypersensitive to the rewarding feeling of risk-taking in adolescents compared to adults. Meanwhile, the prefrontal cortex, which helps regulate impulsivity and excessive risk-taking, is still developing in teenagers. Blakemore emphasizes that this period of life presents a great opportunity for learning and creativity and that education and the environment can help shape the adolescent brain.
