# Summary of Could a DAO Build the Next Great City? | Scott Fitsimones | TED

Scott Fitsimones, founder of CityDAO, discusses how DAOs or decentralized autonomous organizations work and how they are changing the traditional structures of ownership and investment. Fitsimones uses CityDAO as an example to show how DAO members can purchase land through public blockchain treasury by submitting proposals and voting. DAOs offer the opportunity for the wider community to own a piece, participate in management, and share in the potential upside, thus democratizing ownership and increasing economic opportunities. The speaker explains how ownership translates to voting rights in DAOs, and how this system enables fairer and more coordinated efforts to solve larger-scale problems than ever before.

In this section, the speaker discusses the CityDAO, which stands for decentralized autonomous organization, that he and his online friends created to purchase 40 acres of land near Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming and begin building a new city. The DAO is an internet-native, blockchain-governed, collectively owned organization, working towards a shared mission, where members act as peers, pooling their cryptocurrency in a treasury where they vote on how it's used. DAOs are organized through Discord channel servers, where people can share ideas and debate proposals around teams and projects rather than a traditional top-down management style. DAOs offer a wider group of people the opportunity to own a piece, participate in management, and share in the potential upside, giving the community the ownership and transparency of the organization's decision-making.

In this section, Scott Fitsimones, the founder of CityDAO, explains how DAOs work and how they are changing the traditional structures of ownership and investment. He uses CityDAO as an example to show how DAO members can purchase land through public blockchain treasury by submitting proposals and voting. He also describes other DAOs that are investing in start-ups, buying art and assets, and even raising money for a charitable cause. Although DAOs have some challenges in coordinating and regulating, they have the potential to democratize ownership and increase economic opportunities.

In this section, the speaker explains how ownership translates to voting rights in DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), and how this system enables fairer and more coordinated efforts to solve larger-scale problems than ever before. DAOs allow people to work together and trust each other, which could potentially lead to the development of the next great city.
