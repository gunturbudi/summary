# Summary of What happened when we paired up thousands of strangers to talk politics | Jochen Wegner

"Europe Talks" is a project that addressed the issue of divisiveness by enabling over 17,000 Europeans from 33 countries to have political discussions with a stranger holding different opinions. The project matched pairs based on Google Forms surveys and encouraged conversations to take place. The solution enabled people to overcome filter bubbles and gain a different perspective. Success was achieved so much that an experiment was carried out where thousands of Germans were paired up with strangers having differing political views, with discussions lasting hours, and no instances of violence. Plans are underway to expand the project to more diverse participants. Furthermore, the success of the project led to the creation of similar events in different countries, leading to the creation of "Europe Talks." Jochen Wegner believes that face-to-face discussions with strangers are vital in changing society, not only politically.

In this section of the video, Jochen Wegner highlights the success of "Europe Talks," a project where over 17,000 Europeans from 33 countries signed up to have a political discussion with a stranger who holds a different opinion. This project was started by "ZEIT ONLINE" as a response to the divided society that was becoming more apparent after the 2015-16 refugee crisis in Europe. By using simple Google Forms surveys to match people with opposing views and encouraging them to have personal one-on-one discussions, "Europe Talks" proved to be an effective way of overcoming filter bubbles and enabling people to see the world from a different perspective.

In this section, the speaker describes an experiment where thousands of Germans were paired up with strangers who had differing political views. Using a simple matching algorithm, pairs were connected and met in person to discuss various political topics over a period of hours. Remarkably, the discussions were peaceful with no instances of violence. The experiment even resulted in interactions between people who may not have been paired up otherwise, such as an AfD spokesperson and a Green party member. Overall, the experiment was a success with plans to expand it to a more diverse set of participants in the future.

In this section, Wegner discusses the success of Germany Talks, which saw 28,000 applications and was supported by the German president. Researchers surveyed the participants and found that two-thirds of the participants learnt something new about their partners and 60% agreed that their viewpoints had converged due to the discussion. Additionally, 90% of the participants enjoyed their discussion, which promoted higher levels of trust towards each other and to society in general. This led to the creation of several international events under the name "My Country Talks", such as "Britain Talks" in the UK and "Suomi puhuu" in Finland. These events allowed thousands of strangers to discuss politics and lead to the creation of "Europe Talks". Wegner believes that these face-to-face discussions with strangers are important in changing society for the better, not only through a political lens.
