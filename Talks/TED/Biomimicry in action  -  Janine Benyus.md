# Summary of Biomimicry in action | Janine Benyus

Janine Benyus discusses biomimicry, a discipline that studies and learns from the solutions of organisms and ecosystems on Earth, showcasing how it has led to innovative solutions. She explores various companies that use biomimicry to create a sustainable future, from Calera to OneSun. Benyus discusses how biomimicry can be used in areas such as energy use, insulation, and design, looking to nature to make nanotechnology safer and produce efficient wind turbines. She introduces AskNature.org, a website that organizes all biological information by design and engineering function, allowing inventors to type in a problem and learn from nature to create sustainable solutions for our planet.

In this section, Janine Benyus talks about the concept of biomimicry, a new discipline that studies and learns from the genius solutions of organisms and ecosystems on the planet. She marvels at the orchestration of spring and the timing and coordination of all organisms without top-down laws, policies, or climate change protocols. She cites the example of a wasp's nest built outside her door and how her young neighbor believed humans made it because it was so well-done. Janine reminds us that organisms on this planet have been building, processing, optimizing, waterproofing, and heating/cooling structures for billions of years. Biomimicry is nature's apprenticeship that helps us learn from nature and focus on function every time we invent something.

In this section, Janine Benyus showcases some examples of how biomimicry, or taking inspiration from nature, has led to innovative solutions. She talks about a birdwatcher engineer who studied kingfishers to solve the problem of the bullet train's sonic boom, and how Sharklet Technologies is using shark skin patterns to prevent bacteria from landing in hospitals. She also mentions how the Namibian desert beetle's ability to drink water from fog has inspired architectural firms like Grimshaw to develop similar water collection systems for buildings. Benyus discusses various companies that use biomimicry to create a more sustainable future, from Calera, which uses CO2 as a building block in cement manufacturing, to OneSun, a solar cell company that is based on the workings of a leaf.

In this section, Janine Benyus talks about how organisms are able to use a minimum amount of material to create strong and resilient structures, while human-made products often require multiple layers of different materials to achieve similar functions. She also discusses how biomimicry can be used to create sustainable and innovative solutions to problems in areas such as energy use, insulation, and design. For example, scientists are looking to nature to find ways to make nanotechnology safer and learn from the energy efficiency of social insects, while others are studying the humpback whale's flippers to increase the efficiency of wind turbines. Additionally, Benyus advocates for the creation of cities that are held to higher standards of environmental performance to more closely mimic the ecosystems they replace.

In this section, Janine Benyus, a biologist and innovation consultant, talks about the importance of learning from nature in order to create conditions that are conducive to life on Earth. She introduces a website called AskNature.org that aims to organize all biological information by design and engineering function. The website allows inventors to type in a problem, which will then give them examples from nature that have already solved similar problems. By doing so, they can learn from the geniuses of the natural world and create sustainable solutions for our planet.
