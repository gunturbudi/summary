# Summary of Todd Kuiken: A prosthetic arm that "feels"

In this video, Todd Kuiken discusses the evolution of bionics for people with arm amputations. He explains how myoelectric prostheses work and why they do not work well for people who have lost their arm above the elbow. He talks about his approach called targeted reinnervation, which involves taking a nerve from the chest muscle and letting arm nerves grow into it. This allows a person to control their prosthetic arm by thinking about movements and has been successful in patients with above-the-elbow amputations. Kuiken also discusses the potential of a prosthetic arm that can provide sensation and demonstrates some challenges he faced in developing this technology. His research team remains committed to creating a prosthetic arm that is small, light, and intelligent, with the potential to provide sensation feedback to the user.

In this section, Todd Kuiken discusses bionics and its evolution for people with arm amputations. He notes the functional impairment and emotional and social impacts associated with arm amputations. Two general types of prosthetics, body-powered and myoelectric, were invented for arm amputations. Myoelectric prostheses work by using little electrical signals from the muscles. However, these devices do not work well for people who have lost their arm above the elbow. The solution was to develop a neural interface that can connect to a person's nervous system or thought processes. The nerves in the human body still work even after an arm amputation. By tapping the nerve ending of an amputee, they can still feel their missing hand. The solution they developed uses a biological amplifier.

In this section, Todd Kuiken discusses his approach called targeted reinnervation, which involves taking a nerve from the chest muscle and letting arm nerves grow into it. This allows a person to control their prosthetic arm by thinking about movements, and the signals are picked up by electrodes or antennae. This approach was successfully trialed on Jesse Sullivan, who also experienced the sensation of touch in his missing hand. The targeted reinnervation approach has also been used with patients who have above-the-elbow amputations, resulting in improved speed and smoothness of movement. The audience is introduced to Amanda Kitts, a patient who lost her arm in a car accident in 2006.

In this section, Todd Kuiken and Amanda Kitts discuss the success of the targeted reinnervation surgery, which allows amputees to use their elbow and hand in an intuitive and simultaneous way just by their thoughts. The surgery has been performed on over 50 patients worldwide, including U.S. armed forces veterans. The success rate of the nerve transfers is high, at around 96 percent. The surgery has led to the development of a prosthetic arm that can perform different grasps, and a small microcomputer enables Amanda to control it using individual muscle signals. Todd Kuiken's team's next goal is to have a clinically pragmatic device.

In this section, Todd Kuiken discusses the potential of a prosthetic arm that can provide sensation, and demonstrates how individuals who have had amputations can use different grips with a prosthetic arm. He showcased Claudia, who felt sensation through her prosthetic arm and was able to differentiate between different textures. He also demonstrated some challenges he faced in developing this technology, such as the size of the electrodes around the motor in the prosthetic arm. However, despite the challenges, Kuiken and his research team remain committed to creating a prosthetic arm that is small, light, and intelligent, with the potential to provide sensation feedback to the user.
