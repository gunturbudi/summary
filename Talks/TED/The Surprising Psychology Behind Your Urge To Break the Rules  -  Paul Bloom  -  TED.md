He presents examples of perverse behavior, including benign actions such as walking on grass and more extreme actions of malicious intent and violence.

In this section, Paul Bloom discusses the concept of perversity and the reasons behind the allure of irrational, perverse behavior. One reason is that the unpredictable nature of perverse individuals makes them more difficult to hack, while also making their threats more frightening. Additionally, individuals sometimes engage in perverse behavior as a result of a desire for autonomy or reactance, which occurs when people experience a threat to or loss of their free behaviors. This desire to rebel against othersâ€™ control can lead to perverse actions, and attempting to criticize, shame or discourage these actions have ironic results, often leading people to engage in that exact action.
