# Summary of How trees talk to each other | Suzanne Simard

In this video, Suzanne Simard discusses her groundbreaking research on the interconnected world beneath the forest floor, revealing the cooperative and communicative nature of trees. Her experiment proved that trees were exchanging carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and other information through a massive belowground network, making the forest function as a single organism. This discovery opens the possibility of more sustainable forestry practices, recognizing the mutualistic symbiosis between trees. Simard also highlights the vulnerability of simplified forests and gives recommendations to regenerate forests with a diversity of species and structures to allow Mother Nature to self-heal. She reminds us that forests are super-cooperators rather than competitors, and we can learn a lot from their complex and intelligent world.

In this section, Suzanne Simard discusses the interconnected world beneath the forest floor, which connects trees in a way that allows them to communicate with one another, making the forest function as a single organism. She shares her personal story of growing up in the forests of British Columbia, where her grandfather, a horse logger, taught her about the ways of the woods, sparking her curiosity in the foundation of the forest. Studies in the laboratory showed the possibility of trees transmitting carbon below ground to each other, which she confirmed experimentally 25 years ago in the forests of British Columbia. This discovery proved controversial but ultimately led to a better understanding of the complex and intelligent world of the forest.

In this section, Suzanne Simard describes her experiment injecting carbon isotopes into bags containing birch and fir trees to test whether there was communication between the two species. She discovered that the two species were communicating through a massive belowground network, where they were exchanging carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, hormones, and other information. This mutualistic symbiosis was previously thought to occur through a mycorrhizal network, but Simardâ€™s research showed that communication was also happening directly between trees. She hopes that her discovery will lead to more sustainable forestry practices that recognize the cooperative nature of forests.

In this section of the video, scientist Suzanne Simard explains how trees are connected through mycorrhizal networks, which work like the Internet, with nodes and links connecting trees. Notably, mother trees or "hub trees," nurture the younger plants around them by sending them nutrients and carbon. Simard conducted experiments investigating whether the trees could recognize their kin, and it turns out that they do, colonizing them with larger mycorrhizal networks, and sending them more carbon and defense signals. Overall, forests are complex systems of interconnected trees with hubs and networks that overlap and connect, which makes them resilient, but also vulnerable to factors such as high-grade or clear-cut logging, which can cause the collapse of the entire system.

In this section, Suzanne Simard highlights the vulnerability of simplified forests lacking diversity which are susceptible to infections and bugs as climate change creates a perfect storm for extreme events, citing the massive mountain pine beetle outbreak that recently swept across North America and the megafire in Alberta. However, forests have an enormous capacity to self-heal as complex systems that can recover really rapidly. Suzanne recommends simple solutions such as re-establishing local involvement in forests, saving old-growth forests, saving legacies like mother trees and networks, and regenerating forests with a diversity of species, genotypes, and structures through planting and allowing natural regeneration while giving Mother Nature the tools she needs to use her intelligence to self-heal. Suzanne concludes with a reminder that forests are super-cooperators rather than competitive bunches of trees.
