In this section, Colin Powell talks about the importance of structure for young people, drawing on his experience with shaping recruits in the military. He shares how he makes school visits fun by inviting students to ask questions, but then makes them stand at attention and give their questions with clarity and confidence. The discipline and structure that Powell instills, which initially seems harsh, creates an environment in which young people develop skills and maturity, turning their initial frustration and hatred to respect for authority figures. This highlight on structure and discipline is necessary, Powell says, in the lives of children, ultimately builds respect, self-discipline, and personal responsibility.

In this section of the video, Colin Powell stresses the importance of structure, language and love early on in a child's life. The education process starts before a child is born and as soon as a child is in their mother's arms, there should be structure in their hearts and souls. A child who has not been read to or exposed to learning at an early age is in danger of not succeeding in school. According to Powell, children who have not received the proper start in life are candidates for jails at age 18, which is predictable by their third-grade reading level.
