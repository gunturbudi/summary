# Summary of 100 solutions to reverse global warming | Chad Frischmann

The 100 solutions to reversing global warming discussed in this video include things like replacing electric generation with clean renewable sources, reducing consumption, and increasing photosynthesis. Many of these solutions relate to the food system, land management, and electricity generation. Properly disposing of hydrofluorocarbons, increasing rooftop solar, regenerative agriculture, and protecting tropical forests are some of the top solutions. These solutions are achievable and have many benefits beyond just reversing global warming.

The 100 solutions to reversing global warming presented in this video include things like replacing electric generation with clean renewable sources, reducing consumption, and photosynthesis. Many of these solutions relate to the food system, land management, and electricity generation. Project Drawdown has outlined these solutions and detailed how they would be implemented over the next three decades in order to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.

The top solution for reversing global warming is refrigeration management, or properly disposing of hydrofluorocarbons, which are used by refrigerators and air conditioners to cool the air. This reduces emissions by up to 120 gigatons. Other solutions include rooftop solar, regenerative agriculture, and tropical forests.

Chad Frischmann discusses the benefits of adopting a plant-rich diet as one solution to reversing global warming, citing research that suggests this would produce enough food on current farmland to feed the world's growing population. He also mentions the importance of family planning and education for girls, which are all important in reducing the world's population. Finally, he notes that these solutions are achievable even if global warming is not a problem, as they have cascading benefits to human and planetary well-being.

Chad Frischmann provides 100 solutions to reverse global warming, which include regenerative agriculture, managed grazing, agroforestry, and silvopasture. These practices restore soil health, benefit farmers, and bring carbon back to the land. Protection of ecosystems also protects biodiversity and safeguards planetary health and oxygen that we breathe. These benefits to all species are incalculable, but the cost to implement these solutions is only $1 trillion over 30 years. We can do this if we want to, and the return on investment is huge.
