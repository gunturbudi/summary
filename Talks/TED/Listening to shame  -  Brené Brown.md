In this section, Brené Brown talks about her TEDxHouston talk where she discussed her research on vulnerability and open-hearted living. She shares her experience of experiencing a vulnerability hangover due to the fact that she had been very vulnerable throughout her TEDx talk, sharing her own stories of breakdown and imperfection. Brown discusses the myth that vulnerability equals weakness, arguing that it is instead a measure of courage and the possibility of open, honest human connection. She argues that while becoming vulnerable can be scary, it is also essential for whole-hearted living, and suggests that we should embrace vulnerability rather than trying to avoid it.

In this section of Brené Brown's "Listening to shame" video, Brown shares how, after the huge success of her TED Talk, many people asked her to speak at their events but asked her not to mention "vulnerability" or "shame." However, she explains that vulnerability is the birthplace of creativity, innovation, and change, and that adaptability to change is all about vulnerability. Moreover, Brown emphasizes that she could only learn about vulnerability and courage through studying shame, which she believes is the swampland of the soul. While she is not suggesting that people should live in shame, there is much to learn from honestly engaging with our shame rather than trying to hide or run away from it, and the courage to do so can lead to positive change.

In this section of her talk, Brené Brown addresses the idea that both men and women feel shame, but it's organised differently for each. For women, shame is a web of unobtainable, conflicting and competing expectations, leading them to believe they must do it all perfectly, never letting anyone see them sweat. For men, however, shame is simple; it is a case of being perceived as weak. Brown emphasises the need for empathy as the antidote to shame, and how vulnerability is essential to return to a state of empathy with one another.
