# Summary of Robert Full: Secrets of movement, from geckos and roaches

In this video, biomechanist Robert Full discusses the principles behind animal locomotion and how they can be used to inspire the design of robots and other products. Full examined the different mechanisms that animals use to move on various surfaces, including claws, distributed feet, spines, hairs, pads, glue, and capillary adhesion. He also talked about his research into geckos and roaches and how it led to the development of a self-cleaning dry adhesive and a climbing search-and-rescue robot named RiSE, which uses biologically-inspired feet and legs to climb any surface without suction or glue. Full emphasizes the importance of understanding nature's designs and preserving them to develop better engineering solutions.

In this section, Robert Full, a biomechanist, challenges viewers to help him create a biologically inspired 3D foot design, which he acknowledges is not an easy task. Full believes that in order to design a foot, people have to understand the principles of how feet work, and to do so, they must survey all the feet documented in literature. Full's research on the biomechanics of animal locomotion allowed him to create a blueprint for a foot, which is a synthesis of the secrets of many feet. Animals can move on a variety of substrates, varying in probability of contact, movement, and type of footholds. When examining how a foot works, Full had to simulate the conditions of these substrates and debris in order to observe the leg's behavior and how it contacts other parts of its leg more frequently than just the traditionally defined foot.

In this section, Robert Full discusses the concept of a distributed foot and its prevalence in nature, as demonstrated by animals such as cockroaches, octopuses, and shrimp-like stomatopods. He explains that this concept can inspire the design of robots, such as RHex, which uses a half-circle leg as a distributed foot to navigate challenging terrain. Full also discusses the role of spines in animal movement and how artificial spines can be added to robots for improved performance.

In this section, Robert Full discusses how animals use a variety of mechanisms, including claws, distributed feet, spines, hairs, pads, glue, and capillary adhesion, to move on different surfaces. To illustrate his point, he shows examples of animals such as ants, geckos, and lizards. The gecko's feet, in particular, inspire the design of the first self-cleaning dry adhesive using polyurethane. The adhesive has been tested to support significant loads and has generated interest for various potential applications.

In this section, Robert Full discusses how his curiosity-based research on the movement of geckos and roaches led to the development of a bio-inspired Band-Aid and a climbing search-and-rescue robot. The robot, named RiSE, has six legs and a tail and uses feet and toes that are as biologically inspired as the animal. The tuned structures of the feet, legs, and body allow it to climb any kind of surface without suction or glue. Full also emphasizes the importance of preserving nature's designs, as they provide novel principles that can lead to better engineering solutions.
