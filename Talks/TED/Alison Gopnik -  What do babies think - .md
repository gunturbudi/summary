# Summary of Alison Gopnik: What do babies think?

Alison Gopnik discusses the idea that babies are designed to learn, and how this evolutionary story would say that children are for learning. She discusses how babies' brains are the most powerful learning computers on the planet and how real computers are getting better. She then discusses how babies might be able to perform complex conditional probability calculations.

This video discusses how children's thinking is similar to that of the most brilliant scientists. Babies can understand what other people are thinking and feeling, and will often do what they think other people want in order to get what they want. This knowledge is usually acquired within the first three months of life.

Alison Gopnik discusses the findings of her research into how babies use statistics to understand the world. She shows how four year olds use evidence to come up with hypotheses that are unlikely, and how adults do not perform as well.

Psychologists and philosophers have long debated whether babies and young children are conscious, but Alison Gopnik believes they are in fact more conscious than adults. Gopnik argues that adults' attention and consciousness look like a spotlight, while babies' attention and consciousness look like a lantern. The prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for executive functions such as decision-making and planning, sends a signal that makes the brain more flexible and plastic. Babies are good at taking in lots of information from multiple sources, but they can't focus on just one thing. Coffee, which has been shown to have similar effects to baby neurotransmitters, helps grownups to have a "taste" of baby consciousness.
