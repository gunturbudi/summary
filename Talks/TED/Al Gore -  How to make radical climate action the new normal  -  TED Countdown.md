# Summary of Al Gore: How to make radical climate action the new normal | TED Countdown

Former Vice President Al Gore speaks about the gravity of the current climate crisis, stating that human-caused global warming pollution has impacted our planet's thin atmospheric layer and has accumulated an enormous amount of heat, leading to widespread damages and disproportionate victimization of people of color and those in poverty. He highlights the urgency of shifting to sustainable practices, advocating for multistakeholder capitalism that focuses on a "value spectrum" beyond short-term profits, in order to combat climate change. Gore emphasizes the power of emergent social movements and encourages viewers to view the fight against climate change as the biggest movement in history, reminding us that political will is a renewable resource.

In this section, Al Gore emphasizes the gravity of the climate crisis, which poses a severe collision between human society and Earth's ecological systems, primarily our planet's thin atmospheric layer. Human-caused global warming pollution, mostly from fossil fuel burning and agricultural activities, has accumulated and traps an enormous amount of heat, equivalent to 600,000 Hiroshima-class atomic bombs exploding each day. As a result, sea levels are rising, ocean temperatures are increasing, and extreme weather events, like atmospheric rivers and rain bombs, are becoming widespread and inflicting damages on communities worldwide, disproportionately victimizing people of color and those in poverty. These catastrophes may lead to the displacement of billions of people and trigger the rise of authoritarianism, causing a series of disconcerting events that may leave a haunting legacy for humanity.

In this section, Al Gore discusses how the severe heat caused by the climate crisis is creating the worst droughts in history, leading to food insecurity and the evaporation of reservoirs in places like California, Brazil, and Eastern Europe. He also highlights how the increased heat is leading to the worst wildfires, such as those in California, in history. Gore stresses that these conditions cannot become the new normal and cites the lightning strike hitting a natural gas leak in the Gulf of Mexico as one of the many causes of concern for the climate crisis. He emphasizes how inequitably distributed solutions to the climate crisis are, despite the recent rise of renewables, which have become the cheapest source of energy in the world. Gore puts the spotlight on the oil and gas industry's lack of investment in clean energy despite its growing profitability in contrast to the falling-profitability of the oil and gas industry, which has been the worst investment in global markets for more than a decade.

In this section, Al Gore discusses the need to shift to sustainability in order to combat climate change. He emphasizes that the sustainability revolution presents a significant business opportunity, but that current versions of capitalism must be reformed. To this end, we need to expand our focus to include a "value spectrum" beyond short-term profits for one stakeholder, incorporating externalities such as environmental and social impacts. Gore advocates for multistakeholder capitalism, which is already driving new decisions in asset management, including a commitment to net-zero portfolios. Gore points out that reaching net-zero will allow us to stop the climate crisis and start the healing process, but that we all need to work together and take immediate action to make it happen.

In this section of the video, Al Gore emphasizes the power of social movements and their ability to drive change on a global scale. Drawing parallels to historical movements such as the civil rights movement and anti-apartheid movement, Gore encourages viewers to view the fight against climate change as an "emergent social movement" that has the potential to be the biggest in history. He concludes by reminding us that political will is a renewable resource, implying that leaders who lack the courage to tackle climate change can and will be replaced by those who do.
