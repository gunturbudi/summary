# Summary of 3 Money Lessons from Infamous Scam Artists | J Mase III | TED

In this TED Talk, J Mase III explores how scam artists can teach us lessons about money in society. The speaker discusses examples such as Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos, Margaret and Walter Keane, and Anna Delvey to highlight how social identities and performative wealth impact investment decisions. J Mase III argues that the real scam lies in the way society deals with money and how big corporations exploit workers in legal ways. They urge the audience to consider the scams we overlook in our daily lives and to envision a world where resources are allocated based on community care and ethics rather than using money to prove morality, competency, or wisdom.

In this section, the speaker expresses their fascination with scam artists and how we can learn from them about how money functions in society. They share their experience working as a professional artist and fundraising through grants and consulting with philanthropic organizations. The speaker then discusses Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, and how she was able to raise billions of dollars for a product that did not work. The speaker points out that despite obvious red flags surrounding the company, many investors rationalized their decision to invest in Theranos. The speaker's first lesson is that people with wealth aren't necessarily better at making decisions and they get to make more bad decisions without consequences, causing harm to others.

In this section, the speaker discusses how the story of Margaret and Walter Keane teaches us that in an unjust society, social identities are often used as markers to decide whether individuals are worthy of being taken seriously or deserving of financial and other resources. The speaker shares a story of Carlette Duffy, a Black woman who had to remove all signs of her Black identity from her home to get her house appraised at its true value. The story of Anna Delvey highlights how those who are seen as being able to perform wealth are more likely to get funded than those in actual financial need.

In this section of the video, J Mase III argues that the real scam in our society is the way we deal with money. He highlights examples of how big corporations such as JPMorgan Chase, Apple, and Amazon exploit workers in different ways and how it is legal to pay disabled workers and essential workers less than minimum wage. He urges the audience to consider the scams that we are asked to overlook in our daily lives and to dream of a world where we delegate resources from a place of community care and ethics rather than using money to prove morality, competency, or wisdom.
