# Summary of How do we heal medicine? | Atul Gawande

Atul Gawande, a surgeon and writer, discusses the evolution of medicine and asserts that the current structure built around courage, independence, and self-sufficiency has become a disaster. Instead, he suggests that the structured coordination of a pit crew is needed for physicians, in which every member has a specific role to play, reducing incomplete or inappropriate care and reducing the costs of care. By creating systems that work, we can recognize success and failure and devise solutions. Gawande also shares the success of implementing checklists in surgical teams, which led to reduced complication and death rates, but highlights the resistance towards using checklists, which challenge values such as independence and autonomy. Ultimately, Gawande believes that making systems work is the challenge for our generation as a whole, and complexity requires group success.

In this section, Atul Gawande, a surgeon and writer, talks about the evolution of medicine, starting from when it was cheap but ineffective to now where it is extremely complex but expensive. He explains how medicine started with a core structure where if you had a prescription pad, a nurse, and a hospital, you could do everything. With the advances of science, medicine became more sophisticated, and now there's a deepening crisis due to the cost of healthcare. The answer is not just the government or insurance companies but the complexity that science has given us.

In this section, Atul Gawande discusses the evolution of medicine and how the current structure built around courage, independence, and self-sufficiency has become a disaster. With 4,000 medical and surgical procedures and 6,000 licensed drugs, physicians can no longer function independently and must rely on specialists and other clinicians to provide adequate patient care. Gawande suggests that what is needed is not cowboy-like independence among physicians but the structured coordination of a pit crew, in which every member has a specific role to play. Such a structure would not only reduce incomplete or inappropriate care but could also lower the costs of care. Finally, Gawande points out that the most expensive care is not necessarily the best care, and the best care is often the least expensive, providing hope that cost and quality of care can be improved.

In this section, Atul Gawande talks about how the best results in medicine are achieved not by using the most expensive care in the world, but by creating systems that work. He uses the example of how components alone are not enough to make things work, but they need to be put together in a system. Gawande also discusses two skills that systems have - the ability to recognize success and failure, and to devise solutions. He says that in order to tackle high-risk industries like surgery, we need to learn from other industries like aviation, and implement tools such as checklists to help experts handle complexity.

In this section, Atul Gawande explains how his team created a 19-item two-minute checklist for surgical teams, including making sure an antibiotic is given in the right time frame and ensuring all members of the team introduce themselves by name. After implementing the checklist in eight hospitals around the world, they found that the complication rates fell by 35 percent, and the death rates fell by 47 percent. However, there is a deep resistance to using checklists, as it forces people to behave differently and embrace values such as humility, discipline, and teamwork, which are opposite to those of independence, self-sufficiency, and autonomy. Gawande suggests that making systems work is the challenge for our generation as a whole and that complexity requires group success.
