# Summary of Ellen Dunham-Jones: Retrofitting suburbia

Ellen Dunham-Jones argues that retrofitting suburbia is necessary to combat climate change, sedentary lifestyles, and affordability issues. The shift in suburban demographics presents an opportunity for developers to re-inhabit and redevelop underperforming parking lots and malls into mixed-use developments that include food and community gathering spaces. Retrofitting projects have been implemented in different areas, including a restoration of a Minneapolis shopping center to its original wetlands. Dunham-Jones encourages metropolitan scale retrofitting and calls for people to demand more sustainable suburban places and support zoning changes, infrastructure improvements, and retrofits.

In this section, Ellen Dunham-Jones argues that retrofitting suburbia is crucial due to unintended consequences such as climate change, sedentary lifestyles, and affordability. She explains that suburbanites drive more, which increases their carbon footprint, and that sedentary lifestyles caused by suburban development patterns have led to rising obesity rates and associated health issues. Additionally, she notes that transportation costs are a significant expense for many residents and can wipe out savings promised by affordable housing options. Dunham-Jones believes that retrofitting suburbia is practical and has found over 80 varied projects that are market-driven, with major demographic shifts being the main driving force.

In this section, Ellen Dunham-Jones discusses the shift in suburban demographics and the need to retrofit suburbia accordingly. With the Baby Boomers retiring and Generation Y yet to hit child-rearing age, the demand for more urban lifestyles within suburbia is growing. Furthermore, the underperforming asphalt of suburban parking lots and dead malls offers developers the opportunity for re-inhabitation and redevelopment, with examples including art spaces, nursing homes, schools, and libraries. Food and community gathering spaces, like a gourmet grocery and restaurant, are especially popular for retrofitting suburban strip malls, and the most dramatic retrofits involve redevelopment into walkable, urban neighborhoods.

In this section, we see examples of retrofit projects that have been implemented in different parts of the US. Examples include the gradual transformation of a strip shopping center in New England into a mixed-use village, an infill project on an office park outside of Washington DC, and a retrofit of a mall that has been transformed into an urban neighborhood in Colorado. Retrofitting can be prompted by transit expansions or the success of a retrofit project in a nearby area. The goal of these retrofits is to create walkable, livable environments while also preserving and re-greening the local ecology. While the retrofitting process occurs incrementally, it is starting to expand from pockets of walkability to include larger corridors for transformation.

In this section, Ellen Dunham-Jones highlights some examples of suburbia retrofitting, including a Minneapolis shopping center that was restored to its original wetlands, attracting private investment and restoring the local economy and ecology. She encourages retrofitting on a metropolitan scale to target which areas should be re-greened or redeveloped, and to improve the design quality of these retrofits. Additionally, she calls for people to demand more sustainable suburban places and to support zoning changes, road diets, infrastructure improvements, and retrofits near them to allow the suburbs to "grow up" and become more sustainable.
