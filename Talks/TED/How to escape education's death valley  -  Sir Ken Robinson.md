In this section of the video, Sir Ken Robinson criticizes the education system in America, particularly the "No Child Left Behind" legislation that has left millions of children behind and resulted in high dropout rates, especially in Native American communities. He argues that this crisis should be solved, not by spending more money or reducing class sizes, but by addressing the underlying principles of the education system. He highlights the first principle that human beings are naturally different and diverse, contrary to the conformity-based education system that prioritizes STEM disciplines and neglects art, humanities, and physical education.

In this section, Sir Ken Robinson critiques the common misdiagnosis of kids as suffering from Attention Deficit Disorder (ADHD) when the real issue is that they don't have a proper early childhood education. Children are more often just suffering from childhood because they can't sit for prolonged periods and focus on low-grade clerical work. A broad curriculum that uses different talents should celebrate kids. The arts, in particular, are essential since they help children's overall well-being. Children's curiosity is another driving principle of human life flourishing, and they are natural learners. Teachers are the lifeblood of success, but they have become de-professionalized. Ideally, teaching is not a delivery system and has a mentor, stimulate, provoke, and engage role. Education should focus more on learning than testing, and instead of curiosity, student compliance is encouraged through routine algorithms rather than intriguing imagination and creativity.

In this section, Sir Ken Robinson discusses the importance of creativity and the problem with the culture of standardization in education. He highlights Finlandâ€™s success in education, which includes a very broad approach that includes humanities, physical education, and the arts. Robinson believes that individualized teaching and learning, attributing a high status to the teaching profession, and devolving responsibility to the school level for getting the job done are key aspects needed to improve the American education system. He argues that education is a human system, not a mechanical one, and that current policies based on mechanistic conceptions of education will not help it improve.

In this section, Sir Ken Robinson discusses alternative education programs designed to help students who have dropped out of school to get back into education. He describes the common features of these programs as being personalized, with strong support for teachers and links to the community, as well as broad and diverse curriculums that involve students outside of school as well. Interestingly, Robinson notes that if all schools followed these principles, there would be no need for alternative education programs. He believes that leadership in education should focus on climate control, creating a climate of possibility, and encouraging people to move to bring about change. He encourages the audience to join a movement that will make a revolution in the education system.
