# Summary of Hackers: the internet's immune system | Keren Elazari

Keren Elazari's TED talk emphasizes the importance of hackers in identifying vulnerabilities and threats in technology systems and how they can act as the "immune system" for the information age, detecting problematic issues that we might not otherwise notice. She discusses the practice of full disclosure in the hacker community and the positive impact of hackers on revolutions using technology to bring people together. She also talks about how hackers can challenge overreaching governments and data-hoarding corporates, and we need to see them as heroes who have impacted civil liberties, innovation, and Internet freedom.

In this section, Keren Elazari highlights the important role that hackers can play in identifying vulnerabilities and threats in technology systems. She describes how hackers like Barnaby Jack, who famously demonstrated that ATMs could be made to "jackpot" by exploiting software vulnerabilities, can act as the "immune system" for the information age, detecting and making us aware of problems that we might not otherwise notice. She also emphasizes the responsibility that comes with great power, acknowledging that while some hackers use their skills to cause harm, others can make valuable contributions by finding and fixing security flaws.

In this section, the speaker discusses the controversial practice of full disclosure in the hacker community. She narrates how Khalil, a Palestinian hacker from the West Bank, discovered a serious privacy flaw on Facebook and tried to report it through the company's bug bounty program but was denied his reward as he didn't report it properly. Finally, a group of hackers raised more than $13,000 to reward him for his discovery, raising a crucial question about coming up with incentives for hackers to do the right thing. The speaker also mentions Anonymous, the leading brand of global hacktivism, who have gone after many targets from corrupt politicians to popes and uncovered corruption and abuse through the internet. She concludes that we must embrace hacker culture despite the challenges it brings as the alternative is going against the power we cannot control and stifling innovation by regulating knowledge.

In this section, the speaker highlights the positive impact of hackers by exploring their influence on revolutions that use technology to bring people together. During Egypt's revolution in 2011, hackers from groups like Telecomix assisted protestors in breaking through censorship barricades using analog dial-up lines, demonstrating the power of technology and resourcefulness in achieving progress. However, the sinister potential of hacking is also unveiled when discussing the actions of the Syrian Electronic Army, who used fake news to expose markets that caused a drop in the Dow Jones index and led to considerable financial losses. Generally, the government's complicated relationship with hackers is touched upon, whereby they attempt to regulate their powers through broad surveillance programs but also see their potential as an untapped talent base.

In this section, Keren Elazari talks about how hackers are the ones capable of challenging the overreaching governments and data-hoarding corporates on their own playing field. She believes that after all, it is not information but the people who want to be free, and hackers play a significant role in achieving that freedom. Their compulsion to either exploit or change things forces us to fix vulnerabilities, demand better, and continuously improve the rapidly changing world. Therefore, she argues that we need to change our portrayal of them as bad guys and see them as the heroes who have impacted civil liberties, innovation, and Internet freedom.
