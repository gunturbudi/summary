# Summary of How we can design timeless cities for our collective future | Vishaan Chakrabarti

In this video, Vishaan Chakrabarti discusses how the sameness of modern cities is created by regulations and mass production that prioritize safety and functionality over beauty and uniqueness. He argues that designing great cities is crucial for our survival as a species, and proposes solutions such as replicating local markets, using technology to promote human-centered design, and focusing on sustainability and affordability. Chakrabarti also presents his work on a sustainable, affordable, and culturally relevant open-air village in Mongolia as an example of how we can build cities that respond to local needs and protect nature while fostering technological advancements.

In this section, the speaker questions why modern cities lack the charm of older cities and suburbs, and why this sameness matters. He argues that most people around the world are moving to urban areas, and how we design these areas will determine if we survive as a species. The speaker unpacks how we got here in the first place, citing mass production and regulation as culprits. Regulations designed for pedestrian safety, fire safety, and wheelchair access inadvertently made illegal the ways we used to build cities. The speaker argues that great cities have distinctive appeal and are powerful magnets that attract people.

In this section, the speaker discusses how the constant demand for bigger and more cost-effective buildings to accommodate the need for infrastructure like elevators and fire stairs is creating sameness at the expense of communal living and affordability, while a fear of difference and a perceived need for safety are perpetuating homogeneity. He proposes that we focus on replicating local and niche markets, making technology work for us, and having a more human-centered design, citing examples like autonomous vehicles that can coexist safely with pedestrians and cobblestone streets that produce kinetic energy to encourage walking and promote fitness.

In this section, Vishaan Chakrabarti discusses his work on the design of a 21st-century open-air village in the city of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, that is sustainably heated using today's technology. The project involves the development of a catalogue of small buildings that are affordable and use local construction materials and technology to provide new forms of housing, workspace, shops, and cultural buildings. Chakrabarti believes that by building cities that respond to local communities, climates, and construction methods, we can accommodate all income groups and protect nature while promoting technological advancements and timeless cultural needs.
