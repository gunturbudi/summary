# Summary of The Ocean's Ingenious Climate Solutions | Susan Ruffo | TED Countdown

Susan Ruffo discusses the potential solutions that the ocean offers for the climate crisis. She notes that the ocean is saving us by regulating temperature and absorbing CO2 and excess heat, and suggests that we need to protect and restore coastal ocean ecosystems and use the ocean to help us in the fight against climate change. Ruffo presents solutions such as using reefs as natural defenses, harnessing the ocean's energy to produce carbon-free energy, and using kelp to sequester carbon and create plastic alternatives. She emphasizes the importance of integrating the ocean into our strategies to combat climate change.

In this section, the speaker notes that the ocean is a necessary part of our planet's ecosystem. While we typically consider how we can save the ocean from harm, we need to remember that the ocean is actually saving us by regulating temperature and absorbing CO2 and excess heat. As a result, we need to start thinking about how we can use the ocean to help us in the fight against climate change. For example, we need to protect and restore coastal ocean ecosystems, such as mangroves and salt marshes, which are some of the most effective carbon sinks on the planet. Additionally, oysters can help to reduce the risk of major floods and flood damage in coastal communities.

In this section, Susan Ruffo presents the ocean's potential solutions for the climate crisis. She explains how reefs work as natural defenses that slow down water and reduce its power, while also creating aquatic parks and habitats that benefit both wildlife and people. Ruffo suggests that we could harness the ocean's wind, waves, and tides to produce carbon-free energy, and plan and design these systems so that they support wildlife, aquaculture, and carbon sequestration. Another solution she presents is using kelp to sequester carbon, feed animals, and create plastic alternatives. Ruffo emphasizes the importance of considering the ocean as a powerful source of solutions that we should integrate into our strategies to combat climate change.
