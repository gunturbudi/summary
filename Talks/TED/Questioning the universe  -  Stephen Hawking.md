# Summary of Questioning the universe | Stephen Hawking

Stephen Hawking discusses the possibility of spontaneous creation of the universe through the laws of evolution and how the distinction between time and space no longer exists due to general relativity and quantum theory. He also talks about the likelihood of extraterrestrial life based on observational evidence but discounts reports of UFOs and lack of contact with intelligent civilizations within proximity to Earth. He believes our aggressive instincts continue to pose a threat to our survival and that space exploration is our best chance for survival. Lastly, he touches upon his quest for understanding the universe and finding answers to the big questions.

In this section, Stephen Hawking discusses the origins of the universe and how we have made progress on understanding the laws of evolution of the universe, but until recently, we had little idea about the initial conditions. He explains how general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space, removing the distinction between the two, which means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state, allowing the universe to spontaneously create itself out of nothing. Further, Hawking talks about the possibility of alien life in the universe, stating that we believe life arose spontaneously on Earth, so it must be possible for it to appear on other suitable planets. Two pieces of observational evidence suggest that the probability of life appearing is reasonably high, but since we haven't been visited by aliens, we can't be sure if there is life beyond Earth.

In this section, Stephen Hawking discusses the possibility of extraterrestrial life and why it is unlikely that there are intelligent civilizations within a few hundred light years from Earth. He discounts the reports of UFOs and speculates that if there were aliens with advanced technology visiting Earth, they would not appear only to "cranks and weirdos." He also mentions that despite an extensive search for extraterrestrial life by the SETI project, we have not heard any alien television quiz shows. Stephen Hawking believes that our aggressive instincts that were advantageous for survival in the past continue to pose a threat to our long-term survival as a species, and our best chance for survival is to spread out into space. Lastly, he touches upon his quest to understand the universe and find answers to the big questions.
