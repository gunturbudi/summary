# Summary of How the James Webb Space Telescope Will Unfold the Universe | John C. Mather | TED

John C. Mather explains the amazing engineering feats behind the James Webb Space Telescope, which launched on Christmas morning of 2021. The telescope is equipped with a 21-foot hexagonal mirror coated in gold that reflects infrared light and is protected by a five-layer metalized plastic sunshade. The telescope had to be folded up like origami to fit into the rocket for launch and took two weeks to unfold panels that held the sunshade in place. The telescope's purpose is to explore many different phenomena in space, including searching for planets around other stars that might have life and examining places where stars are born through dust using an infrared camera, among others.

In this section, the speaker discusses the James Webb Space Telescope and its incredible engineering accomplishments. The telescope, which launched on Christmas morning of 2021, has a 21-foot hexagonal mirror coated in gold that reflects infrared light and is protected by a five-layer metalized plastic sunshade. The telescope had to be folded up like origami to fit into the rocket for launch and took two weeks to unfold panels that held the sunshade in place. The telescope was sent to a place called Lagrange Point 2, a million miles from the Sun, and was focused to take pictures of the same star taken by the Spitzer Space Telescope, where the new Webb telescope was able to capture a sharp image.

In this section, John C. Mather discusses the various phenomena in space that will be explored by the James Webb Space Telescope. These include examining places where stars are born through the dust using an infrared camera, exploring Mars and Europa, observing Titan where a probe will be sent and could land with a helicopter, and searching for planets around other stars that might have life. Mather also talks about how the telescope will be able to detect the chemistry of other planet's atmospheres and potentially discover if there are Earth-like planets around stars like our Sun.
