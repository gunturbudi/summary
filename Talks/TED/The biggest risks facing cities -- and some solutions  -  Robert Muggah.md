# Summary of The biggest risks facing cities -- and some solutions | Robert Muggah

Robert Muggah discusses the risks facing cities, including violence, pollution, and climate change, and proposes some solutions. Fragility occurs when the social contract of a city is weakened by poverty, youth unemployment, and natural disasters. Cities need to find their political voice to address these issues and prevent collapse. Muggah also highlights the threat of migration caused by environmental factors and the dire situation of refugees and internally displaced people worldwide. He outlines six principles that cities can adopt to combat the risks associated with rapid urbanization, stressing the importance of strategic planning and governance, green investments, integrated and multi-use solutions, sustainable building practices, and working together in global coalitions.

In this section, Robert Muggah warns about the risks that cities face and offers some solutions. While cities offer many benefits, they also have a dark side with issues such as violence, car accidents, and pollution. Additionally, cities are responsible for over 75% of our energy consumption and emit 80% of our greenhouse gases. Muggah explains that fragility occurs when the social contract of a city comes unstuck and that the convergence of multiple risks such as poverty, youth unemployment, and exposure to natural disasters can make a city more fragile. The visualization shows that fragility is deepening in vulnerable areas such as North Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and Central Asia. Muggah emphasizes that cities need to find their political voice to address these issues and prevent collapse.

In this section, the speaker discusses the issue of migration caused by environmental factors such as droughts and the resulting social unrest, and the dire situation of over 22 million refugees and 36 million internally displaced people worldwide. He also highlights the threat of climate change, particularly sea level rise, to coastal cities and their inhabitants, who must either adapt or face the consequences. Cities that have already suffered from natural disasters, such as Miami, Port-au-Prince, and New Orleans, are a warning of what is to come. The speaker also presents a glimmer of hope through examples of protected areas and climate commitments undertaken by cities around the globe.

In this section, urban specialist Robert Muggah outlines six principles that cities can adopt to combat the risks associated with rapid urbanization: strategic planning and governance, green investments, integrated and multi-use solutions, sustainable and inclusive building practices, and finally, a willingness to borrow good ideas from other cities. Muggah stresses the importance of cities having a plan in place and the role of urban governance, citing Singapore's 50-year urban strategy as an example. He also discusses the need for cities to invest in sustainable energy and infrastructure, while embracing dense but inclusive building practices to avoid urban sprawl. Muggah highlights the success of Seoul's public transportation system and Medell√≠n's hydroelectric plant as examples of integrated solutions that are both sustainable and effective.

In this section, the speaker emphasizes the importance of cities working together in global coalitions to amplify their voices and exert their own sovereignty. By borrowing ideas and technologies from one another, cities can lead the way in addressing the biggest risks they face, from climate change to inequality. As multilateral institutions and nation-states struggle to act in uncertain times, cities and their leaders are becoming the new visionaries of the 21st century and deserve a seat at the table.
