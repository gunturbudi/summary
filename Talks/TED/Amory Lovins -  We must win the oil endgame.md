# Summary of Amory Lovins: We must win the oil endgame

Amory Lovins argues that we can achieve the oil endgame without significantly impacting the economy by replacing half of the oil we use with advanced biofuels and safe natural gas. This would save $70 billion each year, create over a million good jobs, and get returns of over $150 billion annually. Lovins also discusses how advances in materials, such as carbon-fiber composites, have allowed for the creation of safer and lighter cars, and how the military can create advanced materials-industrial clusters and a civilian economy that can shift towards more sustainable energy sources. Adopting these strategies, the US could be oil-free by the 2040s while greatly reducing oil imports, providing more job opportunities, and benefiting national and global security.

In this section, Amory Lovins argues that the new story about climate protection is that it's profitable and not costly. Many companies, including Dupont, IBM, and others, are reducing their energy intensity by fixing up their facilities, and they get their money back in two to three years. Saving fuel is cheaper than buying fuel, and the same theory applies to oil. Lovins believes that the United States can completely eliminate its use of oil and rejuvenate the economy by using profit-maximizing capitalists to save and substitute oil. This process will also be catalyzed by the military, particularly over oil, for combat effectiveness and preventing conflict.

In this section of the video, Amory Lovins explains how we can achieve the oil endgame without significantly impacting the economy. He proposes an investment of $180 billion where half of it would go towards retooling the car, truck, and plane industries, and the other half to build the advanced bio-fuel industry. By replacing half the oil we use with advanced biofuels and safe natural gas, we can save $70 billion each year. It will also create over a million good jobs, protect a million jobs at risk, and get returns of over $150 billion annually. Lovins also presents an example of how light vehicles, heavy trucks, and planes can be made more energy-efficient, and how reducing the weight of cars can help us save more energy.

In this section, Amory Lovins talks about how advances in materials, specifically carbon-fiber composites, have allowed for the creation of safer and lighter cars. These materials can absorb six to 12 times as much energy per pound as steel, making them more energy-efficient and effective in absorbing crash energy. These materials could make bigger cars both protective and light, saving money and lives in the process. Lovins also discusses advancements in the design of quintupled-efficiency suburban-assault vehicles, which use complex shapes made of stiff carbon-composite materials that can be easily assembled without the need for a body or paint shop, making the manufacturing process easier and more cost-effective. Finally, Lovins covers several options for addressing projected oil requirements by 2025, including increased efficiency, increased use of cellulosic ethanol, and hydrogen fuel.

In this section, Amory Lovins suggests ways to make low-emission vehicles more affordable and accessible to low-income families, which would create a new market for automakers and enable greater opportunity and job access across different racial groups. Lovins also highlights the role of governments in purchasing large amounts of efficient vehicles, and the potential for offering X Prize-style incentives to accelerate the transition to green technology. He also discusses the military's ability to create advanced materials-industrial clusters and civilian economy that can shift away from hydrocarbons and towards more sustainable energy sources. By adopting these strategies and implementing them at slower rates, Lovins argues that the US could be oil-free by the 2040s while also greatly reducing oil imports, providing more job opportunities, and benefiting national and global security.
