# Summary of How to get empowered, not overpowered, by AI | Max Tegmark

Max Tegmark discusses the power and potential of artificial intelligence (AI), highlighting that AI can accomplish complex tasks and may eventually reach artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, he also stresses the importance of investing in AI safety research to ensure that AI is aligned with human values, and to prevent harm or hacking. Tegmark discusses the potential dangers of uncontrolled advancements in AI, but also believes that a carefully developed AI guided by ethical standards and human values can lead to a fantastic future where everyone is better off. Ultimately, Tegmark argues that we need to be ambitious in our approach to AI to create an age of amazement where we are empowered, not overpowered, by our technology.

In this section, Max Tegmark discusses the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential to accomplish complex goals. Tegmark defines intelligence inclusively, including both biological and artificial intelligence. He points out the tremendous progress made recently in AI, with robots now capable of backflips, self-flying rockets, face recognition, and defeating human AI researchers in the game of Go and even chess. He illustrates the potential of AI through the use of a landscape of tasks where the elevation represents the difficulty of the task and the sea level represents what AI can do today, with the sea level rising as AI improves. He raises the question of whether AI will eventually rise to flood everything and match human intelligence at all tasks, referred to as artificial general intelligence.

In this section, Tegmark discusses the possibility of achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which could lead to transformative change in society if we manage to take full advantage of the benefits of it. He also talks about the potential of an intelligence explosion, where AI progress could be way faster than human capability and lead to superintelligence. To steer the AI towards a future where it will help humanity flourish, Tegmark believes that we face a wisdom race where we need to manage our technology with growing wisdom. To achieve this, safety engineering should be practised where we carefully consider what can go wrong to get things right the first time. To promote good technology use, Tegmark has been promoting the 23 AI safety principles that limit any arms race of lethal autonomous weapons.

In this section, Max Tegmark discusses the importance of investing in AI safety research to transform today's vulnerable systems into strong and reliable ones that can be trusted, to prevent harm or hacking that can be turned against humans. He stressed the need for AI value alignment, as machines can accomplish goals that are not aligned with humans, and it's our job to figure out how to make machines understand, adopt, and retain human goals. Tegmark highlights the importance of considering the destination of AI beyond the current short-term challenges. He outlines the potential for superintelligence to help life spread in the cosmos but highlights the significant disagreement around who or what should be in charge, with some advocating for human control, while others preferring the concept of friendly AI that treats us well due to its alignment with human values.

In this section, Max Tegmark discusses the potential dangers of uncontrolled advancements in AI and the need for careful navigation to ensure a brighter future. He believes that if AI is left unprepared, it could create unprecedented inequality, surveillance, and suffering or even human extinction. However, if AI is carefully developed, guided by ethical standards and human values, it could create a fantastic future where everyone is better off. Tegmark argues that we need to be ambitious in our approach to AI, and that should lead to the creation of an age of amazement where we are empowered rather than overpowered by our technology.
