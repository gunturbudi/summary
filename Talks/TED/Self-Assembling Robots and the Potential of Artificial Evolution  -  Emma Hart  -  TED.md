# Summary of Self-Assembling Robots and the Potential of Artificial Evolution | Emma Hart | TED

Emma Hart discusses the potential of self-assembling robots created through artificial evolution, which would allow for the robots to be uniquely adapted to their environments and optimized over time. The robots are produced using a digital version of DNA and 3D printing, and are scored on their ability to perform tasks to mimic natural selection. This technology could enable the creation of more complex structures without an engineering blueprint and reduce the ecological footprint of robots, but requires responsible development and regulation.

In this section, Emma Hart discusses a technology that enables robots to be created, reproduce and evolve over long periods of time, where robot design and fabrication becomes a task for machines rather than humans. The technology is intended to produce robots that are uniquely adapted to the environments that they find themselves in, where they can be designed and optimized. It imitates biological evolution using a computer program to breed better solutions to problems over time, and robots can be guided by humans or operate completely autonomously. However, it is more difficult to evolve robots than passive objects such as tables since they require brains in addition to bodies to make sense of their environment and exhibit appropriate behaviors. Surprisingly, evolution only needs three ingredients: physical variations, reproduction, and mutation inheritance.

In this section, Emma Hart discusses the potential of artificial evolution in the creation and optimization of self-assembling robots. The process starts by designing a digital version of DNA, which serves as the blueprint for the robot's body, brain, sensory mechanisms, and movement. The robots are then produced using a mix of hardware and software, with the physical production process aided by 3D printing and automated assembly arms. To mimic natural selection, the robots are scored on their ability to perform tasks, and selective reproduction of these robots occurs to create successive generations. Although relatively slow due to the 3D printing process, a virtual population of robots is created in a computer simulation to further explore the potential of different robot types. Ultimately, artificial evolution could help reduce the ecological footprint of robots on Earth and push the boundaries of exoplanetary exploration.

In this section, Emma Hart discusses how self-assembling robots have the potential to change the traditional design process by allowing for the creation of more complex structures without the need for an engineering blueprint. She explains how artificial evolution allows robots to continually adapt and improve upon their design, resulting in more efficient and effective structures. However, she also acknowledges the ethical concerns that may arise from using artificial evolution and emphasizes the need for responsible development and regulation of this technology.
