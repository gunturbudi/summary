# Summary of What makes a friendship last? | Am I Normal? with Mona Chalabi

Mona Chalabi explores why friendships fail and how they can be maintained in the "Am I Normal?" series. Studies show that friendships often dissolve due to a lack of opportunity to meet, hang out, and connect, with half of our friendships ending every seven years. However, it takes time to make new friends, with at least 200 hours needed for someone to become a best friend. Despite requiring effort, treasured friends will always be there, regardless of the distance or time spent apart.

In this section, Mona Chalabi looks at studies on why friendships fall apart and how they can be sustained. According to a study, friendships often dissolve due to a lack of opportunity to meet, hang out, and connect. The same study also discovered that we lose half of our friendships every seven years, although the size of our friendship group actually remains consistent over seven years' time. However, over seven years, 52 percent of the people in our network will change. Moreover, it takes time to make new friends - between 40 and 60 hours to go from an acquaintance to a casual friend and at least 200 hours for someone to become a best friend. Mona concludes that while making new friendships requires effort, special friends will always be there regardless of the distance or time apart.
