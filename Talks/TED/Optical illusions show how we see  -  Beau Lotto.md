# Summary of Optical illusions show how we see | Beau Lotto

Beau Lotto demonstrates how optical illusions show how we see the world in this video. He explains that the brain sees the same information in different ways depending on where it is looking. This is true for color, motion, and even complex perceptions like perspective. The video then discusses how Beau Lotto works with bumblebees in his lab, and how he can control their experience to see how it alters the architecture of their brain.

In this video, Beau Lotto discusses how the human brain sees color. He explains that the brain sees color based on the amount of light that an object reflects, as well as the color of the surrounding space. He also says that the meaning of sensory information is determined by the person interpreting it.

In this optical illusion video, Beau Lotto shows how we see the world by demonstrating how illusions create understanding of the world. The senses are not fragile, and color tells us something completely different--that the brain didn't evolve to see the world the way it is. Instead, the brain evolved to see the world the way it was useful to see in the past. This allows us to explore how people literally make sense of the world by translating light into sound.

In this optical illusion video, Beau Lotto demonstrates how the position of the middle nine surfaces in a room can affect the perception of light coming through them. The surfaces on the right appear yellowish under a purplish light, while the surfaces on the left appear purplish under a yellow light. However, the middle nine surfaces are physically the same and look different to the viewer.
