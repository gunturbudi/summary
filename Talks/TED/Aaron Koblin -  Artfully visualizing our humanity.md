# Summary of Aaron Koblin: Artfully visualizing our humanity

Aaron Koblin presents several of his art projects that focus on visualizing data in creative ways, such as Flight Patterns which displays airplane traffic and the web service Mechanical Turk that taps into the minds of thousands of people to solve problems. He also talks about his collaborative music-making projects, including the Johnny Cash Project where users submit individual frames to create a music video, and The Wilderness Downtown which creates a personalized music video using Google maps and Street View images. These projects showcase how data visualization and interfaces can be used to tell powerful stories and create socially relevant art.

In this section, Aaron Koblin discusses how the presentation of data is an opportunity for us to make amazing interfaces that tell great stories. He presents several projects he has been working on that focus on visualizing our lives and systems through data. One project, Flight Patterns, visualizes airplane traffic over North America for a 24-hour period and highlights the diversity of aircraft in the skies above. He also shows a project that visualizes international communications and SMS messages being sent in the city of Amsterdam, providing insights into the daily ebb and flow of people. Finally, he talks about the web service Mechanical Turk and how it taps into the minds of thousands of people to solve problems, raising questions about the future of mankind and the role of technology in our lives.

In this section, Aaron Koblin discusses his experiments with Mechanical Turk and how he divided a hundred dollar bill into ten thousand small pieces and fed them into the Mechanical Turk asking the participants to draw what they saw with no criteria. This inspired Koblin to launch a project called TenThousandsCents.com where he put those hundred dollar bills on the website, which can be browsed and viewed individual pieces or be traded for real hundred dollar bills in exchange for a donation to the Hundred Dollar Laptop Project. Finally, he mentions his collaboration with Daniel Massey called the Bicycle Built for 2000, in which all individual pieces of notes and phonemes were taken from the song "Daisy Bell," and fed into the Turk request, and users recreated them with their own voice, which was fed onto the site with no other context.

In this section, Aaron Koblin discusses various collaborative music-making projects, including BicycleBuiltforTwoThousand.com and the Radiohead music video he produced using laser scanners, which was open sourced as a Google Code project. He then shares how he and a music video director named Chris Milk collaborated to build a tribute project featuring Johnny Cash using a Flash drawing tool created by Mr. doob. Individuals contributed a single frame that was woven into the music video, creating a living memorial for Johnny Cash. The collaborative nature of the project allowed people from all over the world to contribute their personal touch to the tribute.

In this section, Aaron Koblin talks about two of his collaborative art projects. The first is the Johnny Cash Project, an ongoing project where users can submit individual frames that make up a music video for "Ain't No Grave". Users can rate and sort the video by the style of the art, artist's name, and location. The second project is The Wilderness Downtown, an online music video for the Arcade Fire. It asks users to enter the address of their childhood home, which creates a music video with Google maps and Street View images. Both projects demonstrate how interfaces can be used as powerful narrative devices and how socially relevant data can be used to tell meaningful stories.
