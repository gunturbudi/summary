# Summary of Why we need the explorers | Brian Cox

In this YouTube video, Professor Brian Cox argues that investing in scientific exploration is important, not only for our understanding of the universe but also for stimulating the economy and promoting innovation. Despite public spending on science being vulnerable to cuts during tough economic times, Cox emphasizes the value that space exploration has yielded, including valuable insights that humans can use to understand our own planet. He highlights the serendipity of scientific discoveries and shares images of Earth from space to emphasize its value and our place in the universe. Cox argues that there is always more to discover and that exploration is important for advancing scientific knowledge and building character and societal responsibility.

In this section, Brian Cox argues that during tough economic times, public spending on science, exploration, and curiosity-led science is often under scrutiny and vulnerable to cuts. Cox explains that, in the UK, public spending on science is only 0.6 percent of GDP, which also includes medical research, engineering, arts and humanities. Cox also provides examples of how space exploration has yielded valuable insights that humans can use to understand our own planet, such as the possibility of life in the oceans of Europa, a moon of Jupiter, and below the surface of Enceladus, a moon of Saturn. Cox argues that investing more money in scientific exploration is vital, not only for our understanding of the universe but also for stimulating the economy and promoting innovation.

In this section, Professor Brian Cox explains why exploration and science are important. Besides the wonder of new discoveries, exploration has a lot of other uses. For instance, the picture of Earth taken by Apollo 8's crew caused a stir in the environmental movement as it showed our planet was not indestructible. Additionally, studies about the economic effectiveness of the Apollo program have shown that for every dollar spent on it, 14 dollars came back into the US economy. Curiosity-driven understanding of the structure of atoms guided the development of quantum mechanics, which, in turn, led to the foundations of our modern economy. Finally, Cox explains that quantum mechanics predicts that there can be no stars in the universe bigger than 1.4 times the mass of the Sun.

In this section, Brian Cox discusses the incredible phenomenon of a Type Ia supernova explosion, which occurs when a carbon-oxygen dwarf star reaches the Chandrasekhar limit and explodes, releasing energy and a large amount of chemical elements into the universe. Cox highlights the serendipity of scientific discoveries, as well as the beauty and universality of the laws of physics. He then shares two remarkable images of Earth from space, including the famous "Pale Blue Dot" picture taken by the Voyager spacecraft from four billion miles away, emphasizing the profound idea of our place in the universe and the value of our planet.

In this section, Brian Cox argues against the notion that we know enough about the universe and don't need to discover anything else. He cites the examples of penicillin and the transistor, which were not known in the past and have transformed our lives, and quotes Humphrey Davy, who warned against presuming that our views of science are ultimate and that there are no new worlds to conquer. Cox emphasizes the importance of exploration, not only in advancing our scientific knowledge but also in building character and societal responsibility.
