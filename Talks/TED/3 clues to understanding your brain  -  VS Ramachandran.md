# Summary of 3 clues to understanding your brain | VS Ramachandran

In this video, Dr. Ramachandran discusses three examples of brain damage that lead to rare, but common, delusions. He explains how these examples rely on Freudian theory, which he finds unconvincing. The video then goes on to discuss how the brain can learn to associate a command to move a paralyzed arm with a painful sensation, leading to the development of a phantom limb. Finally, the video discusses how the brain is wired to each other, with each region being wired to every other region.

The speaker discusses three examples of brain damage that lead to rare, but common, delusions. The first example is Capgras syndrome, in which a person with a head injury loses recognition of people and objects, believing instead that they are impostors. The second example is the Capgras delusion, in which a person believes their mother is some other person. The third example is a blow to the head that damages the cortex, allowing sexual desires to become manifest. All three examples rely on Freudian theory, which the speaker finds unconvincing.

This video discusses the causes of a disorder called "visual dysfunctions," which is caused by a problem with the normal visual pathways in the brain. The disorder is caused by a defect in the wiring between the visual areas of the brain and the emotional centers of the brain, which results in a loss of emotional reactions to visual stimuli. The video explains how the disorder can be tested using a technique called galvanic skin response.

The video discusses how the brain can learn to associate a command to move a paralyzed arm with a painful sensation, leading to the development of a phantom limb. It demonstrates how mirror boxes can be used to help patients relearn this association, relieving their pain.

In this video, Dr. Ramachandran discusses how certain people have a condition called synesthesia, in which they experience a mingling of the senses. He explains that one of the two reasons why this occurs is because of a mutation in a person's genes, and that it is more common among artists, poets, and other creative people. He goes on to say that the cause of synesthesia has yet to be fully understood, but that it is an important clue to understanding creativity.

The video discusses how the brain is wired to each other, with each region being wired to every other region. It goes on to say that synesthesia (a phenomenon where the senses are combined, such as seeing numbers as colors or hearing tones as colors) is eight times more common in artists, poets and novelists than in the general population. Finally, the video demonstrates that synesthesia is a result of cross-model abstraction, where the brain is able to extract the common denominator between two stimuli that are seemingly unrelated.
