# Summary of New bionics let us run, climb and dance | Hugh Herr

This video showcases the work of Hugh Herr, a professor at the MIT Media Lab who is developing bionic limbs that are more comfortable and compliant than ever before. It also discusses the ability of bionics to communicate with the nervous system and control the movement of an artificial limb.

Hugh Herr demonstrates how his bionic limbs function, explaining that the interface between the mechanical parts of the limbs and his biological body are still not fully understood. He also discusses how the technology to attach devices to the body mechanically is inadequate, and how this is a hindrance to the development of bionics. He finishes the video by discussing the work of the MIT Media Lab's Center for Extreme Bionics, which aims to develop fundamental science and technological capability to enable the biomechatronic and regenerative repair of humans across a broad range of brain and body disabilities.

The video showcases the work of Professor Neri Oxman at the MIT Media Lab, who is developing dynamic interface technology that will allow for extraordinarily athletic feats, such as running up a rocky pathway without the assistance of legs. The work is also being used to create bionic limbs that are more comfortable and compliant than ever before.

This video introduces the concept of bionics and its potential to significantly reduce the metabolic cost of human movement. It also discusses the ability of bionics to communicate with the nervous system and control the movement of an artificial limb.

Adrianne Haslet-Davis, a dancer who was injured in the Boston terrorist attack, has regained her dance skills with the help of a research team that included MIT scientists and dancers with biological limbs. The team developed principles of dance that were embedded into her bionic limb, which allowed her to dance again.
