Riley Moynes discusses the four phases of retirement, which can be difficult for some. He explains that phase one, the ideal retirement phase, is full of freedom, sun, and relaxation, but that after a year or so, people may start to feel bored. Phase two, in which people feel loss and are lost, starts to occur when significant losses in retirement happen. Phase three, in which people try to maintain their former lifestyle, is the most difficult to deal with. Phase four is the most gratifying, satisfying phase, in which retirees can finally enjoy their retirement.

In this video, Riley Moynes talks about the phases of retirement and how it can be a difficult time. Phase one is when we lose our sense of identity and many of the relationships we had at work. Phase two is when we come face-to-face with the three Ds: divorce, depression, and decline, both physical and mental. Phase three is a time of trial and error, during which we ask ourselves what activities we can do that will make us happy and fulfilled. If we don't make it through to phase four, we may slip back into phase two, which is often a traumatic experience.
