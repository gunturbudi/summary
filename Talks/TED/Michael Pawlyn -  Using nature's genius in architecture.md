# Summary of Michael Pawlyn: Using nature's genius in architecture

Architect Michael Pawlyn explains how biomimicry, the study of nature's processes and relationships, can lead to breakthroughs in resource and energy efficiency in this TED Talk. He gives examples of successful projects utilizing biology to create efficient structures through biomimicry, such as the Eden Project, and highlights the potential of transforming waste streams into value, such as the Cardboard to Caviar project. Pawlyn also introduces the concept of symbiotic relationships in biomimicry and presents an example using concentrated solar power and the Seawater Greenhouse. He concludes that harnessing nature's genius and problem-solving methods can inspire innovative and sustainable solutions to pressing environmental problems.

In this section, the speaker discusses the concept of biomimicry and highlights how studying nature can lead to significant breakthroughs in resource and energy efficiency. He gives an example of the successful project, Eden Project, which utilized biology to create the most efficient structural solution using hexagons and pentagons. Additionally, the team utilized ETFE, a high-strength polymer, as an alternative to glass, incorporating a pressurized membrane to create a lightweight structure. He also discusses an excellent example of the closed-loop model, the Cardboard to Caviar Project, which transformed a linear process into a closed-loop model, creating more value in the process.

In this section, Michael Pawlyn discusses how waste streams can be transformed into value and how the Mobius Project integrates cycles of food, energy, water, and waste all within one building. The Sahara Forest Project is another project that reverses desertification by working with the Seawater Greenhouse that turns seawater into fresh water, and spreads the leftover fresh water around the land, increasing the humidity around the area and turning barren land back into biologically productive land to restore the environment.

In this section, Michael Pawlyn introduces the concept of symbiotic relationships in biomimicry, where different technologies can be brought together to create a sustainable system. He then presents an example using concentrated solar power (CSP) and the Seawater Greenhouse, which produces demineralized freshwater and can benefit from the waste heat produced by CSP. Pawlyn also discusses how to deal with the salts produced in the system, suggesting that they can be used to create building blocks or extract valuable elements like lithium. He concludes by emphasizing that studying nature's problem-solving methods can provide positive solutions to pressing environmental problems and inspire innovation.
