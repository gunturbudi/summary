# Summary of Neil Gershenfeld: The beckoning promise of personal fabrication

In this video, Neil Gershenfeld explores the promise of personal fabrication and the importance of integrating bits and atoms through various technologies like protein folding, laser micro-machining, and digitized fabrication. He talks about the development of Fab Labs, which have proliferated around the world, helped close the fabrication and instrumentation divide, and provided opportunities for serious problem-solving and invention. He discusses the need for a shift in aid from top-down mega-projects to grassroots, bottom-up micro-finance and introduces the micro VC fund called the Fab Foundation, which supports the scaling of "machines that make machines need businesses that make businesses." He concludes with the idea that the transition from 2D to 3D and from programming bits to programming atoms will be the ultimate feature of personal fabrication.

In this section, Neil Gershenfeld argues that the digital revolution is over and looks towards what comes after that. He presents several projects he is involved with at MIT, including Internet Zero, Fungible Computers, Integrated Chemistry in Computation, and Quantum computing as a Raw Material. All these projects are aimed at integrating bits and atoms by pushing further the integration of information and matter. Gershenfeld suggests that we haven't yet taken the same idea in communication and computation to the physical world but can achieve it through the Center for Bits and Atoms at MIT, which is a group of people that never understood the boundary between physical science and computer science.

In this section, Neil Gershenfeld explains how our current model of computation, based on 1950s technology, is not as powerful as nature's own computing abilities. He then goes on to describe various technologies that allow for digitized fabrication, such as using protein folding to specify the structure of magnetic tiles and using laser micro-machining to fabricate functional systems. Gershenfeld also discusses his class, "How To Make Almost Anything," where students without a technical background were able to integrate their skills to create unique products for the market of one person using personal fabrication. He argues that the killer app of personal fabrication is not products that you can buy, but products that make you unique.

In this section, Neil Gershenfeld talks about the creation of Fab Labs, which are equipped with low-cost but high-tech equipment for personal fabrication and instrumentation. These labs have exploded around the world, bringing empowerment to people in places lacking the resources for serious technical education. The labs have helped close the fabrication and instrumentation divide, which is larger than the digital divide, and have provided opportunities for serious problem-solving and invention. They offer a village for the outliers of society, and businesses have even begun to grow from them. However, the cost and complexity of these labs break organizational boundaries and laws, making the ultimate invention of this community social engineering.

In this section, Neil Gershenfeld discusses the shift in aid from top-down mega-projects to grassroots, bottom-up micro-finance, and the need for a similar change in developing technology. He introduces a micro VC fund called the Fab Foundation, which operates as a cross between micro-finance and VC, to support the scaling of "machines that make machines need businesses that make businesses." Gershenfeld emphasizes the power of harnessing the inventive power of the world to locally design and produce solutions to local problems through Fab Labs. He concludes with the idea that the transition from 2D to 3D and from programming bits to programming atoms will turn the end of Moore's law scaling from the ultimate bug to the ultimate feature. Together, the Fab Foundation and the class at MIT show the killer apps for personal fabrication in the developed world and the rest of the planet.
