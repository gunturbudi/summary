# Summary of Ray Kurzweil: Get ready for hybrid thinking

In this video, Ray Kurzweil discusses how the neocortex has evolved over time to allow for complex thought and sensory perception. He also explains how computers are starting to understand language using techniques similar to those used by the neocortex, eventually leading to search engines that can read and understand the content of the internet and books. Kurzweil believes that in the future, nanobots in the brain will connect to a synthetic neocortex in the cloud, leading to a qualitative leap in culture and technology.

In this section, Ray Kurzweil discusses the evolution of the neocortex, and how the growth of it has allowed mammals to think in new ways. He explains how the neocortex can learn new behavior over thousands of lifetimes and how, over time, the neocortex has become larger and more complex, and can sublimate basic drives and motivations into creating, inventing, and intellectual pursuits. Kurzweil also discusses his theory about how the brain works, utilizing modules to recognize patterns, and organizing these modules in hierarchies.

In this section, Kurzweil discusses the hierarchy of the neocortex, the part of the brain involved in high-level functions like complex thought and sensory perception. He explains how computers are starting to understand language using techniques similar to those employed by the neocortex, and predicts that in the future search engines will be able to read and understand the content of the internet and books. Furthermore, he believes that nanobots in the brain will connect to a synthetic neocortex in the cloud, exponentially expanding our thinking capacity and leading to a qualitative leap in culture and technology.
