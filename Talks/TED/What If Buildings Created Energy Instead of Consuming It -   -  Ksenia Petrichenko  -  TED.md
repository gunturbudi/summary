# Summary of What If Buildings Created Energy Instead of Consuming It? | Ksenia Petrichenko | TED

Ksenia Petrichenko discusses how buildings are responsible for one third of global energy consumption and emissions, and how improving energy efficiency can lead to significant savings, reductions in CO2 emissions, and increased comfort and productivity. She also discusses how building energy codes, standards, and labeling can help to achieve these goals.

The speaker discusses the need to shift away from electricity consumption based on fossil fuels, and towards electricity production based on renewable sources. She introduces the idea of "building prosumers," who consume and produce energy at the same time. She warns that we still have a long way to go to make this a common practice, and introduces challenges such as improving energy efficiency and installing low-carbon technologies. She also discusses the challenges posed by the current electricity grid design, and the potential for smart grids to improve reliability. Finally, she discusses the potential for electric cars to play an important role in the transition to a more sustainable energy future.

This talk discusses the potential applications of virtual power plants (VPPs), which are digital and intelligent platforms that can aggregate electricity consumption and production from many distributed resources, make use of local storage, and manage complex interactions. VPPs can facilitate peer-to-peer renewable electricity trading. This could help reduce energy bills, improve grid reliability, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, policy frameworks and electricity market design need to change in order for this to happen.
