# Summary of Tzeporah Berman: The bad math of the fossil fuel industry | TED Countdown

In her TED Countdown talk, Tzeporah Berman discusses the math behind the fossil fuel industry and the need for a global treaty to wind down production. Berman argues that the industry has deceived the public about the dangers of climate change, and that the world needs financial and technological leadership in order to reduce production. The Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, which Berman is involved with, is working to create a global registry of fossil fuel production and reserves and develop principles of equity to guide negotiations on a wind down of fossil fuels.

Tzeporah Berman, an environmental activist, discusses the math behind the fossil fuel industry, explaining that if we continue to produce oil, gas, and coal at current rates, we will exceed the amount of emissions that we are allowed to emit in order to stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Berman reaches out to climate policy experts from around the world in order to learn more about how to negotiate a fair and sustainable future for the planet, and she finds that very few governments have any sort of framework or policy in place to do so. The CEO of a major oil company told Berman that they know we have to wind down fossil fuel production, but they hope that unproven technologies will allow them to continue producing oil and gas.
