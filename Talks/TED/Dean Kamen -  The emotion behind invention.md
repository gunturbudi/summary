# Summary of Dean Kamen: The emotion behind invention

Inventor and entrepreneur Dean Kamen discusses his work in developing prosthetic arms for amputees, including veterans who have lost limbs in combat. Kamen was inspired by DARPA's request to develop a new arm for wounded soldiers, which led to the creation of the DEKA arm. Visiting Walter Reed and meeting with wounded veterans, Kamen found inspiration and support from those he sought to help. He believes that soldiers put their lives on the line for the country and deserve the best possible care and support, rather than just financial compensation.

In this section, inventor Dean Kamen shares stories about how technology can impact people's lives in remarkable ways. One story involves a veteran who, after adamantly opposing new prosthetic technology, tried it out and felt as though he had an arm again for the first time in nearly 40 years. Kamen goes on to talk about how DARPA enlisted his help to create a new arm for soldiers who had lost limbs in combat. Despite some initial doubts, Kamen was inspired by the challenge and the opportunity to help people who had sacrificed so much for their country.

In this section, inventor and entrepreneur Dean Kamen describes how he was inspired to create prosthetic limbs that offer amputees greater mobility and independence by DARPA's request to develop a prosthetic arm. Kamen promised to develop an arm in one year that slowly began to define what has now become the DEKA arm. He quickly assembled a team, and early in the project, found that patients with a strong desire to do something can encourage remarkable results. Although Kamen was looking to develop the technology behind the prosthetic arm, he found that the device had a much larger societal impact by allowing patients to perform ordinary tasks that the rest of us take for granted.

In this section, inventor Dean Kamen shares the touching story of how he and his team visited Walter Reed to get feedback from wounded veterans about a prosthetic arm they were developing. To his surprise, the veterans were enthusiastic, positive and supportive. They even went as far as making suggestions for improvements to the design. Kamen realized that these veterans weren't just in need of a better arm, they also needed support and encouragement, which they generously gave to him and his team. Their feedback and positive attitudes inspired Kamen and his team to work harder, and they eventually developed a successful prosthetic arm that has helped many veterans.

In this section of the video, Dean Kamen talks about his experiences speaking at a Veteran's Administration event in Texas where he met people recovering from injuries sustained while serving in the military. He discusses how people are often overly concerned with financial compensation rather than focusing on the care and support that these individuals deserve. According to Kamen, these soldiers deserve the best possible healthcare and prosthetics, and he won't stop working until they are given something so extraordinary that their fellow soldiers are envious. His message is that while there may be debates on healthcare and foreign policy, those who have risked their lives for the country deserve the best possible care and support.
