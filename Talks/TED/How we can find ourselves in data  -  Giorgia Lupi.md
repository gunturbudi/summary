Giorgia Lupi discusses the power of data, explaining that while they can be helpful, they can also be misleading if used incorrectly. She describes a personal experience of how her data limited perspective of reality led to political incorrectness in the early 1990s. She then relates this to the 2016 US Presidential election, in which data were used to predict an easy victory for one candidate, but were ultimately wrong.

In this video, Giorgia Lupi explains the concept of data-driven communication, which she defines as communication in which data is used as a lens or a filter to discover and reveal, for example, nuances that computers cannot gather. Lupi and fellow designer Stefanie Posavec spent one year collecting data manually to explore their minds and the words they use. Their project, "Dear Data," involved sending postcards from London to New York and New York to London, every week, containing data drawings on the front and the back. The postcards became a way for the two to connect deeply and share personal stories.
