# Summary of Which country does the most good for the world? | Simon Anholt

In a video titled "Which country does the most good for the world?", Simon Anholt discusses the need for countries to work together to solve global issues like climate change and human rights. Anholt suggests that governments need to start thinking beyond internal affairs and focus on the greater good, which is where the Good Country Index comes in. This index measures how much each country contributes to humanity, with Ireland currently ranking first. Anholt encourages people to use the word "good" to describe countries that prioritize the collective good and hopes that assessing politicians and companies based on their commitment to the greater good will inspire pride and positive change in nations.

In this section, Simon Anholt discusses the challenges faced by globalization and the need for countries to work together to solve them. The problem with the current way the world is organized is that nation-states still operate as they did 200-300 years ago, when each country was viewed as a separate entity. Politicians continue to focus on their internal affairs rather than global issues like climate change, human rights, and pandemics. Anholt suggests that citizens need to ask their governments to think outside the box, and that countries need to start working together if solutions are to be found.

In this section, Simon Anholt points out three reasons why governments tend not to change in terms of their behavior towards the world. Firstly, governments tend to look inward, rather than outward with a microscope mindset instead of a telescope one. Secondly, governments, like many of us, can have a tendency towards cultural psychopathy, whereby they struggle to empathize with people outside of their group. Finally, governments often consider the domestic and international agendas as incompatible, which is nonsense as the two can be brought together to resolve more issues effectively when looking at the international context. Although humans are an inherently conservative species who do not like change, Anholt believes it would be possible to change the behavior of politicians and the population by showing how there could be self-interest in change.

In this section, Simon Anholt explains that people admire countries that contribute something positive to the rest of the world. He introduces the Good Country Index, which measures how much each country contributes to humanity, and Ireland comes out on top. Anholt emphasizes that being a good country is not necessarily related to wealth, but rather an attitude of caring for the world and thinking beyond one's own interests. He hopes that his index will encourage countries to become more outward-looking, especially those that have focused on building their own economies in the past.
