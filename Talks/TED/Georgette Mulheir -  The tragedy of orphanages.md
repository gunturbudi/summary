In this section, Georgette Mulheir emphasizes the harm caused to children's development when separated from their families and placed in large residential institutions, particularly for young babies. She explains how the brain grows in response to experience and stimulation, building new synaptic connections, and forming powerful attachments with parents. Mulheir witnessed the impact on children in a large institution in Romania and saw that the newly admitted babies learned not to bother and became listless, lethargic, and stared into space due to a lack of stimulation and daily human contact. She has seen similar institutions across 18 different countries with depressingly similar experiences for children.
