In this section, the speaker shares her personal experience of boredom during her maternity leave after the birth of her child. She talks about how the constant notifications from her baby reminded her of the buzz generated by smartphones, which later helped her create her dream job hosting a public radio show. However, she later realized that being constantly connected made her hit a wall when she was trying to brainstorm ideas because she was never bored. She then talks about how boredom ignites a network in our brain called the "default mode," which allows us to solve problems, create personal narratives and set goals. Studies show that constantly shifting our attention from one thing to another depletes the neural resources in our brain, making us unable to multitask effectively.

In this section, Manoush Zomorodi discusses the effects of technology on our attention and creativity, citing a study by Dr. Gloria Mark that found people who are stressed tend to shift their attention more rapidly. Zomorodi launched a project called "Bored and Brilliant" to help people break their addiction to their phones and reclaim cracks in their day. The project involved participants downloading apps that measured the amount of time spent on their phone before and during challenge week, where they were given daily tasks to limit phone usage. Tristan Harris, former Google designer, highlighted the war going on to get people's attention, with companies like Facebook, Netflix, and Snapchat using engineers to get users hooked.
