# Summary of The Brain Science (and Benefits) of ASMR | Craig Richard | TED

ASMR is a relaxing sensation that is triggered by certain types of videos. The health benefits of ASMR are still unknown, but they could be similar to those of yoga, meditation, and medication for treating anxiety and insomnia. Some people may not experience ASMR, but this might be due to the videos they watch or their genes.

Craig Richard discusses how ASMR is a pleasurable response to certain scenarios, such as hair-washing and eye exams. He also mentions that ASMR is often triggered by watching TV shows, like "Bob Ross' Joy of Painting." Richard is a researcher and physiologist, and he was excited to read about the science of ASMR. In 2013, there wasn't a single peer-reviewed research study documenting ASMR, and Richard found evidence of the phenomenon across forums and comments. Every scenario cited as stimulating ASMR had a simple theme: receiving positive attention from a kind and caring individual. Richard believes that ASMR videos created by individuals who seek to cause ASMR are not beneficial, and may even be harmful.
