# Summary of How we can improve maternal healthcare -- before, during and after pregnancy | Elizabeth Howell

Maternal mortality rates in the United States are higher than in any other high-income country, but many deaths and complications can be prevented. The Alliance for Innovation in Maternal Health has developed safety bundles to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity, but these are not being used consistently. Disparities in maternal health care persist between black women and white women, and between urban and rural areas. Quality of maternal healthcare across the care continuum is an underlying cause of these disparities.

Maternal mortality rates in the United States are higher than in any other high-income country, and many deaths and serious complications can be prevented with simple, standard procedures. Obstacles to maternal health care, such as a lack of awareness and discrimination against low-income women, need to be addressed to improve maternal health.

The Alliance for Innovation in Maternal Health has developed safety bundles aimed at reducing maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity rates. However, the use of these bundles is spotty or missing across the country. Disparities in maternal health care persist between black women and white women, and between urban and rural areas.

Quality of maternal healthcare across the care continuum is an underlying cause of racial and ethnic disparities in maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity in the United States. Black women in the U.S. are more likely to deliver in hospitals with worse outcomes, and this disparity can be explained by differences in delivery hospital. High-quality maternal healthcare across the care continuum means providing access to safe and reliable contraception, providing preconception care, providing high-quality prenatal and delivery care, and providing postpartum and inter-pregnancy care. This type of care can literally spell the difference between life and death for mothers and their babies.
