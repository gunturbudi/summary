# Summary of What makes us feel good about our work? | Dan Ariely

Dan Ariely discusses how different things can make people feel good about their work, such as creating their own meaning in the job, pride in their work, and motivation. He believes that if employers took these factors into account, employees would be both more productive and happier.

In this video, Dan Ariely discusses what motivates people to work and how our expectations about work can be misleading. He then presents two experiments in which people were given Legos and were asked to build something with them. The first experiment used Legos that were given away for free, while the second experiment used Legos that were given for a price. In the Sisyphic condition, people were given Legos for a price but were told that they would have to build another one for each price decrease. In the meaningful condition, people were given Legos for a price and were told that their Bionicle would be used for the next participant. The results of the experiments showed that people were more motivated to build when they knew the Bionicles would be used by someone else.

In the second condition of this experiment, people were given instructions on how to build a Lego piece for three dollars, but were then given instructions on how to build the same piece for two seventy nine cents. The results showed that people were more likely to build the piece for two seventy nine cents.

In the video, Dan Ariely discusses how the three conditions people worked in - with or without their name on the sheet, and with or without the experimenter scanning it - affected their motivation and how positive or negative motivation can be used to improve or decrease an individual's enjoyment of a task. The next part of the video focuses on how positive motivation can be increased by adding effort and difficulty to a task, similar to how IKEA increases the enjoyment of their furniture by adding eggs and milk to the powder.

In a study, people who built origami thought it was more beautiful than those who just looked at it, and were willing to pay five times more for it. In a harder version, the effect was even larger. By making the origami harder, the builders loved it more and the evaluators hated it less. This tells us that we tend to evaluate things based on how we feel about them, and that this can change depending on the situation.
