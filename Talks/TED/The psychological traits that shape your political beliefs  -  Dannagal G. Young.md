# Summary of The psychological traits that shape your political beliefs | Dannagal G. Young

The psychological traits that shape your political beliefs are those that either make you more prone to monitoring for threats or make you more inclined to cope with uncertainty. These inclinations help to explain why people tend to gravitate towards either conservative or liberal political beliefs.

Political and social psychologists study how psychological traits shape political beliefs. Some people see the world as safe and good, which allows them to be OK with uncertainty and to take time to explore and play. Others are acutely aware of threats in their environment, so they prioritize order and predictability over openness and experimentation. In my academic research, I study how these two approaches shape how we think and feel about everything from art to politics. I also explore how political elites and partisan media use these very differences to engender hatred and fear, and how the economics of our media system exploits these same divides.

However, after studying this, I have come away not with a sense that we are doomed to be divided but that it's up to us to see both sets of traits as necessary and even valuable. Take for example two men who have been so influential in my own life. First, my late husband, Mike. He was an artist who saw the world as safe and good. He welcomed ambiguity and play in his life. In fact, we met through improv comedy where he taught improvisers to listen and be open and to be comfortable not knowing what was going to happen next. After we got married and had our baby boy, Mike was diagnosed with a brain tumor.

The psychological traits that shape your political beliefs can be summarized as those who are monitoring for threats, who prefer certainty and closure, and who make quick and efficient decisions guided by intuition and emotion. These traits help to explain why conservatives enjoy political opinion talk programming that identifies threats and enemies. However, these propensities are not absolute and can be changed depending on the context. Liberals also have psychological traits that lead them to cope with uncertainty and openness. These inclinations help to explain why scientific discovery and creativity are possible in a context where the other side is viewed as the enemy.
