# Summary of How video games turn players into storytellers | David Cage

David Cage, a video game designer, explains in his TED talk that video games are a unique form of storytelling as they allow players to become co-writers, co-actors and co-directors of their own stories. He compares traditional forms of storytelling to linear scripts while interactive scripts require managing massive tree structures with thousands of variables, conditions, and possibilities. He invites the audience to play a scene from his game "Detroit: Become Human," where we control an android named Connor in order to save a little girl held hostage. Cage suggests that interactive storytelling has the potential to revolutionize entertainment and art, similarly to how cinema changed the world in the 20th century.

In this section, David Cage talks about how traditional forms of storytelling cannot replicate the notion of choices that are so important in our own lives. Cage explains that his fascination for creating this notion of choices in fiction allowed him to develop an interactive way of storytelling and invites the TED audience to play along with an interactive scene taken from his upcoming game, "Detroit: Become Human." In the scene, we are in control of an android called Connor, trying to save a little girl taken hostage by another android. The audience makes choices for Connor, such as whether or not to save a fish and what questions to ask to Captain Allen to help solve the situation.

In this section, David Cage, a video game designer, discusses how video games are a unique and revolutionary form of storytelling that allows players to become co-writers, co-actors, and co-directors of their own stories. Compared to linear scripts, interactive scripts require dealing with time, space, and possibilities in a way that involves managing massive tree structures with thousands of variables, conditions, and possibilities. Interactive storytelling has the potential to become a new form of entertainment and art and can deeply change its time, much like cinema did in the 20th century.
