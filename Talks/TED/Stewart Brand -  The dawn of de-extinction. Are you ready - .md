# Summary of Stewart Brand: The dawn of de-extinction. Are you ready?

Stewart Brand discusses the possibility of using synthetic biology to bring back extinct species like the passenger pigeon by replacing a particular gene with another variation of that gene. He explains how scientists like Bob Lanza have already successfully brought back endangered animals such as the Javan banteng by putting its tissue in a cow, which gave birth to a healthy baby. While conservationists are excited about the revival of extinct species, they are also concerned it may overshadow efforts to protect endangered species that still need attention. Brand argues that humans have caused many species to go extinct, therefore, with new technology, they may have a moral obligation to repair the damage by bringing back keystone species and restoring the ecosystems that have been altered because of their loss.

In this section, Stewart Brand discusses the disastrous consequences of commercial hunting and the extinction of species. He talks about how the extinction of animals like the passenger pigeon and Carolina parakeet caused a sense of deep tragedy and how there is still an ongoing extinction of species. Brand wonders what people would do if they could use DNA found in fossils and museum specimens to bring back extinct species. He describes a meeting he helped organize at Harvard that brought together specialists on passenger pigeons, conservation ornithologists, bioethicists, and genetic engineers who believe that it may be possible to use ancient DNA to recreate extinct species like the passenger pigeon. Brand tells the audience about the machine used to reassemble the genomes of extinct animals and the possibilities that arise from it.

In this section, Stewart Brand discusses the process of de-extinction and how synthetic biology plays a major role in it. The technology of synthetic biology is currently advancing at four times the rate of Moore's Law, and this could lead to possibilities of replacing a particular gene with another variation of that gene. Brand discusses the possibility of bringing back the passenger pigeon, and how replacing the band-tailed pigeon's genes with those of the passenger pigeon could successfully bring it back to life. Brand also talks about Ryan Phelan and his non-profit organization Revive and Restore, which aims to create de-extinction experiments in a responsible way. The meeting in Boston also led to the realization that there are scientists all over the world working on various forms of de-extinction, and the National Geographic got interested in this topic, leading to the funding and hosting of a meeting with 35 scientists.

In this section, Stewart Brand discusses how scientists are using cutting-edge technology to revive extinct species. Cryopreservation pioneer, Oliver Ryder, has collected tissues of over 1,000 species at the San Diego zoo, which are viable cells as they're frozen minus 196 degrees Celsius. Scientists like Bob Lanza have already taken tissue from an endangered animal called the Javan banteng and put it in a cow, which went to term and gave birth to a live and healthy baby Javan banteng. Each technique used by scientists is building towards the goal of bringing back the passenger pigeon, which has already successfully been done with birds through homologous recombination. While conservationists are excited about the revival of extinct species, they are also concerned it may overshadow the efforts to protect endangered species that still need attention.

In this section, Stewart Brand discusses the potential of de-extinction and how it's time for the subject to go public. He mentions that humans have made a significant impact and caused many species to go extinct, which means they have the ability and possibly even the moral obligation to repair that damage. This would mostly involve expanding and protecting wildlands and populations of endangered species. However, with new technology, humans could also eventually bring back entirely extinct species, such as the woolly mammoth, the passenger pigeon, and the great auk. While some people may worry about the unintended consequences of interfering in nature in this way, Brand argues that humans have already interfered by making these animals go extinct; and since they were keystone species, we need to bring them back to restore the ecosystems that have been altered because of their loss.
