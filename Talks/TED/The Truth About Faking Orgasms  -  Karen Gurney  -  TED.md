# Summary of The Truth About Faking Orgasms | Karen Gurney | TED

The author discusses the gender orgasm gap, or the difference in the rates of orgasm between men and women. She discusses how the "tricky orgasm" myth has been challenged by various pieces of sex research, and that despite this, many women still feel like they need to fake their orgasms in order to please their partners. This leads to them feeling disempowered and silenced, and eventually forces them to fake it. This in turn leads to men overestimating how often women orgasm, and underestimating how often women are faking it.
