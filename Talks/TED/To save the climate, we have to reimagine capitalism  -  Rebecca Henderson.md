# Summary of To save the climate, we have to reimagine capitalism | Rebecca Henderson

Rebecca Henderson argues that capitalism has become monstrous due to companies selling fossil fuels and emitting greenhouse gases causing enormous damage without consequence. Business should take action to fix capitalism as it is in their interest to do so. Henderson shares the story of Erik Osmundsen, who became CEO of a garbage company and reduced emissions, ran the business cleanly, raised prices to cover costs, persuaded employees to cut costs legally, convinced investors the high road pays off, and persuaded regulators to enforce rules. Henderson highlights this example as businesses taking a stand for fair, free markets and laws that prevent individuals from dumping garbage without consequences.

In this section, Rebecca Henderson argues that the main cause of climate change is that capitalism has turned into something monstrous because we let companies that sell fossil fuels, and anyone that emits greenhouse gases, cause enormous damage for which they do not have to pay. She believes that business should step up to fix capitalism since it is squarely in the private sector's interest to do so. The truth is business is screwed if we don't fix climate change because it will be hard to make money when the great coastal cities are under water, and millions of people migrate north as the harvests fail.

In this section, Rebecca Henderson tells the story of Erik Osmundsen, who left his private equity job to become the CEO of a garbage company and change the way waste was handled to reduce emissions. Despite running into corruption and resistance from employees and customers, he ran his business clean and raised prices to cover the costs, persuading employees to find ways to cut costs legally and convincing investors that the high road could pay off. He also persuaded competitors to refuse illegal waste disposal and pushed regulators to enforce rules. Henderson highlights this example as one of the many businesses taking a stand and pushing for fair, free markets and laws that make it impossible for individuals to dump garbage without consequences.
