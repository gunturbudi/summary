# Summary of Andreas Raptopoulos: No roads? There's a drone for that

Andreas Raptopoulos, the CEO of Matternet, believes that drones could revolutionize transportation in areas without access to all-season roads. Matternet has created an automated logistics network that uses small, electric, autonomous flying vehicles to transport goods like medicine quickly and inexpensively. The system includes UAVs that fly autonomously and dock in automated ground stations to swap batteries and payloads, automated ground stations that monitor weather data and secure the landing, and an operating system that optimizes the network's resources. Raptopoulos highlights that the cost of transportation with the drones is just 24 cents for two kilograms over 10 kilometers, with only two cents spent on energy, making it a low infrastructure investment with a small ecological footprint. He believes that this new mode of transportation could solve the inefficiency of congested cities, creating a new platform for economic transactions that could help lift millions of people out of poverty.

In this section, Andreas Raptopoulos discusses the many people in the world who don't have access to all-season roads and the potential for drones to revolutionize transportation in these areas. His company, Matternet, has created an automated logistics network that could transport goods like medicine quickly and inexpensively using small, electric, autonomous flying vehicles. Three key technologies make up the system: UAVs that fly autonomously and dock in automated ground stations to swap batteries and payloads; automated ground stations that secure the most vulnerable part of the mission - the landing - and monitor weather data; and an operating system that optimizes the entire network's resources. Raptopoulos believes the system could help people who depend on medicine and other critical supplies to get them in a timeframe that could make a real difference.

In this section, Andreas Raptopoulos explains that the cost of transportation with the drones is just 24 cents for two kilograms over 10 kilometers, and only two cents of which is for the energy expended for the flight. He emphasizes that the drone transportation can have significant impact in the world as it requires very low infrastructure investment with a small ecological footprint. He highlights the other end of the spectrum where setting up a network of transportation that sits between the road and the Internet can solve the issue of inefficiency of congested cities with a new mode of transportation operating 24/7 in the background. Raptopoulos believes that the transportation of matter can reach millions of people with better vaccines and medication and lift them out of poverty, making it a new platform for economic transactions.
