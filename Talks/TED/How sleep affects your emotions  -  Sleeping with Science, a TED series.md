# Summary of How sleep affects your emotions | Sleeping with Science, a TED series

In "How sleep affects your emotions," a TED talk by TED and Sleep Number, the speaker explains how lack of sleep can impact the emotional brain. A study conducted on healthy adults found that a lack of sleep made the amygdala, a deep emotional brain center, almost 60% more responsive. The prefrontal cortex, responsible for regulating the amygdala, had no connection with the amygdala in people who were sleep-deprived, leading to unregulated emotional responses. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was found to act as a soothing balm that provides emotional convalescence.

In this section, the speaker discusses how a lack of sleep impacts the emotional brain by focusing on a brain imaging study conducted on a group of healthy adults who were either given a night of sleep or sleep-deprived. The study found that the amygdala, a deep emotional brain center, was almost 60% more responsive under conditions of a lack of sleep. The prefrontal cortex was identified as the brain region responsible for regulating the amygdala, and in people who were sleep-deprived, the connection between the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala was severed, leading to an unregulated emotional response. On the other hand, rapid eye movement sleep acts like a soothing balm that takes the sharp edges off difficult experiences, providing emotional convalescence.
