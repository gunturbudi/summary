# Summary of Are indoor vertical farms the future of agriculture? | Stuart Oda

This YouTube video discusses indoor vertical farming, which is a type of agriculture that is more efficient and cost-effective than conventional farming methods. Vertical farms can be located in urban areas and can produce a variety of nutritious vegetables. Some drawbacks of vertical farming include the high energy usage and the high cost of production. However, investments are being made in energy efficiency and robotics in order to reduce labor costs and to address the small variety of vegetables that can be commercially produced.

This YouTube video introduces indoor vertical farming, which is a technology that allows for year-round vegetable production using less water and fertilizer. Vertical farms can be located in urban areas and can produce a variety of vegetables that are high in nutrition and low in calories. Some drawbacks of vertical farming include the high energy usage and the high cost of production. Investments are being made in energy efficiency and robotics in order to reduce labor costs and to address the small variety of vegetables that can be commercially produced. Integration of vertical farming into cityscapes is being explored as a way to repurpose underutilized urban infrastructure and to provide access to nutritious vegetables to food deserts.
