# Summary of The brain in love | Helen Fisher

The video discusses the research of a team of scientists who have used functional MRI to study the brains of people in love. They found that the brains of people in love are active in a specific area of the brain called the ventral tegmental area. This part of the brain is associated with reward and motivation. The video suggests that romantic love is a basic mating drive, an obsession, and an addiction.

The video discusses the findings of a study in which participants who had just been rejected were observed to have increased activity in three brain regions associated with love: the brain region associated with intense romantic love, the brain region associated with calculating gains and losses, and the brain region associated with deep attachment to another individual. The author suggests that romantic love is a basic mating drive, an obsession, and an addiction.

This video is a talk by Helen Fisher about the brain in love. Fisher explains that animals have a preference for certain individuals and that this preference is based in the brain's reward system. She also discusses a recent study that has looked at long-term relationships and found that the same brain regions that are associated with intense romantic love still become active. Finally, she discusses her upcoming project of understanding why people fall in love.

The brain in love is described as intimacy for women. Men tend to get this from side-by-side doing, whereas as soon as one guy looks up, the other guy will look away. For millions of years, men faced their enemies and sat side-by-side with friends, thus contributing to the brain's propensity for love. The challenge for men is to understand each other better.
