# Summary of Great Leadership Is a Network, Not a Hierarchy | Gitte Frederiksen | TED

Physicist turned management consultant Gitte Frederiksen argues in a TED talk that great leadership is not hierarchy but a network of collaboration. Distributed leadership promotes dynamic, resilient, and sustainable progress by removing labels, sharing information, and revealing hidden potential within teams. Embracing kindness and creating leaders are also essential for fostering a strong team culture of growth, trust, and safety. Frederiksen's company experimented with distributed leadership, resulting in better outcomes, improved work-life balance, and more ownership. In today's fast-paced and complex world, traditional leaders who maintain hierarchies and withhold knowledge impede progress, so everyone should see themselves as leaders to embrace the benefits that come with distributed leadership.

To make this a reality, we need to remove labels that box people in and share everything - information, resources, and ideas - to enable growth outside of our boxes and reveal hidden potential within teams.
