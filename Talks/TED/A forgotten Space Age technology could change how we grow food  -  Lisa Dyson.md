# Summary of A forgotten Space Age technology could change how we grow food | Lisa Dyson

Lisa Dyson discusses the potential for sustainable agriculture using NASA-developed closed-loop carbon cycle technology involving supercharged carbon recyclers, allowing for vertical agriculture that can grow in any season and location using minimal space. This technology makes it possible to produce 10,000 times more output per land area than planting soybeans, without the need for removing rainforests to make the food and goods consumed. Dyson believes this technology can help recycle carbon dioxide into valuable products profitably and benefit the planet and business by producing protein meals, oils, and nutrients that could produce items such as pasta, bread, cakes, detergents, soaps, lotions, and other consumer products.

In this section, the speaker describes how NASA scientists developed a closed-loop carbon cycle involving microorganisms that could sustain life aboard spacecraft. They used hydrogenotrophs to create a virtuous carbon cycle where astronauts would breathe out carbon dioxide which would then be captured by the microbes and converted into a carbon-rich crop for them to eat. The technology was not used in space, but the speaker and her colleague started a company to cultivate these NASA-type microbes to make valuable products on Earth such as essential amino acids, protein-rich meals, and oils that can be used as biodegradable cleaners or even jet fuel. They want to bring these products to market and believe this technology can help recycle carbon dioxide into valuable products profitably and benefit the planet and business.

In this section, the speaker discusses the need for sustainable agriculture in order to meet the demands of the growing population and consumer goods industry, projected to increase by 70 percent by 2050. However, modern agriculture, being one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases and taking up a great amount of land, cannot sustainably scale to meet this demand. The speaker proposes the use of supercharged carbon recyclers, microbes that serve as natural recyclers in their ecosystems, to create a type of vertical agriculture that can grow in any season and location using minimal space. This approach would allow for the production of 10,000 times more output per land area than planting soybeans, without the need for removing rainforests to make the food and goods consumed.

In this section, Dyson explains the potential products of this new type of agriculture, including protein meal, oils, and nutrients that could produce items such as pasta, bread, cakes and even consumer products like detergents, soaps, lotions. She highlights that as we run the risk of damaging the planet and robbing future generations under the status quo of modern agriculture, creating systems for sustainable food production on Earth will require us to imagine a future of abundance, and offer ways of living that benefit ten billion people by 2050.
