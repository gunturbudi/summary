In 2006, Dutch architects Jeroen Koolhaas and Dre Urhahn traveled to Rio de Janeiro to film a documentary about the city's favelas. They were struck by the community's DIY spirit and envisioned painting all of the favela's houses the same blue color as the police station. While the idea was initially met with hostility, the project eventually succeeded and inspired others to create art in their communities. In 2011, during a time of war between the police and drug gangs, the project was put on hold but was ultimately completed a year later.

The Haas and Hahn team painted a street in Rio de Janeiro, and then took their approach to painting a large hill in Philadelphia. The team was able to use community involvement and local talent to create a project that was both beautiful and practical.
