# Summary of A kinder, gentler philosophy of success | Alain de Botton

Alain de Botton, a philosopher, explores the causes of career anxiety and states the dominance of snobbery and materialism, increased societal expectations, and the association of envy with equality, make it challenging to achieve professional goals without anxiety. He also mentions that meritocracy, i.e., believing that people who deserve success will be successful and those who fail deserve to be at the bottom, leads to personalization of success/failure, resulting in low self-esteem and rise in suicide rates. De Botton proposes abandoning the pursuit of a perfectly meritocratic society and instead turning to sympathy through Western tradition, which acknowledges individual ownership and the importance of tragedy in achieving a nuanced understanding of success that recognizes the element of loss, and a balance between human and non-human elements.

In this section, philosopher Alain de Botton discusses career anxiety and why it has become so prevalent in modern society. He suggests that one reason for this anxiety is the dominance of snobbery, particularly surrounding job titles. Another cause is that modern society has pegged emotional rewards to material goods, making them more desirable even though it is not the goods we want but the rewards. Furthermore, societal expectations have never been higher, and we are told anyone can achieve anything. While this may seem like a good thing, the spirit of equality is also linked to envy, which can make for a stressful situation. Ultimately, modern society has turned the entire world into a school, where everyone is equal yet different, making it challenging to achieve one's desired career goals without experiencing anxiety.

In this section of the video, Alain de Botton explains how the idea of meritocracy can lead to increased feelings of anxiety and low self-esteem. Believing that people who deserve success will be successful also means that those who fail deserve to be at the bottom. This personalization of success and failure has led to an increase in suicide rates in individualistic countries. De Botton suggests that we abandon the pursuit of a perfectly meritocratic society as it is impossible to achieve and instead turn to the Western tradition of tragic art which offers sympathy to those who fail, unlike the current culture which ridicules them.

In this section, Alain de Botton shares his thoughts on success and failure, and how society's definition of success is often influenced by external factors such as family, media, and marketing. He argues that it's important for individuals to examine their own ideas of success and ensure that they are truly their own, as opposed to being influenced by outside forces. De Botton also highlights the importance of tragedy and non-human elements, such as nature, in providing a balance to our human-centered lives. Overall, de Botton encourages a nuanced understanding of success that acknowledges the element of loss and prioritizes individual ownership over external influences.

In this section, philosopher Alain De Botton explains that while he considers justice to be unattainable, it is still worth the effort to pursue it. However, he emphasizes that there is a strong element of randomness in the winning and losing process, and societies should make room for that. He also discusses the idea of combining a gentler philosophy of work with a successful economy and the importance of having a "tough but gentle" leadership style in society's exemplary father figures.
