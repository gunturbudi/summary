# Summary of Is there a role for carbon credits in a just transition to net zero? | TED Countdown Dilemma Series

The video discusses the idea of net zero and the role of carbon credits in achieving it. It argues that while carbon credits can be useful, they are often not effective enough and can be expensive. It suggests that companies focus less on achieving net zero and more on working towards a global net zero outcome.

In this TED talk, Lindsay Levin discusses the challenges in transitioning to a net-zero world, specifically discussing the role of carbon credits. While carbon credits can be useful in incentivizing emission reductions, there are concerns about the quality of the credits and the way they are being used. Ultimately, the talk discusses the need for collaboration and deep listening in order to find solutions to the climate crisis.

The video discusses the idea of net zero, which has become central to global plans to avoid disaster due to climate change. The concept is flawed, as it gives the impression that we can continue to burn fossil fuels while still having a net impact on climate. Prof. James Dyke of the University of Exeter provide a criticism of carbon-neutral fossil fuels, arguing that it is an oxymoron and that it harms our collective willingness to adopt behavioral changes and costly investments needed to transition to a safer planet.

Some studies estimate that trillions of dollars would be needed to make large-scale carbon removal technologies work, and many believe they may actually be making things worse. However, carbon markets could potentially provide investment in vital natural solutions.
One level higher, at governments, some are trying to get the market to work but it's still not equitable, safe, or the impact that we want.

Carbon markets can help reduce emissions, protect natural carbon sinks, and remove CO2 from the atmosphere. They can also help fund clean infrastructure projects in the Global South. However, they often miss the mark in terms of emissions reduction and can be expensive. Reduction credits that focus on clean infrastructure projects are the best type to use.

Derik Broekhoff, a researcher at the Stockholm Environment Institute, argues that companies should focus less on achieving net zero and more on working towards a global net zero outcome. He suggests that companies focus on the big picture, putting equity first, and making sure their emissions reductions are beneficial to the global community.

The presenter discusses the need for carbon credits to be rooted in high integrity in order to be an effective tool in the fight against climate change, and introduces the concept of core carbon principles. These principles include additionality, permanence, robust quantification, validation and verification, no double-counting, and sustainable development impacts and safeguards.

The Dilemma Series was born out of a conviction that when reasonable people disagree, the way out is not to dismiss one side over another, but to hold and value different points of view and see what we can generate together. In dilemma thinking, this is called the resolution zone, and reaching it is vital if we are going to make real progress on climate.

We heard from leading voices who we invited to share ideas, ask questions and engage in productive debate about the role carbon credits might play in a just transition to net zero. Some voices argued that carbon credits are necessary to create a market that is valuable to people on the ground who didn't contribute to climate change, while others argued that carbon credits are a waste of money and will not create a market that is valuable to those on the ground.

The debates are important because this is the hardest problem that we've ever faced, and we need to be open to our critics in order to figure out how to get to solutions. The heterodoxy of perspective and opinion stimulates new ideas, and if we start the conversations with respect and with open minds, we get to new places. We need a kind of grounded sense of hope and optimism, which has got kind of rough edges and realism.

The video discusses how the different perspectives of different people can help improve a group's intelligence.
