# Summary of John Wilbanks: Let's pool our medical data

The study discussed in this video is designed to allow participants to share their medical data in a computable form. The goal is to learn more about how many people are unwilling to be reasonable when it comes to their health. The study is set to begin in the next few months and will include 150,000 women in California.

This video discusses the history and methodology of clinical studies, which have not changed much over the last several centuries despite technological advances. However, new technologies like genome sequencing are changing the way we can study disease. The video also features a brief interview with a grandson and son of two people who were interviewed for a clinical study, illustrating how the data collected from these studies can be used to predict the health of descendants.

John Wilbanks discusses the problems with current medical data sharing systems, which are designed to protect people's privacy but instead prevent innovation and prevent people from getting the treatments they need. He proposes the creation of a commons of medical data, which would allow for innovation and the sharing of data among researchers who are not credentialed.

John Wilbanks discusses the importance of digital commonses, which can be used to share data to create correlations between subtle variations and health outcomes. He urges people to try to get their data, as it is surprisingly difficult to do so. The clinical study that he has started is fully digital, self-contributed, global in participation, ethically approved, and simple to use.
