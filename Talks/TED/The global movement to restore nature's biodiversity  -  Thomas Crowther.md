# Summary of The global movement to restore nature's biodiversity | Thomas Crowther

The video discusses the global movement to restore nature's biodiversity, focusing on the potential of restoring forests to combat climate change. The speaker emphasizes the importance of proper ecosystem restoration, highlighting the need for accurate ecological information and the dangers of monocultures. The speaker introduces Restor, an open data platform developed with Google, designed for the protection and amendment of land. The movement needs collective action from all sectors of society, including farmers, project leaders, scientists, governments, NGOs, and businesses, to restore biodiversity and counteract the negative effects of climate change.

In this section, the speaker discusses the potential of forests to combat climate change and the global movement to restore them. Through their research, they discovered that there are 0.9 billion hectares where trees could naturally exist outside of urban and agricultural areas, which could be room for just over one trillion new trees. Protecting these areas in the long term might capture up to 30% of the excess carbon in the atmosphere, capturing decades of human emissions. The speaker highlights the importance of nuance in communication to avoid the perception that restoration is the single solution to climate change and emphasizes that restoration alone is not a silver bullet.

In this section, the speaker emphasizes the importance of restoring natural ecosystems properly, rather than simply planting trees as a quick solution. The creation of monocultures, such as rapid timber plantations, can result in a loss of biodiversity and damage to ecosystems, highlighting the need for accurate ecological information to identify the best areas and species for restoration. The speaker then introduces Restor, an open data platform developed with Google, that provides free ecological insights and enables restoration organizations and funders to share information and learn from one another. Restor is designed for the protection and amendment of land, vegetation, and soil, and can be used to promote the health of all types of ecosystems, with the aim of restoring biodiversity and counteracting the negative effects of climate change.

In this section, the speaker emphasizes the importance of restoring nature's biodiversity for local communities and the benefits that could go beyond addressing climate change. While tech solutions and tools can inform us, the global restoration movement requires collective action from humans. The movement needs everyone, including farmers, project leaders, scientists, governments, NGOs, and businesses, to keep it going. Just like the interdependent species in ecosystems, humans are deeply dependent on one another, and the whole ecology of humanity is needed to address the challenge of global restoration.
