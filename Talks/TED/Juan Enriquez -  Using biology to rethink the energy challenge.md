# Summary of Juan Enriquez: Using biology to rethink the energy challenge

Juan Enriquez discusses the potential for biology to transform the energy industry, pointing out the need to view hydrocarbons as part of solar energy and the shift towards bioenergy in agriculture. He suggests using biological processes to extract energy from coal and reducing energy content to make way for alternative sources. Enriquez also proposes stabilizing oil prices through a non-revenue tax to incentivize research and development in energy innovation without fear of market fluctuations. While this approach is currently expensive, Enriquez highlights the success of companies like Synthetic Genomics, Cambria, and Codon in applying biological principles for specific purposes.

In this section, the speaker discusses the importance of understanding and managing bioenergy, which includes oil, gas, coal, and agriculture. He highlights the evolution of agriculture over the past 11,000 years and points out the shift from brute force engineering and chemistry to biology, which led to significant productivity increases. The speaker emphasizes the role of biology in improving energy production and management and highlights the impact of Norman Borlaug, who taught countries like India and China how to grow grains more efficiently, thus launching the Green Revolution. By embracing technological advancements, countries can boost their productivity, reduce famine, and become exporters of vital resources.

In this section of the video, Juan Enriquez is discussing the link between biology and energy. He explains that oil and other hydrocarbons, if they come from organic matter, are concentrated sunlight. Bioenergy, on the other hand, takes the sun and concentrates it in plants and amoebas. Enriquez suggests that we need to start thinking of oil and other hydrocarbons as part of solar panels. Coal is probably the same as plants, and therefore bioenergy. However, we have been using a brute force approach to obtain these energy sources, which is not sustainable, and we need to start thinking of these reserves as biological energy sources. If we keep treating them as chemical or engineering energy sources, we will face significant problems.

In this section, Juan Enriquez discusses the potential for using biological processes to extract energy from coal, rather than physically extracting it through techniques like mountaintop removal or burning it. This bioenergy approach would involve using organisms to process coal in a biological way, similarly to how biological processes are used in agriculture. This could also lead to a shift in how we view and structure energy and the very nature of life itself. Enriquez cites the success of companies like Synthetic Genomics, Cambria, and Codon in applying biological principles to avoid brute force and program cells for specific purposes. However, he also cautions that this approach is currently very expensive in both economic and energy terms.

In this section, Juan Enriquez discusses the importance of reducing energy content and applying biological principles to energy in order to move towards alternative sources such as wind, solar, and nuclear power. He explains that 86% of the energy consumed currently is hydrocarbons, which limits the potential for conservation and the development of alternative sources. Enriquez also suggests stabilizing oil prices through a non-revenue tax, so entrepreneurs and companies have incentive to produce energy for a fixed price. This will allow research to progress without the fear that they will be outcompeted due to market fluctuations.
