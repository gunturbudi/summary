# Summary of Pavan Sukhdev: Put a value on nature!

Pavan Sukhdev stresses the economic invisibility of nature and calls for the need to place a higher value on natural capital. He argues that preserving natural resources is crucial, as they provide essential services to the poor who depend on them most. Sukhdev highlights the need to determine who should be paid for the benefits of nature and how to preserve these assets. He also emphasizes the importance of calculating the cost of externalities at a company level, creating green carbon markets, and implementing mechanisms like REDD Plus to reduce emissions from deforestation and agricultural activities. Finally, Sukhdev reminds us of the ethical choice to not have coral reefs and urges society to be more conscious of the impact of their choices as natural resources are limited and cannot withstand more ethical choices.

In this section, Pavan Sukhdev discusses the economic invisibility of nature and how it is being addressed through the TEEB project, which aims to put a value on the benefits that flow from nature to humans. He explains that natural capital is being lost at an extraordinary rate, with an estimated two to four trillion dollars-worth disappearing. Sukhdev emphasizes the importance of addressing this invisibility and describes how the lack of economic incentives for preserving nature has led to a gradual degradation and loss of natural assets. He uses examples such as the Amazon rainforest's ability to produce rainfall for an agricultural economy and the value of insect-based pollination. Ultimately, Sukhdev highlights the need to determine who should be paid for the benefits of nature and how to preserve these assets.

In this section, Pavan Sukhdev emphasizes the importance of preserving natural resources, as they provide essential services to the poor who depend most on them. He explains that ecosystem services are not factored into the GDP of countries like Brazil, India, and Indonesia, even though they are worth around 45 percent to 90 percent for the poor. Sukhdev shows how the destruction of the natural ecosystem can lead to a large decrease in species diversity, leading to a potential global catastrophe. Sukhdev emphasizes the need for businesses to calculate the external costs of what they do, and for society to place a higher value on natural capital.

In this section, Pavan Sukhdev discusses the importance of calculating the cost of externalities at a company level, which is crucial in understanding the social performance of companies. He gives the example of PUMA, which calculated $94 million worth of externalities as a result of its business practices. Sukhdev also emphasizes the need to create green carbon markets and implement mechanisms like REDD Plus to reduce emissions from deforestation and agricultural activities. However, he acknowledges that economics cannot solve every problem, as coral reefs and the health of oceans remain a challenge globally.

In this section, Sukhdev highlights the importance of coral reefs as sources of food and livelihood for half a billion people in developing countries. He also notes that any carbon dioxide levels above 350 parts per million are too dangerous for the survival of these reefs, and therefore, choosing a target of 450 parts per million in climate negotiations is an ethical choice to not have coral reefs. Sukhdev urges society to be more conscious of the impact of their choices as natural resources are limited and cannot withstand more ethical choices.
