Innovative organizations have three key capabilities: creative abrasion, creative agility, and creative resolution. Creative abrasion is about allowing disagreement and debate to happen, and it's important for organizations to have this capability in order to be able to test and refine their ideas. Creative agility is about being able to quickly pursue a solution to a problem, and it's important for organizations to have this capability in order to be able to constantly learn and adapt. Creative resolution is about being able to combine opposing ideas in order to create a new solution, and it's important for organizations to have this capability in order to be able to make decisions that are both effective and sustainable. Pixar is able to be so successful because it has these three capabilities in abundance. Google's infrastructure group, which is responsible for keeping the website up and running all the time, relies on these same capabilities in order to be successful.
