# Summary of Ryan Phelan: The intended consequences of helping nature thrive | TED

Ryan Phelan discusses the benefits of genetic rescue in conservation using the examples of black-footed ferrets and Przewalski's horses. She also explores the potential use of emerging genetic engineering technologies to help species adapt to climate change, such as genome editing thermal resilience in coral reefs. Phelan emphasizes the importance of public engagement and careful consideration of the intended consequences of interventions to prevent extinction and create a better future. Additionally, she highlights that de-extinction is just one aspect of genetic rescue tools, which are essential in protecting biodiversity.

In this section, we learn about the benefits of genetic rescue in conservation, using the examples of the black-footed ferret and the Przewalski's horse. Both species, which faced extinction due to habitat loss and inbreeding, were cloned using cells from animals with unique genetic variations that had been banked many years ago. Through genetic rescue, these cloned animals were able to restore the lost genetic diversity within their species and increase the populations' resilience to extinction. However, despite its success, conservationists have been slow to adopt these biotechnologies.

In this section, the speaker discusses the potential use of emerging genetic engineering technologies to help species adapt to climate change and solve issues like invasive species and wildlife diseases. He focuses on the case of coral reefs and the potential to genome edit thermal resilience to counteract the loss of coral due to climate change. The speaker acknowledges concerns about unintended consequences, but research shows that interventions in nature have a 99% success rate in achieving their intended consequences, with very little harm caused to the environment. The speaker encourages a shift in focus from the fear of the unknown consequences to a recognition of the success stories that could come from using these new technologies.

In this section, Phelan discusses the potential resurrection of the American chestnut tree through genetic modification, as well as the importance of public engagement and support for such bold initiatives. She urges people to carefully plan and consider the intended consequences of interventions to prevent extinction and create the future we want, rather than being paralyzed by fear of the unknown. Anderson raises the issue of the moral questions surrounding intentional inaction versus intentional action, and Phelan suggests that public pressure and fear of failure can play a role in scientists' reluctance to take bold action. They also briefly touch on the possibility of de-extinction through technology like synthetic biology.

In this section, Ryan Phelan emphasizes that the ultimate goal of de-extinction is just one aspect of the genetic rescue tools and technology that can be used to save endangered species. These tools are a fundamental toolkit and essential in protecting the world's biodiversity. She believes that if we can achieve de-extinction, it will be a grand accomplishment, but the main focus should be on how these tools can be applied to protect and preserve endangered species.
