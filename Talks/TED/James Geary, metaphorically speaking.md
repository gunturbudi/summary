# Summary of James Geary, metaphorically speaking

Metaphor is a powerful tool that can be used to enhance understanding or create expectations. It is important to be aware of the impact that metaphors can have on our thinking and decision-making.

Detail Summary:

Metaphor is the process of giving a word a name that belongs to something else, and it is an essential part of how we understand ourselves and others. Elvis Presley's song "All Shook Up" is an excellent example of how metaphor works, and it uses synesthesia, pattern recognition, and cognitive dissonance to create a more vivid understanding of the lyrics.

Metaphors are everywhere, and they can have a significant impact on our thinking and decisions. One example is the phrase "I think, therefore I am." This phrase is translated more accurately as "I shake things up, therefore I am."

Metaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery, and it can be used to create expectations about situations that are not actually true. Additionally, metaphor can influence decisions by activating analogies.
