# Summary of Dan Dennett: Responding to Pastor Rick Warren

Philosopher Dan Dennett suggests that educating children about world religions is crucial for an informed citizenry in democratic societies. He argues that parents have a responsibility not only to teach their children their chosen creed but also to provide factual knowledge about other religions. Dennett also discusses the cleverness of natural selection, the importance of understanding Leslie Orgel's Second Rule to realize why the idea of Intelligent Design is flawed, and the role of religion in culture. He critiques Pastor Rick Warren's book "The Purpose Driven Life," commending its accessible language and insights while highlighting problematic passages. Moreover, Dennett criticizes Warren's use of scientific facts and metaphors, his belief that accepting the theory of evolution is incompatible with morality and meaning, and his view that the Bible must be the authoritative standard for one's life.

In this section of the video, philosopher and cognitive scientist Dan Dennett talks about how religions are natural phenomena, just like cows, and how they have evolved over millennia. He suggests that religions are important social institutions that should be studied with the same intensity that we study other natural phenomena. Dennett proposes a policy of educating children about world religions in both public and private schools, so that they can learn about the facts of different religions in the same way they learn about reading, writing, and arithmetic.

In this section, philosopher Dan Dennett discusses the importance of teaching children about various religions and their practices. He argues that providing factual knowledge about different faiths is crucial for informed consent, a cornerstone of democracy. Dennett believes that while parents may teach their children their chosen creed, they also have an obligation to educate them on other religions. He challenges the notion of keeping children ignorant of other faiths to maintain purity and stresses the importance of an informed citizenry in democratic societies. He moves on to talk about the cleverness of natural selection, using the example of sheep acquiring shepherds through outsourcing of protection and food-finding.

In this section, Dan Dennett argues that the idea of Intelligent Design is a hoax. By understanding Leslie Orgel's Second Rule, which says that evolution is cleverer than humans, one can realize why this idea is flawed. Although natural selection does not have purpose or design, the designs that it produces are brilliant. Dennett also talks about how culture has allowed humans to dominate the planet, and religion is a key to culture. He shares examples of parasites that hijack the brains of other species, comparing them to how religion can cause humans to surrender self-interest to a higher power.

In this section, Dan Dennett discusses the book "The Purpose Driven Life" by Rick Warren, acknowledging that it is a brilliant book which has achieved its goal of bringing purpose to peopleâ€™s lives, as well as selling millions of copies. Dennett commends the book's accessible language, excellent insights into human psychology, and advice, whilst also highlighting the problematic parts. He notes that he doesn't agree with some of the passages, such as the suggestion that without a belief in God, life would have no purpose or meaning, and how some readers may believe they do not have to take action to preserve the environment as God designed it for humans. Ultimately, Dennett wishes Warren would do a revision of the book to address some of these issues.

In this section of the transcript, philosopher Dan Dennett criticizes Pastor Rick Warren's use of scientific facts and metaphors, claiming they discourage scientific understanding.

He also criticizes Warren's view that the Bible must be the "authoritative standard" for one's life and that reasoning against it is the voice of the Devil. Finally, Dennett questions Warren's call to engulf other religions and the popular belief that being good requires belief in God.
