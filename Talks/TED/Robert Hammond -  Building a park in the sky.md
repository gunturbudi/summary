# Summary of Robert Hammond: Building a park in the sky

Robert Hammond, Co-Founder of Friends of the High Line, shares how he and Joshua David saved the mile-and-a-half-long railway from demolition and turned it into an elevated park that runs through Manhattan. The aim was to create a park inspired by a wildscape of blooms with economic feasibility studies indicating that over 20 years, the value to the city would be $250m, but it has turned out to be half-a-billion dollars. The High Line's success was beyond their dreams with about two million people visiting last year, which was ten times what was estimated. Hammond also notes that the park has transformed New York City's culture, as people are more willing to hold hands there, demonstrating the power of public spaces to change city life.

In this section, Robert Hammond, Co-Founder of Friends of the High Line, shares the story of how he and Joshua David rallied to save the mile and a half railway from becoming demolished and turned it into an elevated park that runs through the middle of Manhattan. The High Line was originally a freight line known as "Death Avenue," and even with the hired West Side Cowboy, about one person a month was killed and run over. The goal was to create a park inspired by a wildscape with blooms of wildflowers. The economic feasibility study showed that over a 20-year period, the value to the city would be $250m, which has turned out to be half-a-billion dollars. The High Line has been successful beyond their dreams; last year, they had about two million people, which was about ten times what was ever estimated.
