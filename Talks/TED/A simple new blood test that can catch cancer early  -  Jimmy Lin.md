# Summary of A simple new blood test that can catch cancer early | Jimmy Lin

Jimmy Lin discusses the importance of early detection in successful cancer treatment and introduces a noninvasive, specific, low-infrastructure, no-radiation, and wide-ranging method of detecting cancer: a simple blood test. Cancer cells shed their DNA into the bloodstream as they grow and die faster than normal cells, and Lin's team uses this to detect cancers early. The method has been tested on cancers in remission, particularly lung cancer, with blood samples collected serially over time. The new blood test has the potential to detect cancer over a hundred days earlier than traditional methods, providing significant time for medical professionals to conduct therapy or surgical interventions. Lin believes that this test could save millions of lives and marks the beginning of the end of the war on cancer.

In this section, Jimmy Lin discusses the intersection of the three most promising developments that have been made in cancer research, including cancer genomics, precision medicine, and immunotherapy. In spite of these groundbreaking strides in the field, the focus is shifting to early detection, which holds the key to successful cancer treatment. Patients diagnosed in stage one are much more likely to survive than those diagnosed in later stages, but currently, the majority of cancer cases are found too late for effective treatment. Understanding the genetic basis of cancers and the individualized nature of treatments are crucial components of early detection.

In this section, Lin explains that current cancer screening methods are either invasive, not very specific, or expose patients to harmful radiation, emphasizing the need for a noninvasive, specific, low-infrastructure, no-radiation, and wide-ranging method to detect cancers while they are still small. The solution is a simple blood test. Because cancer cells grow and die faster than normal cells, their DNA is shed into the bloodstream, and Lin's team uses this to detect cancers early. The method is tested on cancers in remission, particularly lung cancer, with blood samples collected serially over time. A major trial had Professor Charles Swanton of University College London testing the method's efficacy in catching recurrence earlier.

In this section, Jimmy Lin highlights a new blood test that has the potential to detect cancer over a hundred days earlier than traditional methods by identifying the rise of cancer DNA in the blood. This would provide significant time for medical professionals to conduct therapy, surgical interventions, or preventing the cancer from growing or developing resistance. Lin dreams of a future in which two vials of blood drawn as part of a standard physical exam could detect cancer months or even years earlier, potentially saving millions of lives. He believes that we are in the beginning of the end of the war on cancer thanks to this, recent advancements in immunotherapy, and targeted therapies.
