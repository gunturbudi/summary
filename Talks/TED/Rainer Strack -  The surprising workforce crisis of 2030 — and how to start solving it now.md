# Summary of Rainer Strack: The surprising workforce crisis of 2030 â€” and how to start solving it now

Rainer Strack, a business professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen, discusses the global workforce crisis and how it is approaching fast. He recommends that companies develop a people strategy consisting of four parts: forecasting supply and demand for different jobs and skills, attracting great people, educating and upskilling employees, and creating an appreciation and relationship culture. One key factor in solving the crisis is changing employee attitudes.

According to Rainer Strack, by 2030, there will be a global workforce crisis in most of the largest economies, including three out of the four BRIC countries. To address this issue, Germany will have to increase migration, get many more women in the workforce, and adjust retirement age. If Germany fails to do so, Germany will stagnate.

In 2030, there will be a global workforce crisis because there will be a lack of skilled workers to fill jobs. In addition, technology will replace a lot of regular jobs, and the number of people involved in the production of a car has only changed slightly in the last decades despite robots and automation. This means that the world is mobile, but only partly. The least mobile countries are Russia, Germany, and the U.S., while the top choice worldwide is the U.S. The key challenge for governments and businesses is to understand high-skilled people and to find ways to keep them in the workforce.
