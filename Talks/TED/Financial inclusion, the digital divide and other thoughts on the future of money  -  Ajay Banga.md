In this section, Ajay Banga discusses financial inclusion and its importance in fighting poverty and exclusion. He explains that there are close to two billion underbanked or unbanked people in the world who are not able to participate in the financial mainstream and take advantage of things that those who are banked take for granted, such as access to credit and insurance. Banga emphasizes that financial inclusion means having identity, voice, and access to financial servicesâ€”an opportunity for everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status. He further notes that financial inclusion requires partnership and collaboration across the public and private sector to make a real movement on this issue.

In this section, Ajay Banga provides tangible examples of how financial inclusion can benefit small business owners and farmers, such as enabling them to access an electronic economy, receive online payments, and improve their chances of getting a crop loan or credit. While some of these examples require access to a phone, they can be operated equally well on old-fashioned phones, making them accessible to those who don't have smartphones or the internet. However, the digital divide remains an issue in rural parts of the world, and COVID-19 has exposed the bandwith capacity and computer access problems faced by disadvantaged children in urban areas.

In this section, Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga explains how reaching people without access to a phone or internet is crucial when it comes to financial inclusion. He gives the examples of using biometric cards, like with the social security administration in South Africa, to allow people to access benefits and transfer money. Banga also highlights the issue of leakage or theft, where money is lost in the administrative process, emphasizing that technology can help remove middlemen and improve direct government-to-citizen benefits. Regarding the move towards a cashless society, he clarifies that while reducing cash is a good objective, it is not about going completely cashless, but rather about reducing the use of cash in the economy, as cash often facilitates illegal activity.

In this section, Ajay Banga argues that there is a cost of cash that many people have computed, which is somewhere between one to two percent of GDP. He explains that there are efficient uses of that GDP that we could put into play by reducing the role of cash relatively in the economy. He mentions that countries in the Nordics, such as Sweden and South Korea, have reduced the role of cash in their economies, and even they are having a regular, continuous public conversation about not disadvantaging those parts of Sweden who still want to deal in cash. When moving to a cashless society, Banga emphasizes the importance of putting consumers in control of their own data and their own privacy. At Mastercard, they have laid out a set of data principles, which includes getting to a stage where consumers take the responsibility of their data and know what's being collected. The company should collect the minimum amount needed to do their job and keep it safe for consumers, allowing them to remove it when they see fit.
