Kamal Meattle explains how to grow fresh air indoors using three common plants: Areca palm, Mother-in-Law's Tongue, and money plant. These plants remove CO2 and convert it into oxygen, creating a healthy environment for humans. The study found that, in comparison to other buildings, people in the building had a reduced incidence of eye irritation, respiratory systems, headaches, lung impairment, and asthma. This information is available on the government of India website. Kamal and his team are now replicating this study in a 1.75-million-square-foot building, which will have 60,000 indoor plants. This is important for the environment as well as for human health.
