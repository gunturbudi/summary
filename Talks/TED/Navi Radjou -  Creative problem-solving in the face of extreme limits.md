This video explains how mobile telephony can make a solar kit affordable forKenyans, who typically cannot afford such items. By making a daily payment of 45 cents using their mobile phones, Kenyans can unlock the product and start receiving clean, free electricity. This example shows how frugal innovation can be used to solve problems of limited resources in both the North and the South.

Frugal innovation is a solution-based approach to problem-solving that focuses on reducing costs and improving quality of products or services. Three examples of frugal innovation are gThrive, Be-Bound, and Compte Nickel. Nairobi has horrendous traffic jams, and to ease the situation, the engineers at the IBM lab in Kenya are piloting a solution called Megaffic. Megaffic is not as sexy as self-driving cars, but it promises to take Nairobi drivers from point A to point B at least 20 percent faster. UCLA Health launched its Global Lab for Innovation earlier this year, which seeks to identify frugal healthcare solutions anywhere in the world that will be at least 20 percent cheaper than existing solutions in the U.S. and yet more effective.
