# Summary of A Visual History of Human Knowledge | Manuel Lima | TED Talks

Manuel Lima, a design lead at Google, discusses the shift from tree structures to networks as a metaphor to map systems of knowledge and solve complex problems. He explains how the Internet has facilitated the decentralization of organization and collaboration processes, leading to the emergence of networkism. The network metaphor, which embodies notions of decentralization, interconnection, and interdependence, is influencing the traditional art fields of painting and sculpture. Lima emphasizes that networks are not just a trend but a critical new way of thinking required in neuroscience, astrophysics, and other fields of knowledge.

In this section, Manuel Lima, a design lead at Google, explains that over time, the concept of a natural ranking order in the world has shifted from the great chain of being to the branching schema of a tree. Trees have become a powerful metaphor to map a variety of systems of knowledge, including family trees, consanguinity, genealogy, systems of law and all species known to man. However, new complex and intricate challenges that cannot be understood by simply employing a tree diagram are demanding a new metaphor, and it's currently emerging as the network metaphor, which is providing a new lens to understand the world around us. We can now see a shift from trees into networks in many domains of knowledge.

In this section, Manuel Lima talks about the shift from hierarchical tree structures to networks. He explains how the Internet has decentralized the organization and collaboration process, which is different from the top-down structure used before. This section also covers how scientists have discovered that overlaying the tree of life is a network of bacteria, and how ecosystems are much more interdependent than what was learned in school. This metaphor of networks is becoming the syntax of a new language and is influencing traditional art fields like painting and sculpture, driving the new art movement he calls "networkism."

In this section, Manuel Lima discusses "networkism," which involves the cross-pollination of science and art to create intricate and complex networks that embody notions of decentralization, interconnection, and interdependence. He showcases various examples of networkism, from a computer-generated map of a social network to massive installations using only elastic ropes. Lima emphasizes that networks are not just a new trend but a critical new way of thinking that is required to solve complex problems in neuroscience, astrophysics, and various other fields of knowledge.
