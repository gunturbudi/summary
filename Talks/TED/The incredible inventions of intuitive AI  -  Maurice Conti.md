# Summary of The incredible inventions of intuitive AI | Maurice Conti

Maurice Conti's TED talk focuses on the Augmented Age, where human capabilities will be augmented by computational and robotic systems. Computers are transitioning from logic to intuition, increasing their accuracy and ability to work with humans to solve complex problems. Conti provides examples of advanced robotics, generative AI design, and the development of a digital nervous system that connects humans to their creations. The talk concludes by highlighting the exciting potential of intuitive AI and the incredible inventions it has the power to create, leading to a partnership between technology, nature, and humanity.

In this section of the talk, Maurice Conti discusses the Augmented Age, in which human capabilities will be augmented by computational systems, robotic systems, and a digital nervous system. He describes how tools are making the leap from being passive to being generative, using generative design tools that use a computer and algorithms to synthesize geometry and come up with new designs by exploring the entire solution space based on the user's defined goals and constraints. He provides an example of creating an aerial drone chassis whereby a generative design AI is used to come up with the best possible design solution based on the user's criteria, and how generative design AI will be used to create a 3D-printed cabin partition that's half the weight of the original and stronger that will be flying on the Airbus A320 later this year.

In this section, Maurice Conti discusses the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and how computers are transitioning from logic to intuition. He gives examples of how computers have achieved success in games like Jeopardy and Go, and notes that the machines are developing an understanding of intuition, increasing their accuracy and ability to work with humans to solve complex problems. He goes on to describe how the era of human augmentation is about robots and humans working together, utilizing each otherâ€™s strengths. Maurice gives examples of advanced robotics, such as Bishop, which are capable of interacting with humans in a natural, intuitive way, and how AI is being used to direct the actions of humans and robots in complex problem-solving scenarios.

In this section, Conti discusses a project in which his team is working with Amsterdam-based artist Joris Laarman to robotically print the world's first autonomously manufactured bridge with the help of an AI that generatively designs it. Computers are going to augment human's ability to imagine and design new things, and this would lead to creating stuff that has never been made before with the help of robotic systems. However, we still lack a nervous system connecting us to all the things we design, make, and use. That's why they are working on digital nervous systems that allow us to be connected to our creations so that we can change from wanting to convince people to buy things we've made to creating things that people want in the first place.

In this final section of the video, Maurice Conti concludes his talk by stating that a future characterized by a partnership between technology, nature, and humanity is well worth looking forward to. He emphasizes that how these things will be shaped will be influenced by this new relationship, highlighting the exciting potential of intuitive AI and the incredible inventions it has the power to create. The talk ends with applause from the audience.
