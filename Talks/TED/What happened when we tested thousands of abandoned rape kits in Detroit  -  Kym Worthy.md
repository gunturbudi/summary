# Summary of What happened when we tested thousands of abandoned rape kits in Detroit | Kym Worthy

Kym Worthy, Prosecuting Attorney of Wayne County, Detroit, discovered over 11,000 abandoned rape kits in a warehouse which led to the identification of over 800 serial rapists whose crime sprees could have been prevented if their DNA had been tested earlier. She implemented a tracking system to monitor the kits and ensure accountability, which led to a statewide rape kit tracking system being developed. Worthy emphasizes the importance of private sector help in developing information management systems and campaigns to stop sexual assault by changing the culture. She stresses the severity of the national pandemic of untested, abandoned rape kits and shares examples of women who have been raped while waiting for friends or in their own homes.

In this section of the video, Kym Worthy, the prosecutor for Wayne County, Michigan talks about discovering over 11,000 abandoned rape kits in a warehouse. These kits represented victims who had voluntarily undergone a grueling process with the hopes of finding their perpetrator. The oldest kit belonged to an eight-year-old girl who was raped with a level of violence that is hard to fathom. The fact that these kits were abandoned and untested allowed perpetrators to walk free for years, committing more crimes with impunity.

In this section, Kym Worthy, Prosecuting Attorney of Wayne County, Detroit, shares the story of two survivors whose rape kits were left untested for 15 years because of the high cost of testing. Because DNA evidence is crucial in identifying a perpetrator, Worthy pushed to change state laws that would require the immediate testing of every rape kit released by the victim. She also implemented a tracking system, similar to those used by logistics companies, to monitor the kits and ensure accountability. The backlog of 11,341 rape kits had resulted from multiple police leadership changes, inadequate training for sex crimes officers, chronic understaffing, and victim blaming. Worthy's efforts and the system she created helped identify over 800 serial rapists whose crime sprees could have been stopped if their DNA had been tested earlier.

In this section, Kym Worthy explains how her office collaborated with UPS to develop a tracking system for new rape kits that came in, from the time they were collected to the time they were tested in the lab and returned to the police personnel, guaranteeing that not a single rape kit got lost for 16 months of the pilot program. State officials took notice of this innovative system and decided to develop a statewide rape kit tracking system using state funds. As of June 28, 2018, the project identified 2,600 suspects, 861 serial rapists, and discovered that 40 states had tentacles to the crime testing of these rape kits.

In this section, Kym Worthy highlights the importance of private sector help in developing information management systems and campaigns to stop sexual assault by changing the culture of rape victims being too afraid to come forward.

She stresses the severity of the national pandemic of untested, abandoned rape kits and shares examples of women who have been raped in various locations while waiting for friends or even in their own homes. Finally, she expresses her sorrow for the victims of rape and underscores the importance of timely rape-kit testing in preventing future sexual assaults.
