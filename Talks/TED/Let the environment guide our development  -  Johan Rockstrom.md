In order to avoid large-scale damage to the planet, humanity needs to adopt a new paradigm in which we take into account the interactions between multiple systems. Systems theory can help us identify points at which changes in one system may lead to changes in another, allowing us to identify boundaries within which we can safely operate. Rockstrom discusses the findings of a study published in "Nature" in 2009, which identified nine planetary boundaries within which humanity can maintain a sustainable existence. These include climate, biodiversity, and key resources.
