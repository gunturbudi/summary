In this section, the speaker, Charity Tillemann-Dick, discusses her journey as an opera singer diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, a condition that usually leads to death after two to five years. Despite a specialist's warning to stop singing, the speaker refused to give up her passion. With the help of Reda Girgis and his team at Johns Hopkins, the speaker made trade-offs, including moving to Baltimore, enrolling in a nearby conservatory, giving up salt, going vegan, and taking large doses of sildenafil. However, these were not enough, and the speaker had to undergo a big gun treatment called Flolan, which involves attaching a catheter, a pump, and administering medicine directly to the heart 24 hours a day. The treatment was not preferable, but it allowed her to walk again and even perform within a few weeks.
