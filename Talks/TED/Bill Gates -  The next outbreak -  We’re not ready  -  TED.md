# Summary of Bill Gates: The next outbreak? Weâ€™re not ready | TED

Bill Gates discusses the dangers of global epidemics and the lack of readiness to deal with them.

Gates makes the case that we are not prepared to deal with epidemics, and that if something catastrophic were to happen, it could be far worse than the Ebola epidemic.
