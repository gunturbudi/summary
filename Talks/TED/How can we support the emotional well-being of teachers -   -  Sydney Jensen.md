In this section of the video, the speaker, Sydney Jensen, describes the challenges teachers face in being an emotional support system for their students, especially for those who come from tough backgrounds. She explains that while good teaching has changed over the years, and teachers now emphasize communication and relationship-building with students, providing emotional support is often challenging as teachers themselves face the burden of their students' trauma, which they take home with them. Jensen also shares how one of her experiences with a student, where she didn't even know what his voice sounded like, made her realize that building meaningful relationships with students is crucial, and this realization prompted her to change her teaching style.
