In this section, Peter Singer highlights the issue of preventable, poverty-related deaths of children, as well as the notion of effective altruism. Singer argues that it is morally irrelevant whether the children suffering are far away or of a different race, so long as we can reduce child mortality rates. He notes that each of us spends money on unnecessary things that we could instead donate to organizations like the Against Malaria Foundation which can use that money to protect children from malaria. Effective altruism, he argues, is important because it combines empathy for those suffering with an effective and evidence-based approach to use our resources to make a meaningful impact.
