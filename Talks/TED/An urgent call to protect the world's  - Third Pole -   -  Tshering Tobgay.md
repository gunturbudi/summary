# Summary of An urgent call to protect the world's "Third Pole" | Tshering Tobgay

Former Bhutanese Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay highlights the urgent need to protect the melting glaciers in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region, as it could have devastating consequences on the 240 million people living in the area and the 1.6 billion people downstream who depend on the region's rivers for water and agriculture. Tobgay proposes the establishment of a high-level intergovernmental organization called the Third Pole Council, consisting of all eight countries in the region, to monitor the health of the glaciers and fight climate change. He calls on China and India, which are major polluters, to lead the global fight against climate change and reduce their greenhouse gases, stressing that the time to act is now.

In this section, former Bhutanese Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay shares his awakening experience after hearing a report by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) stating that one-third of ice on Nepal's Hindu Kush Himalaya mountains could melt by the end of the century. Tobgay acknowledges that glaciers in his country have been melting for some time, but the ICIMOD report warns that glaciers in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region are much more vulnerable than previously thought due to the creation of glacial lakes, which could rapidly melt glaciers and cause unprecedented flash floods in his country, wreaking havoc on his people's way of life.

In this section, the speaker explains the dire consequences of the melting glaciers on the 240 million people residing in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region, and the 1.6 billion people living downstream who depend on the water provided by the region's rivers for agriculture and drinking. The melting glaciers lead to more intense rain, flash floods, more landslides, and glacial lake outburst floods, which would all cause unimaginable destruction in the area with some of the poorest people. The rest of the world also stands to be affected by the potential destabilization caused by tens of millions of climate refugees who might be forced to move due to the melting glaciers.

In this section, Tshering Tobgay proposes the establishment of a high-level intergovernmental organization called the Third Pole Council, consisting of all eight countries located in the region. Its purpose would be to protect the third-largest repository of ice and the billions of people who depend on it. Tobgay urges all stakeholders to work together to monitor the health of the glaciers, shape and implement policies for protection, and fight climate change together with a renewed sense of urgency. He calls on China and India to reduce their greenhouse gases, control their pollution, and lead the global fight against climate change, stressing that the time to act is now. Otherwise, the consequences could be disastrous for regions dependent on the glaciers, such as the Maldives, which may be completely submerged due to rising sea levels.
