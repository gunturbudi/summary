# Summary of Steven Johnson: How humanity doubled life expectancy in a century | TED

Steven Johnson's TED Talk focuses on the doubling of global life expectancy in just one century, highlighting the importance of vaccines, persuasion, bureaucratic institutions, and institutional innovation. He discusses the role of persuasion in convincing people to adopt new practices, citing pasteurization as an example, and underlines the significance of bureaucratic institutions that were responsible for the production and distribution of drugs, even if they were initially toxic. Johnson stresses the need for institutional innovation in the healthcare industry, referencing the tragedy of Elixir Sulfanilamide, and the creation of regulatory bodies such as the FDA. Lastly, he urges the need to close the gap between health span and lifespan, underscoring the importance of addressing gaps in health outcomes.

In this section, Steven Johnson discusses the remarkable achievement of doubling global life expectancy in just one century. He explains that 100 years ago, the average global life expectancy was in the mid-30s, but today it is just over 70. Johnson also highlights how infant mortality has dramatically reduced and that life expectancy is not an illusion, as half of the population did not make it past the age of 45 a century ago. While this progress has led to overpopulation and climate issues, Johnson believes that it is crucial to understand how we accomplished this remarkable achievement.

In this section, the speaker highlights that vaccines were one of the primary movers that allowed humanity to double life expectancy in the past century. However, he also argues that focusing solely on science and tangible objects underestimates the crucial role of persuasion in achieving societal change. The example of pasteurization demonstrates the importance of convincing people to adopt new practices, which necessitates not only the scientific solution but also champions from within society. The speaker also emphasizes the significance of bureaucratic institutions, which were responsible for the production and distribution of drugs that were often toxic to human health in the early 20th century.

In this section, the speaker discusses the need for institutional innovation in the healthcare industry. The tragedy of Elixir Sulfanilamide in 1937 led to new regulations, such as mandating that pharma companies show that their drugs were not harmful to consumers, and the creation of regulatory bodies like the FDA, to ensure that fake cures were separated from real ones. With new research suggesting that humans can live for decades longer, even indefinitely, some are working to tackle the problem of aging itself. However, the speaker emphasizes the importance of addressing the gaps in health outcomes and reducing the difference between health span and lifespan. The second revolution in human health should be about closing these gaps with the tools we have at our disposal.
