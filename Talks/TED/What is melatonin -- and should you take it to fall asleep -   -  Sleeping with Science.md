# Summary of What is melatonin -- and should you take it to fall asleep? | Sleeping with Science

Melatonin is a hormone produced by the brain to signal the body it's time to sleep, but buying it as a sleep aid may not be that effective as studies show that it only reduces the time to fall asleep by less than 4 minutes and improves sleep quality by only 2.2 percent. The purity and strength of the supplements are not well-regulated in several countries, making it unreliable. It is better to focus on optimizing sleep with basic habits like regularity, cool bedroom temperature, darkness in the evening, getting enough daylight, and physical activity instead of relying on melatonin.
