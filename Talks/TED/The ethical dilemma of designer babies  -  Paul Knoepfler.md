# Summary of The ethical dilemma of designer babies | Paul Knoepfler

In the video, "The Ethical Dilemma of Designer Babies," Paul Knoepfler reflects on the potential consequences of genetic modification for designer babies. He warns of the dangers of eugenics and the possibility of misuse of CRISPR technology by people seeking to profit or push ideological agendas. While genetic modification may have benefits, Knoepfler argues for a moratorium on creating genetically modified humans as he believes it is too unpredictable and risky. He stresses the importance of educating the public on this issue and encouraging participation in discussions and decisions around genetic modification.

In this section, Paul Knoepfler paints a vivid picture of the potential reality of designer babies through a scenario that takes place in 2030 involving two children, one who is a natural and another who is a genetically modified designer baby using CRISPR technology that is healthier and possesses many desirable traits. Knoepfler highlights the potential issues with designer babies, including unsettling feelings and issues that may arise, such as increased aggressiveness and narcissism. He also raises concerns about the ethical implications of designer babies and the fact that researchers in China have already reported the creation of genetically modified human embryos using CRISPR technology.

In this section of the transcript, Paul Knoepfler explains that while in some countries it would be illegal to create designer babies, there is currently no law against it in the US or some other countries. He also discusses the development of CRISPR technology, explaining how it works and how it has revolutionized genetic modification research. However, Knoepfler expresses concern that some may misuse the technology and pursue designer babies for profit or ideological reasons. He warns of the dangers of eugenics, citing his own family's experience with it in Vienna in the 20th century, and urges caution as we continue to explore the possibilities and potential consequences of genetic engineering.

In this section, the speaker discusses the potential negative consequences of using genetic modification for designer babies. While some proponents of this technology argue it could create healthier and better humans, there is a risk of making people sicker or damaging the entire field of genetic modification research. Furthermore, governments may start to compel citizens to go the designer baby route if it results in lower healthcare costs, while the trend of designer babies becoming fashionable and trendy on social media could be difficult to control. The speaker also notes that while genetic modification could have its benefits, we must be aware of its dangers and look to previous scientific breakthroughs for lessons in how transformative science can permeate society.

In this section, Paul Knoepfler addresses the dilemma surrounding designer babies and argues for a moratorium on creating genetically modified humans as he believes that it is too dangerous and unpredictable. However, he notes that there are people who disagree with him and feel that creating designer babies is the right direction to go in. He also discusses the importance of educating the public on this issue and encouraging them to participate in discussions and decisions around genetic modification. He ends by posing a thought-provoking scenario where parents are faced with the choice of having regular children or designer babies and how it might impact their decisions in the future.
