In this section, Ben Kacyra, the creator of the first 3D mapping system, demonstrates the power of the technology by scanning the audience while he speaks. The digitization of the audience is displayed on a screen and viewers can fly through the cloud of points and zoom in on an individual to show the high level of detail capable. Kacyra gives thanks to his partners Historic Scotland and the Glasgow School of Art, as well as the Director of Conservation at Historic Scotland and the Head of Visualization at the Glasgow School of Art.
