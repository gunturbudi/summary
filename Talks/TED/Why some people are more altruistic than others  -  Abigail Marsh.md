# Summary of Why some people are more altruistic than others | Abigail Marsh

Abigail Marsh shares her research on the brains of psychopaths and highly altruistic individuals in this video. Psychopaths lack the ability to recognize fearful expressions, likely due to their underreactive and smaller amygdalas. On the other hand, highly altruistic people have larger and more reactive amygdalas, better recognition of fearful expressions, and a view of compassion that extends beyond their inner circle, indicating humility. Marsh believes that while some may be more sensitive to the suffering of others, the ability to expand the circle of compassion outward is within reach for almost everyone. She also highlights the evidence of increases in different types of altruism and decreases in violence and cruelty happening all around the world due to the increase in global wealth and standards of living.

In this section, the speaker shares a personal story of a man who saved her life, which led her to become a psychology researcher investigating the roots of extraordinary altruism. While some believe human nature to be fundamentally selfish, the speaker examines the selfless actions of highly altruistic people and suggests that their brains may be different in fundamental ways. To understand this, she starts from the opposite end with psychopaths, who are missing the desire to help others. Studies show that psychopathic individuals exhibit three characteristics, including insensitivity to signs of other people's distress and difficulty recognizing fearful facial expressions.

In this section, Abigail Marsh discusses the brains of psychopaths and extraordinary altruists. Psychopaths lack the ability to recognize fearful expressions in others that usually elicits compassion, likely because their amygdalas are underreactive to these cues and are smaller than average. Conversely, Marsh's research on a population of extraordinary altruists, people who have given one of their own kidneys to a complete stranger, found that their brains have special characteristics such as better recognition of fearful expressions, a more reactive and larger amygdala, and a view of compassion that extends beyond their inner circle, indicating humility. Marsh believes that this view of the world is attainable by many people.

In this section, the speaker discusses how, at the societal level, there is evidence of expansions of altruism and compassion happening all around the world. This has led to decreases in various forms of violence and cruelty and increases in different types of altruism like donating blood, bone marrow and even kidneys to complete strangers. According to the speaker, the root of these changes seems to be the increase in global wealth and standards of living, as people tend to turn their focus of attention outward as society improves. However, even as the world becomes more humane, there is a perception that it's becoming worse and crueler. The speaker believes this may be due to people learning more about the suffering of strangers in distant places and caring more about it. The speaker concludes by saying that while some people may be more sensitive to the suffering of others, the ability to expand the circle of compassion outward is within reach for almost everyone.
