# Summary of E.O. Wilson: Advice to young scientists

E.O. Wilson advises young scientists to acquire breadth in related and distant fields, not to be afraid of math, and to focus on a subject that interests them deeply. He encourages them to study difficult problems to find opportunities for scientific discoveries and to become experts in their chosen area of study, ideally a less popular one, to make quick advances and increase their potential for success. Wilson also explains that there are two strategies for research, to identify a problem or to study a subject broadly, and offers Wilson's Principle Number One, which advocates collaboration with mathematicians. He concludes by stating that the years ahead will see significant advances in science and medicine, and young scientists have chosen a rewarding and fulfilling career.

Detail Summary:

In this section, E.O. Wilson, a prominent scientist, urges young scientists to go as far as they can in their field because the world needs them badly and humanity is now fully into the techno-scientific age. As knowledge in medical science and science overall is doubling every 15 to 20 years, it is essential for young scientists to keep their eyes lifted, head turning, and acquire breadth in other related and distant fields to be able to describe an explanation of networks, principles, and laws. Although mathematics is an essential asset to a scientific career, one should not worry if they lack mathematical skills since many successful scientists today are mathematically semi-literate.

In this section, E.O. Wilson advises young scientists to not be afraid of math and to understand that mathematics is a language that can be mastered at any age with practice. He argues that technical skills are not as important as imagination and the ability to form concepts. Wilson suggests that scientists should choose a subject that interests them deeply and focus on that, but also encourages them to take a part of their chosen discipline that is sparsely inhabited to judge opportunity, while still acquiring older mentors for guidance. In addition, he offers Wilson's Principle Number One, which states that it is easier for scientists to collaborate with mathematicians than the other way around.

In this section, E.O. Wilson advises young scientists to find a field and subject that is not yet popular in order to make quick advances and increase their potential for success. He encourages them to become experts in their chosen area of study, and to study difficult problems in order to find opportunities for scientific discoveries. Wilson also explains that there are two strategies for research: one is to identify a problem and work towards its solution, while the other is to study a subject broadly in search of interesting phenomena or patterns. He concludes by stating that the decades ahead will see dramatic advances in science and medicine, and that young scientists have chosen a calling that will provide them with a lifetime of satisfaction.
