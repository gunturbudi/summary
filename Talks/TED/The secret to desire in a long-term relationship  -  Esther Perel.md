# Summary of The secret to desire in a long-term relationship | Esther Perel

In this video, social psychologist and philosopher Esther Perel discusses the concept of desire in a long-term relationship. She explains that while initial desire is often strong, over time the intensity of that desire often decreases due to the amount of connection and responsibility that is involved in a long-term relationship. Perel advises couples to have lots of sexual privacy and to focus on foreplay rather than the main event. She also suggests that couples understand that passion waxes and wanes and that passion can be brought back by Reigniting Passion.

The speaker travels the world and observes that where romanticism has taken hold, there is a crisis of desire. This crisis is often a result of the imagination not being able to reconcile the two needs of security and adventure.

This video discusses the concept of erotic intelligence, or the ability to be turned on by oneself and one's partner, without needing either to take care of the other or be needy. The three most common answers to the question of when someone is most drawn to their partner are when they are away, when they are apart, and when they are in their element. Each of these points is associated with some aspect of the partner that the person is drawn to.

According to Esther Perel, the key to experiencing desire over a long period of time is to cultivate imagination, playfulness, novelty, and curiosity. Trauma can also be a catalyst for desire, as survivors of the Holocaust understand the erotic as an antidote to death. She asks "I shut myself off when ..." to get a sense of when someone turns themselves off from desire. Most people want better sex, which she defines as reconnecting with the vitality, vibrancy, and aliveness that sex used to afford them or that they've hoped it would afford them.
