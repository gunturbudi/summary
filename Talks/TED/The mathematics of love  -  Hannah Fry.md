# Summary of The mathematics of love | Hannah Fry

Mathematicians have found that attractiveness and popularity on online dating websites do not always correlate. In order to maximize their chances of finding the perfect partner, some people follow the mathematical principle of optimal stopping theory, which dictates that in the first 37 percent of a person's dating window, they should reject anyone they deem as potential marriage material. However, this method comes with some risks, such as the potential of being rejected by the person you're interested in and dying alone.

Mathematicians have studied the mathematics of love for years and have found that attractiveness and popularity on online dating websites do not always correlate. For example, Sarah Jessica Parker is much more popular than Portia de Rossi despite having a lower attractiveness rating.

Top Tip #2 is for people who are in the rejection phase of relationships. The strategy is to reject them and then imagine the next person to come along is marginally less boring and dull than everybody that you've seen before. If you follow the math, you have to marry them and end up in a relationship which is, frankly, suboptimal.
Top Tip #3 is for avoiding divorce. One of the most important predictors for whether or not a couple is going to get divorced is how positive or negative each partner is being in the conversation. Couples that are very low-risk on Gottman's scale score a lot more positive points than negative. The equation also predicts how the wife is going to respond in her next turn of the conversation, how positive or negative she's going to be, and how much the husband and wife influence one another.

The mathematics of love has shown that the best couples are those with a low negativity threshold. These are the couples that don't let anything go unnoticed and allow each other some room to complain.
