# Summary of Richard Resnick: Welcome to the genomic revolution

In this video, Richard Resnick speaks about the advancement of genomics and genetic sequencing, with the ability to sequence human genomes doubling, tripling or quadrupling in the foreseeable future. Resnick shares examples of how these advancements can have a remarkable impact on medicine and treatment, such as identifying gene deletion that predicts a 90% likelihood of cancer in one's life and accurately diagnosing dopa-responsive dystonia in the Beery twins to provide better treatment. He also shares two examples of how whole-genome sequencing led to life-saving treatments for children. Resnick discusses the implications of genomics, including the rise of consumer genomics applications, the potential for genetic information to influence politics and society and the importance of using this technology responsibly.

In this section, the speaker discusses the remarkable progress made in genomics and genetic sequencing, with the capacity to sequence human genomes doubling, tripling, or quadrupling year over year forseeable future. The speaker gives examples of how these advancements can have huge implications for medicine and treatment, including identifying a gene deletion that predicts a 90% likelihood of cancer in one's life, and accurately diagnosing the Beery twins with dopa-responsive dystonia, which allowed for better symptomatic treatment.

In this section of the video, Richard Resnick shares two examples of how whole-genome sequencing led to life-saving treatments for children. One child had a mutation in a gene responsible for producing serotonin, but after being given a serotonin precursor drug on top of L-Dopa, the child was effectively normal. The other child had a single-point mutation in a gene responsible for controlling programmed cell death, which informed a treatment for bone marrow transplant, and after nine months of recovery, he was able to eat steak with A1 sauce. Resnick also discusses the implications of genomics, including the ability to sequence and compare genomes across the planet, the rise of consumer applications for genomics, and the potential for genetic information to influence politics and society.

In this section of the video, Richard Resnick discusses the potential implications of the genomic revolution, including an app that can connect individuals based on their DNA and the fact that a small percentage of fathers may not actually be the biological fathers of their children. Resnick emphasizes the importance of using this technology responsibly and urges viewers to pay attention to and influence the genomic revolution.
