# Summary of How we can teach computers to make sense of our emotions | Raphael Arar

This YouTube video discusses the difficulties in teaching computers to understand human emotions. The speaker uses art as a way to explore these deeper questions and shows the results of a study in which people's nostalgia scores were used to create light-based sculptures. The video discusses the difficulties in translating human behavior to computers, and how this can lead to communicating with machines that sound mechanical and creepy. The artist explains that intuition is what helps humans create amazing things, and that computers need to learn how to access this intuition in order to create truly human-like conversations.

In this video, a researcher discusses how they are working to create technology that can understand human emotions. They explain that in order to do this, the technology has to be just as human as it is artificial and it has to get inside of people's heads. The researcher discusses how they use art as a way to explore these deeper questions, and they show the results of a study in which people's nostalgia scores were used to create light-based sculptures.

The video discusses the difficulties in translating human behavior to computers, and how this can lead to communicating with machines that sound mechanical and creepy. The artist creates a piece called Bot to Bot, which puts one conversational system against another and exposes it to the general public. Bot to Bot tries to mimic human conversation, but falls short. The artist explains that intuition is what helps humans create amazing things, and that computers need to learn how to access this intuition in order to create truly human-like conversations.
