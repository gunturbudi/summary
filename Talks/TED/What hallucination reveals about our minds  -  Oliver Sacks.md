# Summary of What hallucination reveals about our minds | Oliver Sacks

Oliver Sacks discusses how hallucinations reveal information about the workings of the brain. He discusses how common hallucinations are among people who are visually impaired, and how they are not always disturbing. He also discusses how hallucinations can be interesting and valuable for gaining insight into how the brain works.

The old woman in question had never experienced a hallucination before, and was relieved to learn that she has Charles Bonnet syndromeâ€”a condition that is nothing to be concerned about.
