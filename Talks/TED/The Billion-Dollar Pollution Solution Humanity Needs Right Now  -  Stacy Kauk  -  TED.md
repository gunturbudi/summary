# Summary of The Billion-Dollar Pollution Solution Humanity Needs Right Now | Stacy Kauk | TED

Stacy Kauk, Head of Sustainability at Shopify, discusses the need for investment in carbon removal and the challenges facing the industry. She introduces the Advance Market Commitment (AMC), which guarantees a future market for carbon removal and sets up a fund called Frontier worth almost one billion dollars. Kauk highlights the underdeveloped ecosystem for carbon removal and advocates for experimentation and practice to build skills and learn from the implementation of carbon removal technologies. She discusses three companies using different methods to capture and store carbon dioxide and emphasizes the importance of achieving results within set parameters. Additionally, she suggests Shopify has the opportunity to help its millions of entrepreneurs become carbon-neutral and create a market for carbon removal companies while driving innovation in the industry.

In this section, Stacy Kauk, Head of Sustainability at Shopify, discusses the need for more money to invest in carbon removal and the launch of an Advance Market Commitment (AMC) to guarantee a future market for carbon removal. The AMC borrows the idea of a purchase guarantee from the health care sector's use of AMCs to accelerate the development of vaccines. The AMC will try to accelerate the development and scaling of carbon removal by setting up a fund called Frontier, which is almost one billion dollars. However, Frontier faces significant differences between vaccine development and carbon removal, as vaccine development has been done for a long time and we have largely worked out the supply chain and infrastructure challenges, operational issues, and policy definitions.

In this section, the speaker highlights the challenges facing the new industry of carbon removal, stating that while it has tremendous potential, it is still in a developmental stage. Unlike established vaccine companies, there are only a few early-stage carbon removal companies in operation, and there is a lack of clean power at the scale and distribution necessary to drive carbon removal. The ecosystem for carbon removal is underdeveloped, and the largest facility in operation today has an annual capacity of only 4,000 tonnes, which is orders of magnitude less than what is needed. She suggests that, to supercharge progress, both a demand pull and a supply push are needed, and advocates for experimentation and practice to build skills and learn from the actual implementation of carbon removal technologies.

In this section, the speaker discusses three companies that are using different methods to capture and store carbon dioxide. The first company, Carbon Engineering, uses direct air capture machines to filter CO2 and store it, while Running Tide sinks kelp in the ocean to lock away carbon captured through photosynthesis. Heirloom is a company that aims to accelerate the natural capacity of limestone to react and capture CO2 by speeding up absorption rates from a year to just days. The speaker highlights the diversity of solutions and emphasizes the importance of achieving results within set parameters. Furthermore, she mentions that Shopify, a carbon-neutral company, has the opportunity to leverage carbon removal and help its millions of entrepreneurs become carbon-neutral as well, creating a market for carbon removal companies and driving innovation in the industry.
