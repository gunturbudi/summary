# Summary of How nanoparticles could change the way we treat cancer | Joy Wolfram

Nanoparticles have the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment by delivering cancer drugs to the heart of tumors. Through nanoparticle technology, drugs have more time to find the tumor and be delivered to the correct location. Despite significant progress, there are still challenges, such as the liver recognizing foreign objects and destroying nanoparticles. However, researchers have found solutions, such as using a malaria drug and biological nanoparticles found naturally in the body. Joy Wolfram emphasizes the importance of teamwork and dedication in the fight against cancer, and believes that nanomedicines can reduce harm to healthy organs, improve quality of life, and save future patients. Her ultimate hope is for a future where cancer treatment allows for celebrations like weddings instead of funerals.

In this section, Joy Wolfram, a researcher in nanoparticle technology, explains how nanoparticles can transport cancer drugs to the heart of the tumor and revolutionize cancer treatment. Often, cancer drugs are washed out of the body too quickly to reach the tumor, but nanoparticles are too big to be washed out and can circulate, giving them more time to find the tumor. By loading cancer drugs inside nanoparticles, nanoparticles can function as the carrier to bring the cancer drugs to the right location, like a fire truck. Nanoparticles can be made out of various materials and are approximately 400 stacked on top of each other to match the thickness of a single hair strand.

In this section, Joy Wolfram discusses some challenges and limitations faced by currently approved nanoparticles for cancer treatment. One of the major challenges is the liver, which recognizes and destroys foreign objects, including nanoparticles, thereby preventing these nanoparticles from reaching the tumor. To overcome this challenge, researchers have found that a 70-year-old malaria drug could help stop immune cells in the liver from eating the nanoparticles, allowing them to escape and continue their journey to the tumor. Another approach is to use biological nanoparticles found naturally in the body to deliver cancer drugs, which are less likely to be recognized as foreign by the liver. Wolfram's lab has developed a method for processing large quantities of liquid from the body to produce a highly concentrated, high-quality formulation of biological nanoparticles.

In this section, Joy Wolfram emphasizes the importance of teamwork and dedication from scientists and physicians in the battle against cancer. She also credits the inspiration from patients who have experienced the harsh realities of cancer for keeping them motivated to find a cure. Wolfram believes that the development of nanomedicines will not only reduce harm to healthy organs but also improve the quality of life and save future patients. She concludes with a hopeful message, imagining a future where cancer treatments allow for celebrations like weddings instead of funerals.
