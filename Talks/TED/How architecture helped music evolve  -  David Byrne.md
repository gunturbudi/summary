In this section, David Byrne explains how changes to concert halls and the introduction of microphones affected the evolution of music. As concert halls got bigger, music became less rhythmic and more textural to accommodate the reverberation. With the introduction of microphones, singers like Frank Sinatra and Chet Baker were able to create a new style of music that was impossible without recorded music or live performing musicians. This led to the creation of new types of music, such as disco and hip-hop, where dancers liked certain parts of songs that were looped and improvised by the MCs.

He explains how pop music today, to some extent, is written for a personal listening experience where details can be heard, but the dynamic of the music doesn't change that much. Byrne also draws a parallel to birds and how they adapt their calls to different environments. He concludes that music creation is evolutionary and adaptive, with the vessel for music instinctively and intuitively created first, followed by the passion it will be injected into.

He concludes by likening humans to birds who adapt and sing, but still experience joy despite changing circumstances.
