# Summary of The next step in nanotechnology | George Tulevski

George Tulevski discusses the potential of nanomaterials in technology but also acknowledges the challenges in working with them. Nanomaterials are small particles that require tools that are not yet available to us. He focuses on the use of carbon nanotubes in computing and the challenge of arranging billions of these particles to create a single computer chip. Tulevski's team used chemistry to arrange these particles into a pattern and build circuits that are faster than any nanomaterials used before. Chemistry became the missing tool that allowed them to build from the bottom-up, like nature, and deliver on one of the original promises of nanotechnology. He emphasizes the need for new scientists and tools like chemistry to help realize the potential of this technology in areas such as renewable energy, medicine, and structural materials.

In this section, George Tulevski speaks about the potential of nanomaterials in technology, but also the challenges that exist in working with them. Nanotechnology is a field governed by quantum mechanics, which allows precise tuning of nanomaterials by making small changes. Tulevski, who has worked with nanomaterials, has seen a lot of science breakthroughs in the field, but not many of them have been translated into new technologies that could impact people's lives. One major obstacle is that nanomaterials are very small and difficult to work with, requiring tools that are not yet available to us. Although nanomaterials hold a lot of potential in a range of areas such as computing, medicine, and space elevators, there is still much work to be done before these technologies can become a reality.

In this section, George Tulevski discusses the use of carbon nanotubes and their electronic properties that could lead to a ten-fold improvement in computing performance. However, the challenge lies in arranging billions of these particles to create a single computer chip. To solve this problem, Tulevski's team turned to nature and used chemistry to arrange and steer these particles into a pattern and build circuits that are faster than any nanomaterials used before. Chemistry became the missing tool that allowed them to build from the bottom-up, like nature, and deliver on one of the original promises of nanotechnology. Tulevski emphasizes that the development of new tools in nanotechnology will require new scientists and new tools like chemistry to help realize the potential of this technology in areas such as renewable energy, medicine, and structural materials.
