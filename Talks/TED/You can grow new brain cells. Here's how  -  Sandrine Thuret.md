# Summary of You can grow new brain cells. Here's how | Sandrine Thuret

In the video, Sandrine Thuret discusses how the adult brain can generate new nerve cells. This process is important for learning and memory, as well as the quality of those memories. Neurogenesis is also important for depression, as it helps to increase the efficacy of antidepressants.

In the video, Sandrine Thuret discusses how the adult brain can generate new nerve cells. It is still unclear how many new cells are generated, but by the time someone is 50, they have replaced all of the cells they were born with. This process is important for learning and memory, as well as the quality of those memories. Neurogenesis is also important for depression, as it helps to increase the efficacy of antidepressants.

The video discusses the research on neurogenesis, which shows that different activities (such as learning, stress, sleep deprivation, and sex) can either increase or decrease the production of new neurons in the hippocampus. It is also shown that what you eat can have an effect on the production of new neurons, and that Japanese groups are fascinated by food textures and their impact on mental health. Finally, it is mentioned that neurogenesis is important for understanding the function of new neurons and for protection of Robert's patients.

Sandrine Thuret discusses the benefits of neurogenesis, or the growth of new brain cells. She says that anything that increases the production of oxygen to the brain should be beneficial. This includes aerobic exercise, but also other forms of physical activity.
