Douglas Rushkoff talks about the digital future and how it is not a matter of rejecting the digital or rejecting the technological, but of retrieving the values that we are in danger of leaving behind and embedding them in the digital infrastructure for the future. He talks about how we can make a social network that teaches us to see our adversaries as people, create an economy that doesn't favor a platform monopoly, build platforms that don't repress our creativity, and spend our time and energy making the world a place that we don't feel the need to escape from. He says that, even if we are not perfect, at least we will not be alone.
