Peer-to-peer communication can spread positive social norms, and using an app like Ducky can allow individuals and companies to log and track their sustainable actions. Stoknes emphasizes crafting better stories that highlight the heroes making real change happen and encourages reimaging climate as the living air around us.

In this section, Per Espen Stoknes discusses the five inner defenses that prevent people from engaging in solving global warming. The first is distance, where people feel helpless because the issue seems so far away from them. The second is doom, causing people to become fearful and then desensitized to the issue. The third is dissonance, where individuals feel inner discomfort because their personal actions contradict their knowledge of fossil fuel use's impact on global warming. They then create justifications to assuage this guilt or even doubt climate science to feel better, thereby brushing off the problem.
