# Summary of Didier Sornette: How we can predict the next financial crisis

In this YouTube video, Didier Sornette explains his theory of "dragon-kings," which are extreme and rare events that result from trenchant dependences and slow maturation toward instability in financial markets. These events often go unnoticed by standard risk management tools but can be predictable and controllable with proper analysis. Sornette argues that the cause of financial crises lies in the inner instability of the system and that minor perturbations can trigger a crash. He suggests using ex ante analysis to predict these crises and developed the Financial Bubble Experiment to monitor and authenticate market predictions. Sornette believes that studying nonlinear transitions can help to develop advanced diagnostics of crises to prevent future devastating economic events.

In this section, Didier Sornette, founder of the Financial Crisis Observatory, explains the theory of “dragon-kings” and their potential impact on financial markets. Dragon-kings represent extreme and rare events that are outliers from the normal distribution of peak-to-valley financial fluctuations. These events are due to trenchant dependences and slow maturation towards instability, which result in the bubble phase and eventual crash. Dragon-kings are often missed by standard risk management tools and are predictable and controllable given proper analysis. The cause of the crisis lies in the inner instability of the system, and any minor perturbation can trigger the eventual crash.

In this section, speaker Didier Sornette argues that most extreme events, like financial crises, are knowable and predictable. He introduces the idea of the dragon-king, which exists in the context of super-exponential growth with positive feedback. Sornette explains that positive feedbacks can enhance previous growth and push forward the next growth through this kind of super-exponential growth which is not sustainable. He goes on to say that the mathematical solution of this class of models exhibit finite-time singularities which means that there is a critical time where the system will break, will change regime. The application of this theory to finance is seen in the long-standing history of bubbles which started in 1980, with the global bubble crashing in 1987. Sornette believes that quantitative easing and austerity measures are just a band-aid solution to the problem and the real issue needs to be addressed.

In this section, Didier Sornette discusses the idea of predicting financial crises before they happen by using ex ante analysis. He talks about the success he and his team have had in predicting major market bubbles, such as the Chinese stock market bubble, before they burst. Despite warnings, many hedge fund managers ignored the predictions, resulting in significant losses for those who did not take action. To counter the problem of self-fulfilling prophesies, Sornette and his team developed the Financial Bubble Experiment, where they secretly monitor the market, publish the predictions after the fact, and authenticate them. Sornette ends the section by teasing a recent prediction they made about the U.S. stock market in 2013, which has since started to change course.

In this section, Didier Sornette discusses the possibility of predicting financial crises through studying nonlinear transitions. He believes that despite the excitement of chasing bubbles and predicting crises, it is the responsibility of mankind to plan and predict crises, which is often a difficult task. The dragon-king theory gives hope in this regard, as it provides pockets of predictability, which can be used to develop advanced diagnostics of crises and prepare societies for them in the future, thus preventing devastating crises like the Great Recession and the European crisis.
