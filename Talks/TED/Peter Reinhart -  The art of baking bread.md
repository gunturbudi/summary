# Summary of Peter Reinhart: The art of baking bread

Peter Reinhart, a renowned artisan bread baker, shares his new technique called the epoxy method which involves making pre-doughs that bring out the full potential of flavor trapped in the grain, and hopes to create a bread that will taste as good as white bread. He explains the various stages of transforming wheat into bread, the fermentation process, shaping, proofing, and the transformations that occur in the oven. Reinhart seeks to answer the question, "What is it about bread that's so special?" He introduces "spent grain bread" which adds spent grains used for making beer to the bread, and he emphasizes the importance of enjoying the end result and sharing a homemade loaf with others.

In this section, Peter Reinhart, a renowned artisan bread baker, talks about his new technique for making whole-grain bread taste just as good as white bread. He calls it the epoxy method, which involves gathering all the knowledge of the artisan bread-baking community over the past two decades and putting it together to create a method that can bring out the full potential of flavor trapped in the grain. The method involves making two types of pre-doughs, one that starts enzyme activity and the other that starts to develop flavor. On day two, the two pieces are put together to create a powerful adhesive, similar to how epoxy works. The challenge for whole-grain bread is to make it taste good, which is where the method comes in. Through this method, Reinhart hopes to create a bread that will evoke the full potential of flavor trapped in the grain.

In this section, Peter Reinhart explains the various stages of transforming wheat into bread. He discusses the fermentation process that makes bread so special, the stages of shaping and proofing, and the transformations that occur in the oven. He emphasizes that bread is a transformational food that undergoes a radical change from the time wheat is harvested and turned into flour to when the bread is finally ready to eat. Through literal, metaphoric, political, and mystical connections, Reinhart seeks to answer the question, "What is it about bread that's so special?"

In this section, Peter Reinhart explains the process of making bread and all the transformations that take place during the process. The baker is like a God to the dough, nurturing and shaping it all along the way. The bread goes through multiple stages where the yeast helps to raise the dough while developing its personality and character with enzymes breaking down sugar, yeast eating sugar to turn it into alcohol and carbon dioxide, and bacteria eating sugar to turn it into acids. The baker's choices for ingredients, time, and temperature determine the outcome of the bread. Ultimately, the journey ends in the oven where the yeast gives up its life to produce the "staff of life" - bread, which is deeply embedded in our psyche and is used as a symbol for life and transformation. Finally, Peter Reinhart introduces "spent grain bread", which evokes more flavor from the grain by adding spent grains used for making beer to the bread.
