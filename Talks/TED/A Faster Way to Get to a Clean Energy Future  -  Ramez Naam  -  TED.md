# Summary of A Faster Way to Get to a Clean Energy Future | Ramez Naam | TED

Ramez Naam discusses the rapidly declining costs of various clean energy technologies, such as solar, wind, batteries, and power-to-fuels. Clean energy is cost-competitive in many parts of the world, and the efficient transmission of power through high-voltage lines can facilitate the transition to renewable energy. However, the reluctance of communities to allow the installation of wind power and the need to build transmission lines are barriers to this transition. Naam emphasizes the need for policymakers and governments to make permitting easier and allow for the building of clean energy infrastructure. Naam urges people to get out of the way of progress and embrace a more sustainable energy system.

In this section, the speaker discusses the rapidly declining cost of clean energy technology, citing solar as an example. He explains that in 1975, a solar panel cost $100 per watt of power, but by 2020, it had dropped to just 20 cents per watt of power, a 500-fold decline. This trend is not limited to solar, it applies to a wide variety of clean energy technologies, including wind, batteries, and even the cost of using clean electricity to produce hydrogen and other fuels is dropping exponentially. However, the speaker acknowledges that this decline is not happening fast enough to stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

In this section, the speaker discusses the exponential drop in the cost of solar, wind, batteries, and power-to-fuels, resulting in clean energy being cost-competitive in many parts of the world, where it is cheaper to build renewable energy than to put fuel into an already operating coal or gas plant. Despite the progress in the production of clean energy, there are still barriers impeding the transition to renewable energy. Examples include barriers to building and permits required, and obstacles such as usage of land for agriculture, reluctance to build in my backyard, the reluctance of communities to allow the installation of wind power, and reluctance to build transmission lines. To achieve a more reliable and consistent grid that prioritizes cleaner electricity, the attitude towards the construction of power plants and the grid must change to accommodate the transition.

In this section, Ramez Naam discusses the benefits of high-voltage power lines in transmitting power from where the sun and wind are to the coasts where energy demand is high with minimal loss. The efficient Ürümqi to Shanghai line is cited as an example, while it would be possible to transmit electricity from Seville to Copenhagen or bring power from the Great Plains to the coasts in winter. Two factors, permitting and grid build-out, are identified as powerful issues, backed up by the case of Texas where open competition on cost and easy permitting for electricity transmission have resulted in the state deploying the most solar and wind power. The importance of accelerating the pace of building transmission and making it easier to build, even if it means making it a bit easier to build some fossil infrastructure, is emphasized as clean energy will dominate the future with confidence in its economic competitiveness over fossil fuels.

In this final section, Ramez Naam emphasizes the need for policymakers and governments to make permitting easier and allow for clean energy infrastructure to be built. He stresses that with the advancements in technology and decreasing costs, it is time for us to act and build towards a cleaner future. Naam's message is clear: it's time to get out of the way of progress and embrace a more sustainable energy system.
