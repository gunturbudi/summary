# Summary of Can we solve global warming? Lessons from how we protected the ozone layer | Sean Davis

To be effective, the protocol requires a village, which we are starting to see with all the different groups that are working on climate change solutions.

The Paris Climate Accord is a product of the recognition that climate change is a global problem, and the Montreal Protocol is a successful example of how to protect the ozone layer.

In the 1970s, scientists discovered that CFCs were destroying the ozone layer, and the crisis helped spur nations to act to ban the use of CFCs. Today, the ozone layer is still being damaged by climate change, and we need to find new ways to protect it.

The Montreal Protocol is a successful example of how to solve global warming using risk management and decision making. The protocol was signed by President Reagan after unanimous ratification by the US Senate. The protocol has delayed global warming by more than a decade and is helping to heal the ozone layer. The protocol requires a village to be effective, and we are seeing encouraging signs of this with environmental groups, civic and religious groups, businesses, and the military all being involved in climate change solutions. Finally, don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good and continue working towards solutions that will avoid a future of catastrophic changes to the environment and human well-being.
