Through the Staff is a national nonprofit that provides free virtual private lessons to aspiring musicians from all over the country. Founder Matthew Garcia's idea for the nonprofit was inspired by his experience as a prize-winning violinist at the New England Conservatory. Garcia's idea for Through the Staff was to connect aspiring musicians from all over the country and help them to achieve their dreams. Through the Staff has provided almost 600,000 dollars of free virtual private lessons to almost 1000 young musicians from Fresno, California to Wilkesboro, North Carolina. Garcia's experience as a founder has shown him that virtual nonprofits can help to distribute educational resources to those who would benefit from them the most, even in fields traditionally inaccessible to people. Garcia is excited to see the future of the music and academic research industries, where more and more children are connected to the opportunities and knowledge they need to chase their dreams.
