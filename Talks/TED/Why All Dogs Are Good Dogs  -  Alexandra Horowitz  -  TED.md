# Summary of Why All Dogs Are Good Dogs | Alexandra Horowitz | TED

In this TED Talk, Alexandra Horowitz explores the world of dogs and highlights how their behavior is often misunderstood. She suggests that what is perceived as misbehavior is actually communication, and dogs have different preferences and needs, just like humans. Horowitz also emphasizes the importance of socializing dogs and how training should continue beyond their first year of life. She advises against using electronic collars, as they teach dogs to expect random punishment. Additionally, Horowitz explains that dogs see and smell differently than humans, and suggests taking dogs for "smell walks" to allow them to experience their unique perceptual world.

In this section, the speaker explains how dog misbehavior isn't really misbehavior but instead is a form of communication. They're trying to tell you something about their environment, emotions, or needs. Additionally, the reason behind their behavior is often due to a lack of comprehension of human behavior and a poorly designed environment made by their owners. Understanding these concepts leads to better communication and a greater appreciation for the dog's unique worldview.

In this section, Alexandra Horowitz talks about how studying dogs has changed the way she perceived her own dog, encouraging viewers to see their dogs in a different light by analyzing their behavior based on evolutionary history. She explains that a dog's misbehavior is a chance for us to better understand these creatures, to appreciate how their ancestral history continues to shape their behavior. Horowitz also talks about how dog owners tend to misunderstand their dog's behavior, especially when they see dogs that are cooperative with other humans. She attributes this to the steep learning curve involved in this kind of animal-human interaction. Finally, Horowitz draws parallels between raising a dog and raising a child, highlighting how they both require patience, understanding, and empathy.

In this section, Alexandra Horowitz talks about how we structure a dog's life in a human way and expect them to learn it instantly, while we give our children years to learn how to be cooperative. She suggests that when we have multiple dogs, it's important to remember that each dog is an individual and has their own preferences and needs, just like human beings. Alexandra also mentions that dogs have the capacity to learn words and understand to some extent, but they don't understand everything we say. Additionally, she discusses how the button apparatuses for dogs may not extend their communication ability but put into a language we understand something that the dog is already showing in some other way.

In this section, Alexandra Horowitz discusses how communication between humans and dogs already exists even without the help of technologies such as electronic collars. She explains that dogs are highly skilled communicators and understand a lot of what humans talk about, but not in a linguistic way, which is essential for humans. On the matter of training a dog, Horowitz explains that training starts when one socializes the dog to other dogs, people, and different types of noises and surprising things. She adds that training becomes successful when one exposes dogs to lots of different sounds and people during the socialization period between four to nine weeks of their life. Finally, Horowitz argues that electronic collars teach dogs that they will be randomly punished, and as a means of learning, it is a very poor device that can be detrimental.

In this section, Alexandra Horowitz talks about the importance of socializing dogs and how it should continue beyond their first year of life. Dogs, like humans, continue to learn new things and can learn up until the end of their lives. Horowitz explains that the adolescent brain of a dog is still developing so training and exposure to new environments might take longer compared to when they were puppies. She also touches on how misconceptions about misbehavior or a lack of understanding about why dogs behave the way they do can lead to dogs being returned to shelters. Lastly, Horowitz answers a question about whether dogs can see color, stating that they do have some color vision, although not as many hues as humans.

In this section, Alexandra Horowitz explains that dogs see differently than humans do because their eyes are much more adapted to seeing quick, low light, and night motion more than the human eyes. The dogs also smell their owner's breath because their breath carries a lot of information, such as evidence of their health status. Dogs eat their own or other dogs' feces for various reasons, including missing nutrients in their diet, wanting to hide their odor, or fear of punishment. Horowitz suggests pet owners take their dogs for smell walks to give them a chance to live in a parallel perceptual world, which can make them happier.
