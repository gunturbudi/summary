# Summary of Math is the hidden secret to understanding the world | Roger Antonsen

Roger Antonsen argues that in order to understand something deeply, we must be able to see it from different perspectives. He provides several examples of how mathematics and computer science can help us achieve this, and concludes by saying that empathy is also essential for understanding.

Roger Antonsen discusses the nature of understanding, which he claims revolves around the ability to see patterns and make assumptions. He goes on to demonstrate this by discussing the mathematics of tie knots and tap dancing.

Roger Antonsen demonstrates how mathematics can be used to understand the world by showing how equations are metaphors that represent two different perspectives. He then demonstrates how sound can be amplified or diminished depending on how it is multiplied by different numbers. Finally, he explains how the octave and fifth are two notes in an octave that are created when two sounds are played together.

Roger Antonsen argues that understanding something is possible if we can view it from different perspectives. He provides an example of understanding a letter R by seeing it in different contexts, and then demonstrates the same idea with other objects, such as the octahedron, the square pyramid, and the bicycle pump. He concludes by advocating for using different perspectives in mathematics and computer science, saying that they are essential for creating understanding.

Roger Antonsen explains that understanding something deeply requires the ability to change one's perspective, and that this can be achieved through studying mathematics and computer science. He also compares these disciplines to art forms, and concludes that understanding something deeply requires empathy.
