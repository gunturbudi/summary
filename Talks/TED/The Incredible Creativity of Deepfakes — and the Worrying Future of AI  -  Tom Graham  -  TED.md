# Summary of The Incredible Creativity of Deepfakes â€” and the Worrying Future of AI | Tom Graham | TED

Tom Graham, co-founder of Metaphysic, showcases the company's deepfake technology, which can create artificially generated content using real-world data to train neural nets. The company can even perform deepfakes in real-time, pushing the limits of AI technology and bringing us closer to a future where anyone can be the main character in their content on the internet. However, Graham express concerns about its potential downside, such as video manipulation and pornography, and its impact on individuals who may struggle to distinguish between what is real and computer-generated content. Despite this, deepfake technology can also have several benefits, including the ability to create compelling content, fostering cultural exchanges, and changing the way education is delivered. Graham proposes individuals should own property rights over the data and the photorealistic avatars to control their usage.

In this section, Tom Graham, co-founder of Metaphysic, showcases the company's deepfake technology, which specializes in creating artificially generated content that looks like reality, using real-world data to train neural nets. Graham plays a deepfake of Tom Cruise welcoming the audience to the TED conference. He also demonstrates that Metaphysic's technology is not restricted to faces, sharing an example where a person's singing voice is transported across to another person's face. Graham confirms that the company can also perform deepfakes in real-time, pushing the limits of AI technology and bringing us to the brink of a future where anyone can be the main character in their content on the internet.

In this section, the speaker discusses the downside of deepfake technology, such as the potential for video manipulation and pornography, and expresses concern about its impact on individuals who may struggle to distinguish between what is real and computer-generated content. Although shutting down a single company wouldn't stop this problem, raising public awareness of manipulated media can be valuable. Despite this, there are multiple benefits to the technology, including the ability to create compelling content, fostering emotional connections and cultural exchanges, and changing the way education is delivered. The speaker describes how a single teacher could extend their instruction to thousands of classrooms worldwide, and students could interact globally beyond standard video conferencing.

In this section, Tom Graham discusses the potential of creating hyper-realistic media that allows individuals to relive experiences with loved ones who may have passed away. However, he raises the concern of controlling the use of these realistic avatars and who owns the data used to train the algorithms. As a solution, Graham proposes that individuals should own property rights over the data and the photorealistic avatars to control their usage. He had submitted a video of his AI-version to the US Copyright Office to register for copyright, establishing that people should have the right to take down unauthorized videos of themselves.
