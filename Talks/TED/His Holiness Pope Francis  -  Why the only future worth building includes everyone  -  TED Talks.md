In this section, Pope Francis discusses the power of hope and how it is not just an optimistic outlook on life, but a virtue that resides deep within our hearts. Hope can begin with just one person, and as it grows, it can spark a revolution of tenderness that sees people using their eyes, ears, and hands to comfort others and take care of those in need. Tenderness is the language of children, and it is a reminder that we are never truly alone, as God himself came down to be on our level.

In this section, Pope Francis emphasizes the importance of tenderness and humility in wielding power, stating that tenderness is not a weakness but rather a path of solidarity and fortitude. He notes that the more powerful one is, the more responsible they are to act humbly, as power without humility and tenderness will ruin both the wielder and others. He believes that while politicians, leaders, and big companies hold immense responsibility, the future of humankind lies in the hands of those who recognize others as part of an "us" and understand that everyone needs each other. Pope Francis asks for tenderness toward himself so that he can fulfill his task for the good of all.
