In this section, Matthieu Ricard discusses the possibility of changing our negative emotions and habits into positive ones through mind training, which is based on the idea that two opposite mental factors cannot occur simultaneously. By understanding the nature of our consciousness and practicing specific antidotes to destructive emotions, we can transform our minds and develop a new way of being that is more in line with reality and interdependence. It may take time, but the process of familiarization with a new way of perceiving things is what leads to mind transformation, which is the very essence of meditation.
