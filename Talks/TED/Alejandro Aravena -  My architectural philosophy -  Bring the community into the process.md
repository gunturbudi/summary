# Summary of Alejandro Aravena: My architectural philosophy? Bring the community into the process

In the video "Alejandro Aravena: My architectural philosophy? Bring the community into the process," Aravena discusses his belief in participatory design and the importance of bringing the community into the architectural process, particularly when addressing issues of urbanization and housing for low-income populations. He presents three case studies to illustrate his philosophy, including a housing project for 100 families living under the poverty line in Iquique, Chile, a solution for the city of Constitución after a tsunami hit in 2010, and the creation of a forest in a previously barren area with the help of community involvement. Aravena emphasizes the role of design in shaping and modeling life itself, rather than just focusing on physical materials.

In this section, Alejandro Aravena discusses the challenge of urbanization and the need to accommodate an increasing population in cities, many of whom are living under the poverty line. He offers a case study from the city of Iquique, Chile where his firm was asked to accommodate 100 families using a $10,000 subsidy that included land purchase, infrastructure development, and building homes. Through a participatory design process with the families, Aravena's firm developed a solution that involved building vertically and innovatively designing a building/house hybrid that was affordable, expandable, and could pay for expensive, well-located land. The design was created with the belief that public funding should do the half that families weren't able to do individually, and the process allowed families to join forces and split tasks.

In this section, Alejandro Aravena discusses three cases that demonstrate his architectural philosophy. First, he believes that providing the frame for housing units and letting families take over can help solve the "3S" menace of scale, speed, and scarcity, and ultimately lead to sustainable housing. Second, he explains how design can contribute to sustainability, by providing the right environment for knowledge creation, with hollowed cores and outdoor spaces. Lastly, he speaks about how design can provide comprehensive answers against natural disasters, by working on the reconstruction of the Constitución after an earthquake and tsunami hit Chile in 2010.

In this section, Alejandro Aravena describes the process of creating a solution for the city of Constitución, which was hit by a large tsunami in 2010. After exploring two options which were either unrealistic or irresponsible, his team decided to engage in participatory design to involve the community in finding a solution. Through this process, it was discovered that flooding was a more immediate and pressing problem for the community than a future tsunami. The team proposed creating a forest that would dissipate the force of nature and provide democratic access to the river, which was validated politically and socially but was thought to cost 48 million dollars until a survey discovered that three ministries had plans for the same place totaling 52 million dollars.

In this section, Alejandro Aravena emphasizes the importance of translating the forces of self-construction, common sense, and nature into architectural form. He states that the true purpose of design is to put the force of life at the heart of architecture, rather than just focusing on the physical materials like cement, bricks, or wood. Aravena's goal is to model and shape life itself through his designs, which is exemplified in his work constructing a forest in a previously barren area with the help of community involvement.
