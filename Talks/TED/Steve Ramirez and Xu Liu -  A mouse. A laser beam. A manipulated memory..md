# Summary of Steve Ramirez and Xu Liu: A mouse. A laser beam. A manipulated memory.

Neuroscientists Steve Ramirez and Xu Liu have developed a switch, carried by an engineered virus, that can activate cells in the hippocampus using light without drugs. Using optogenetics, they placed a light-sensitive switch, channelrhodopsin, into cells to turn them on or off using a laser. They tested this by creating a fear memory in mice in a completely new environment that they could recreate using lasers. Ramirez and Liu introduced Project Inception, which explores editing memories by reactivating them and presenting new information to change the memory's association in the brain. The scientists emphasized the importance of the ethical and societal implications of memory manipulation, urging further conversations on the topic.

In this section, neuroscientist Steve Ramirez discusses the idea of going into the brain to edit out negative feelings associated with a specific memory while still retaining the memory itself. He and fellow neuroscientist Xu Liu found that the hippocampus is an ideal target to try and reactivate a memory. They developed a switch that can activate cells and packed it into an engineered virus that is injected into the mouse brain. The switch needs to act quickly in milliseconds without drugs to control a memory in real-time.

In this section of the video, Steve Ramirez and Xu Liu discuss how they could activate or inactive memories by only using light. This led them to use optogenetics, a technique that allowed them to put a light-sensitive switch called channelrhodopsin into cells to be able to turn them on or off using a laser. To test if the system worked, they placed mice who formed a fear memory in a box that resulted in freezing behavior. They were able to recreate this same memory in mice in a completely new environment using lasers.

In this section, the scientists discuss the various reactions they've received from the public, ranging from excitement about the technology's potential to fear of potential misuse. They also introduce a new project they've been working on, called Project Inception, in which they explore the idea of editing memories by reactivating them and presenting new information to change the association of the memory in the brain. The scientists explain the light-controlled "on" and "off" switches they have created, which can activate or erase memories on cue. They also mention other groups working on similar memory manipulation techniques, and express their belief in the exciting possibilities of memory manipulation to create new, positive experiences and erase unwanted ones.

In this final section of the presentation, the speakers emphasize the importance of engaging everyone in the conversation about the ethical and societal implications of memory manipulation. They urge the audience to consider what this technology means and where society should go from here, as important decisions need to be made.
