# Summary of The Rise of the "Trauma Essay" in College Applications | Tina Yong | TED

In "The Rise of the 'Trauma Essay' in College Applications", Tina Yong discusses the harmful phenomenon of high school students feeling pressure to share their deepest traumas in their college applications in hopes of standing out to admissions counselors. This approach risks reinforcing existing inequities in higher education and doesn't actually help applicants process their trauma. Yong suggests that universities be more transparent about admissions guidelines and restructure prompts to focus on students' goals for the future and academic interests, while also encouraging applicants to remember that they are more than their trauma and find their own voice to tell their story.

In this section, the video discusses the phenomenon of high school students feeling pressure to write about their deepest traumas in their college applications, with the hope that their story will seem resilient and interesting enough to get them a spot. College admissions counselors play a huge role in this phenomenon by advising students to "get personal" and share painful memories that have helped them become resilient individuals. However, this approach to evaluating applicants is harmful, as it risks reinforcing existing inequities in higher education and doesn't actually help applicants process their trauma. Writing about a difficult experience is often an anguishing and stressful process, and applicants need to be given the space to share their stories on their own terms and not feel like their worthiness is tied to their ability to endure pain.

In this section, the speaker discusses how the trauma essay in college applications places an immense burden on young applicants to reveal their deepest personal struggles to strangers who hold their academic future in their hands. The essay also assumes that every difficult experience is a learning opportunity to be turned into progress, ignoring valid feelings of resentment and anger that many victims still feel. The trauma essay creates a fundamental contradiction where the writer must be vulnerable but cannot be too vulnerable, leaving no room for the unfiltered truth. While universities are not directly responsible for pushing students to reveal their trauma, their failure to clear up speculations about whether trauma essays are rewarded or discouraged is indirectly enabling the harmful implications of the trauma essay.

In this section, the speaker suggests that universities could take steps to improve the college application process when it comes to writing about traumatic personal experiences. She recommends that universities be more transparent about their admissions guidelines and restructure their prompts to focus on students' goals for the future and academic interests. Admissions counselors should be trained in working with BIPOC individuals and should not pressure students to write about traumatic experiences. Finally, she encourages applicants to remember that they are more than the bad things that happened to them and to find their own voice to tell their story.
