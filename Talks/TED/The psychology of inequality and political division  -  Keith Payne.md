# Summary of The psychology of inequality and political division | Keith Payne

Keith Payne discusses the psychological reasons behind the link between economic inequality and political polarization, explaining that people constantly compare themselves to others and experience pain if they are at the bottom, leading to the "better-than-average effect." Payne's experiment showed that those who felt richer believed in cutting taxes on the wealthy, while the group that felt poorer believed the system was rigged. Feeling deprived compared to others brings shame and disengagement from the system, while feeling better than others leads people to protect their position. The speaker encourages recognizing tailwinds that helped us succeed, finding common ground, and taking action to interrupt the cycle of inequality.

In this section, Keith Payne discusses how economic inequality can lead to political polarization and division. He explains that people constantly compare themselves to others and want to come out on top, experiencing pain if they are at the bottom. This leads to the "better-than-average effect," where people believe they are better than average at things they care about. Payne and his team conducted an experiment where they divided participants into two groups, one made to feel richer and the other poorer for no objective reason, and found that those who felt richer believed in cutting taxes on the wealthy and cutting benefits to the poor, while the group that felt poorer believed that the system was rigged. Payne argues that the link between inequality and political division is due to psychological reasons and that people can improve both simultaneously by understanding these reasons.

In this section, the speaker shares the consequences of feeling deprived compared to others - it brings shame and makes people turn away from the system, instead of motivating them to take action against it. On the other hand, feeling better than other people is motivating and leads people to protect their position. Furthermore, those who feel entitled to dismiss those who disagree with them are mostly the well-off. As inequality grows, political interest and participation among the poor decrease, and people turn away and drop out. To fix our politics and address extreme inequality, the best place to start is with those who have benefited the most from its rise. Interrupting the cycle of inequality is possible, and it is necessary to take action to do so.

In this section of the video, the speaker discusses the "headwind-tailwind asymmetry" and how it relates to psychology of inequality and political division. When struggling against obstacles, all you can see are the headwinds, making it harder to recognize the tailwinds that helped you succeed. The speaker challenges the audience to recognize their own tailwinds and lucky breaks and to think about how a different position may affect their perspective. He encourages finding common ground and recognizing that disagreeing with someone does not make them an idiot, as real change must come from the well-off who hold the responsibility of enacting change.
