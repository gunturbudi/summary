# Summary of A walk through the stages of sleep | Sleeping with Science, a TED series

This video explains the different stages of sleep, which consist of non-REM and REM sleep, in a 90-minute cycle. The ratio of the two types of sleep changes throughout the night, with potential consequences for physical and emotional health if sleep is lost unevenly across the different stages.

In this section, the video explores the two main types of sleep â€“ non-REM and REM, which play out in a battle for brain domination throughout the night. The standard cycling architecture of human sleep takes place in a 90-minute cycle, but the ratio of non-REM to REM sleep in these cycles changes as we move across the night. This structure is important because, as we learn, the lost sleep may not be distributed evenly throughout the stages of sleep, leading to some potential consequences for our physical and emotional health.
