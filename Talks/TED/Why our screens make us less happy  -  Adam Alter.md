# Summary of Why our screens make us less happy | Adam Alter

In his talk, "Why our screens make us less happy," Adam Alter discusses how screens are taking up an increasing amount of personal time and causing people to spend less time on activities that enrich their lives. While screens have their benefits, apps associated with dating, social networking, gaming, entertainment, news, and web browsing are taking up three times as much time as apps associated with relaxation, exercise, weather, reading, education, and health, but only half of the people who use them feel good about it. The absence of stopping cues in today's media consumption makes it easy to continue scrolling for an indefinite amount of time. Alter emphasizes creating personal stopping cues to reduce the use of smart devices and focus on meaningful experiences, leading to a richer and more fulfilling life.

In this section, the speaker discusses "dogfooding" as a common business tactic where businesspeople use their own products to demonstrate their confidence in them. However, the screen-based tech industry appears to be an exception to this practice, with Steve Jobs limiting the amount of technology his own children use at home. Screens are taking up a considerable amount of our personal time, as shown through data collected over the years. The speaker highlights that while screens have their benefits, they are also causing people to spend increasingly less time on activities that make them individuals and enrich their lives. Apps associated with relaxation, exercise, weather, reading, education, and health make people happy. In contrast, apps that focus on dating, social networking, gaming, entertainment, news, and web browsing are taking up three times as much time as the former, but only half of the people who use them feel good about it.

In this section, the speaker talks about the concept of stopping cues and how they are lacking in today's media consumption. With the absence of stopping cues, it is easier for people to continue scrolling through social media, email, or news feeds for an indefinite amount of time. The speaker offers some ideas from other countries that can help to deal with the lack of stopping cues, such as the idea of stopping work by having the desk lifted to the ceiling and having emails deleted during vacations or making a personal rule never to use the phone during dinner. By creating personal stopping cues, one can reduce the use of smart devices and focus more on meaningful experiences, leading to a richer and more fulfilling life.
