# Summary of James Watson: How we discovered DNA

In this video, James Watson discusses the discovery of DNA and how it has led to a better understanding of human genetics. Watson believes that the discovery of DNA has the potential to help prevent mental disorders such as schizophrenia, and he expresses his gratitude to those who were involved in the research.

In the 1950s, James Watson and Francis Crick discovered the structure of DNA. Watson says that he was interested in genetics from the time he heard of Charles Darwin, and he applied to Caltech only to be rejected. He then went to Indiana and found that the field was more interesting than he ever could have imagined. Watson's doctoral thesis was on the structure of DNA and he credits Maurice Wilkins with inspiring him to pursue genetics.

James Watson and Francis Crick worked together to create a model for DNA that was based on x-ray photographs. Watson, who was 23 at the time, said that he was "scared" that they would be "scooped" by someone at Caltech, and so Bragg told them to build models. Watson and Crick built models, while Rosalind Franklin, who was not a chemist, later helped them with the model.

James Watson and Francis Crick discovered the structure of DNA in 1953, which helped them to understand how genetic information is carried and how proteins are made. Despite this success, Watson was unhappy with the lack of recognition his team received during their research. In 1960, they found out that DNA provides the instructions for making RNA, and in 1966, they discovered the third form of RNA. Marshall Nirenberg was the first to use synthetic RNA to create protein.

James Watson, one of the co-discoverers of DNA, discusses the genetic origins of various diseases. He talks about the technology used to study DNA and the first diseases studied using this technology, autism and schizophrenia. Watson also mentions that left-handed people are more likely to develop schizophrenia, and that the genetics of schizophrenia are still largely unknown.
