The theater matters because it is the essential art form of democracy; theater was born in the same city as democracy, in 6th century BC. The thesis of democracy is that the conflict of different points of view leads to the truth. Oskar Eustis explains that theater is also essential for democracy because it allows people to experience empathy for each other, and it creates a community of people who come to watch theater together. Joe Papp created Free Shakespeare in the Park, which is an event where the best theater is given to everyone free of charge.
