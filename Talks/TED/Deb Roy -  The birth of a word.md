# Summary of Deb Roy: The birth of a word

Deb Roy discusses the research that has been done into how words are learned and how certain words are born earlier than others. The study found that caregiver speech becomes simpler and then gradually ramps up in complexity as the child learns new words. This phenomenon corresponds with when each word is born and is a result of the child learning from their linguistic environment as well as from other people in their life.

Deb Roy's family recorded their life through a home video recording system for five and a half years, accumulating over a quarter-million hours of data. Roy used motion analysis to track the movements of his son, and found that the child gradually learned to produce the correct adult form of words, starting with 'gaga' and progressing to 'water.'

Deb Roy's team uses data to study how language and content are connected. They use TV content as an example, looking at how comments and content are related. This allows them to probe the structure of social media networks and content.

This talk by Deb Roy covers the origins of words and how they are used in social media. Roy discusses how a piece of content (e.g. a speech by President Obama), the context in which it is said (e.g. in a hallway), and the conversation around it (e.g. on social media) all contribute to its success. Roy also shares a memorable moment from his own family.
