# Summary of A powerful way to unleash your natural creativity | Tim Harford

Tim Harford discusses the concept of slow-motion multitasking, where creative individuals work on multiple projects simultaneously by operating between them as required. He explains that this type of multitasking can be useful in producing innovative concepts and cites research that shows the most successful and enduringly creative scientists changed the subject matter numerous times during their first hundred published research papers. Harford presents three ways in which multitasking can work for creativity: letting your mind wander, cross-training your mind in two separate fields and having another exciting and challenging project to work on when stuck. He suggests using the box method to safely store creative inspiration for each project as a reminder and to avoid misplacing important ideas. Finally, Harford highlights Charles Darwin's multitasking abilities and suggests making a list of projects, avoiding distractions, and focusing on a few things at a time.

In this section, Tim Harford presents the concept of "slow-motion multitasking," which involves having multiple projects on the go simultaneously and operating between them as required. Harford argues that this type of multitasking is not only normal but a common trait among highly creative individuals. He discusses Bernice Eiduson's research, which found that the most successful and enduringly creative scientists changed the subject matter numerous times during their first hundred published research papers. These findings show that moving backward and forwards between topics or ideas in slow-motion multitasking can be useful in producing innovative concepts.

In this section, the speaker explains that multitasking can work for creativity in three different ways. The first is by letting your mind wander and connecting two unrelated ideas to solve a difficult problem. The second is by cross-training your mind in two separate fields, like art and medicine, to improve your skills in one of them. The third is by having another exciting and challenging project to work on when you're stuck on the first one. For instance, Einstein turned to an easier problem on the stimulated emission of radiation before moving back to general relativity and finding a groundbreaking idea. Therefore, slow-motion multitasking can be a powerful way to organize our creative lives and improve problem-solving abilities.

In this section, Tim Harford shares a simple solution to prevent overwhelming creative projects. Borrowing from choreographer Twyla Tharp, Harford suggests giving each project a labeled cardboard box or digital equivalent, where creative inspiration such as books or program cuttings can be safely stored. The box method serves as a reminder to creative individuals, sparing them from the worst case scenario of misplacing or forgetting their next brilliant idea. Harford also highlights Charles Darwinâ€™s slow-burning multitasking abilities in continuing his interests across various fields, resulting in the discovery of species evolution.

In this section, the speaker talks about Charles Darwin's earthworm experiments as an example of how the great slow-motion multitaskers can help us unleash our natural creativity. Despite working on his book, "The Descent of Man," Darwin would unwind by studying earthworms intensely in his billiard room, conducting various experiments on them from playing the bassoon to shining lights on them. The speaker suggests that we can also make multitasking work for us by slowing it down, making a list of our projects and avoiding constant distractions like our phones, and focusing on a few things at a time, rather than trying to do everything at once.
