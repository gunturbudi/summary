# Summary of Why we make bad decisions | Dan Gilbert

In this video, Dan Gilbert highlights various reasons why people often make bad decisions. He talks about errors in estimating the odds of success and the value of success, which can lead to irrational decision-making. He also discusses the impact of memory, comparison, and shifting comparisons on decision-making. Gilbert believes that we need to become better at estimating odds and valuing our future pains over present pleasures to ensure our survival as a species, and suggests that understanding the psychological reaction to events is just as important as stopping the events themselves. Finally, he explains that buying lottery tickets can provide the anticipation leading up to the drawing to release serotonin in the brain, providing a better feeling than simply throwing the money away.

In this section, Dan Gilbert talks about Daniel Bernoulli's theory of decision-making, and how it involves the multiplication of the odds of gaining something with the value of that gain. He explains that people are bad at estimating these two things, making two types of errors when trying to decide on the right course of action: errors in estimating the odds of success and errors in estimating the value of their own success. He gives examples such as people spending more on gambling than on all other forms of entertainment combined in the US and how people use memory to estimate probabilities, which can lead them astray.

In this section, Dan Gilbert discusses how people tend to vastly overestimate the risk of things that are more memorable, such as tornadoes and fireworks, while underestimating things that are less memorable, such as drowning and asthma. People tend to underestimate their odds of winning in the lottery and overestimate the odds of someone else winning. Gilbert explains that people compare prices to what they have previously paid instead of asking what else they could do with the money, which is a systematic error that leads to irrationality.

In this section, Dan Gilbert talks about how people tend to compare their present experiences with their past, which can lead to bad decisions. He gives examples of how people prefer rising salaries and are more likely to buy a Hawaiian vacation package at a lower price than at a higher price, even if it is still a good deal. He also highlights the impact of comparison on the value of things and shows how it can affect our decision-making process. Finally, he shares an experiment from his lab, where the presence of chocolates or spam in a room influences people's perceived enjoyment of potato chips.

In this section, Dan Gilbert discusses how shifting comparisons can affect decision-making, using examples of buying a car stereo and speakers, as well as traveling and meeting new people. He also gives an example of how people struggle with making decisions about things that will happen at different points in time, as they tend to use two simple rules of preferring more and now being better than later, which can sometimes conflict. However, people can become more patient by changing when the delivery of monetary units will happen, as it removes the troubling comparison of waiting for an extra amount of time.

In this section, Dan Gilbert explains why people make bad decisions by using an optical illusion featuring two figures, a fireman and a fiddler. He explains that subjective value is related to the distance in time from the decision, and people will change their mind as they approach the future. Our brains were evolved for a very different world than the one in which we are living and the only thing that can destroy us is our own decisions. Gilbert believes that we need to become better at estimating odds and valuing our future pains over present pleasures to ensure our survival as a species. In response to a question about terrorism, Gilbert suggests that understanding the psychological reaction to events is just as important as stopping the atrocities themselves.

In this section of the video, Dan Gilbert discusses the issue of disproportionate responses to small-scale accidents, such as the excessive coverage of terror attacks by the media despite more people dying from not using seatbelts or the flu. Gilbert points out that our responses may be influenced by the drama of the event, the fact that itâ€™s an intentional attack by outsiders, and the media's need to sell news. He believes our distress about threats should be proportional to the scale of those threats, yet terrorism is given an out-sized response, partly due to the "mental bug" we have developed as a result of our evolutionary past.

In this section, the speaker counters the common idea that buying lottery tickets is a waste of money by pointing out that the anticipation leading up to the drawing actually releases serotonin in the brain, providing a better feeling than simply throwing the money away. While economists tend to view this behavior as irrational, the speaker argues that there is some utility to buying lottery tickets beyond just the possibility of winning. He goes on to suggest that in order to make better long-term decisions, people need to vividly imagine their futures rather than only considering the near term.
