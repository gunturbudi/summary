# Summary of Ron Eglash: The fractals at the heart of African designs

Ron Eglash discusses the fractals present in African designs, which are self-similar patterns at many different scales. He argues that the fractals are a conscious pattern used to map social scaling onto geometric scaling, and that they represent the ancestors and the village as a whole. He also discusses the potential applications of fractals in African design, including in postal addressing and architecture.

In 1877, Georg Cantor discovered that infinite sets exist, and in 1977, Benoit Mandelbrot observed that fractals, which are self-similar patterns at many different scales, appear in nature. In the 1980s, Ron Eglash noticed that fractals are present in African designs and traveled to Africa to ask the people who were creating them. He found that the fractals are a conscious pattern used to map social scaling onto geometric scaling. The fractals in African designs represent the ancestors and the village as a whole.

The fractals at the heart of African designs are self-similar, and often use algorithms and age-grade systems to create a wide variety of designs. This video interviews Ron Eglash, an architect who has studied African fractals and observed that they are similar but not identical to each other.

Ron Eglash is the founder of Fractal Fences, a company that specializes in designing fractal fences using fractals as a design principle. He explains that fractals are a practical way to create tight rows of straw that resist wind and dust, and that fractals are also found in Africa in various forms of divination. Eglash has recently been awarded a grant from the National Science Foundation to create a programmable version of fractal fences for use by anyone in the world. These tools have been found to be successful in teaching mathematics to children, and Eglash is currently piloting a program in Ghana.

Ron Eglash discusses the potential applications of fractals in African design, including in postal addressing and architecture. He argues that fractals are a valuable tool for self-organization and for developing egalitarian, gentle methods of entrepreneurship.
