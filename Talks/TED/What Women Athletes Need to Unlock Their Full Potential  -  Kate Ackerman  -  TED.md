In this section, Kate Ackerman shares her experiences as a former Olympic team member in rowing and how the lack of menstrual health and medical attention for female athletes led her to pursue a career in sports medicine. She talks about how the U.S. Olympic Committee refused to share information on female athlete health, prompting her to conduct her research, leading her to become overeducated and feel like she/she was overcompensating. Kate then launched a female athlete program in 2013 and assisted in organizing a biennial event, bringing together international speakers to collaborate and communicate the importance of better understanding female athlete health.

In this section, Kate Ackerman discusses the importance of supporting girls in sports and the need for more research focused on women. Despite the fact that sports boost physical and mental health and help propel girls into successful careers, the dropout rate for girls in sports is higher compared to boys. Additionally, only 6% of sport and exercise science journals between 2014 and 2020 focused solely on women. Ackerman's team is working on different research topics, such as sex and menstrual cycle effects on performance, relative energy deficiency in sport, pregnancy and postpartum, psychological resilience, injury prevention and recovery, and the effects of menopause. Ackerman and her team are trying to launch a vision and are asking for greater investment from sports companies, medical institutions, and other foundations to create a one-stop-shop where athletes can access all this research under one roof.
