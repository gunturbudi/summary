# Summary of Soon We'll Cure Diseases With a Cell, Not a Pill | Siddhartha Mukherjee | TED Talks

Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee proposes a new approach to medicine that focuses on the self-regulating cell as the key to treating noninfectious and chronic diseases. He describes the limitations of the current dominant model of taking a pill to kill something and proposes thinking about illness hierarchically upwards from cells to organs and ultimately the environment. The potential of skeletal stem cells for regenerative medicine is highlighted and the need for new mechanisms, models, and metaphors in the future of personalized medicine is emphasized. By incorporating genomics and moving towards multi-order, self-regulating systems, it is possible to truly personalize treatment.

In this section, the speaker discusses the past and present of medicine, where the dominant model is to take a pill to kill something to treat an illness. This model has worked well for infectious diseases, but for noninfectious and chronic diseases, only 0.025% of chemical reactions in the body can be targeted using this model. The speaker proposes a new approach by thinking about illness hierarchically upwards from a self-regulating cell, to organs, to humans, and ultimately the environment. This approach offers a new way of thinking about diseases like cancer, where current treatments try to kill the cancer cells, but a more effective approach may be to understand the cancer cells' behavior and communication with healthy cells.

In this section, the speaker explains how we have been using pills to cure diseases like leukemia and some forms of breast cancer with some limitations. Using the immune system to attack cancer has led to some of the most spectacular new cancer medicines. Attempts have also been made to change the hormonal and metabolic milieus to prevent cancer, change the physiology of the organ for depression and change the perception of medicine. The speaker shares a personal story of how he experimented with stem cells to fix his own degenerated knee and how dysfunction of skeletal stem cells can cause osteochondral arthritis in many people.

In this section of the video, Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee describes the discovery of skeletal stem cells, which have the ability to repair fractures and form bone and cartilage. He explains that these cells have four properties that make them promising in terms of regenerative medicine, but their numbers decline significantly as people age. This leads to a shift in thinking about medicine from pills to cells, organisms, and environments. Dr. Mukherjee raises intriguing questions about the future of medicine, such as whether a medicine could be an organ created outside the body or an environment, and how such models could be developed. He concludes with the idea that scientists need to create new models to think about medicine in the future, as antibiotics have colored our way of thinking about medicine for the last hundred years.

In this section, Siddhartha Mukherjee explains that the primary issue with medical treatment is not necessarily the lack of effective drugs, but rather that we need better mechanisms, models, and metaphors. Looking towards the future of personalized medicine, Mukherjee notes that the current approach of personalization focuses on genomics, but to achieve truly personalized care, cellular therapies must be individualized first. By incorporating genomics and moving towards multi-order, self-regulating systems like cells and organs, it is possible to truly personalize treatment.
