In this talk, William Ury argues that because humans are reaction machines, it is easy to lose perspective in conflicts and react inappropriately. The third side, which is represented by the balcony, helps us to go to a place of perspective where we can see the conflict from a different perspective. Ury tells the story of an incident where he facilitated negotiations between Russian and Chechen leaders and how the third side helped him stay in control. He argues that the story of Abraham, which is a third-side story, could be a tool to help fight terrorism.
