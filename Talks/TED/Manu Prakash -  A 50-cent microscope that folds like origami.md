# Summary of Manu Prakash: A 50-cent microscope that folds like origami

Manu Prakash has created a microscope called Foldscope, which is made entirely out of folded paper and is cheap and functional, capable of fluorescence, bright-field, polarization, and projection microscopy. The design is simple to use, communicating instructions via a color code found on the folded paper, and is rugged enough to withstand rough handling. The Foldscope aims to solve the scalability problem of disease diagnostics with traditional research microscopes, with a price of 50 cents per unit, and it can be used in the fields of education as well as global health.

In this section, Manu Prakash discusses the Foldscope, a microscope made entirely out of folded paper that is both cheap and functional. The Foldscope is capable of fluorescence, bright-field, polarization, and projection microscopy, and can be built using instructions communicated through a color code found on the paper. The Foldscope is designed to be simple to use by health workers around the world and is rugged enough to withstand rough handling. It aims to solve the problem of scalability of disease diagnostics caused by the impracticality and expense of traditional research microscopes.

In this section, Manu Prakash demonstrates the capabilities of the foldscope, including its ability to project and zoom in on microscopic images, as well as its durability in being waterproof and able to survive drops from high heights. He emphasizes the affordability of the foldscope which was built with 50 cents worth of parts and how it could revolutionize the field of microscopy with the concept of use-and-throw microscopy. Prakash also discusses the potential for the foldscope to be used as an educational tool for children in the realm of science education and global health.
