In this section, John Cary discusses the importance of diversifying the architecture and design industry to create more equitable and dignifying buildings, landscapes, and communities. He highlights that only 15 percent of registered architects in the United States are women, and an even smaller percentage are persons of color. Cary explains that if more diverse voices were involved in creating blueprints for shared built environments, they would be more beautiful, functional, equitable, and dignifying for everyone.
