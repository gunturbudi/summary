This video is about a Ghanaian man who was going through a lot of personal turmoil, including an anxiety attack. His doctor recommended he speak with a mental health professional, and he felt a profound sense of shame and felt the weight of stigma. He grew up in West Africa, and when people used the term "mental," what came to mind was a madman with dirty, dread-locked hair, bumbling around half-naked on the streets. He tells the story of his parents warning him about this man, and how we as Africans often respond to mental health with distance, ignorance, guilt, fear, and anger. In a study conducted by Arboleda-Fl√≥rez, 34 percent of Nigerian respondents cited drug misuse as the cause of mental illness.
