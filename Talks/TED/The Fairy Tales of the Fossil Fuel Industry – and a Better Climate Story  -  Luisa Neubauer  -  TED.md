# Summary of The Fairy Tales of the Fossil Fuel Industry â€“ and a Better Climate Story | Luisa Neubauer | TED

In her TED talk, Luisa Neubauer exposes the fairy tale perpetuated by the fossil fuel industry to justify its destructive practices, growing up believing that fossil fuels were necessary for economic growth until she learned about the climate crisis. She highlights the urgent need to limit global heating to 1.5 degrees and calls on the fossil fuel industry to stop expanding and lying about it, stop destroying livelihoods, and let people create rules informed by science. Neubauer urges everyone to start working towards building a new tomorrow that prioritizes people over profits, lives over fossil fuels, and justice and safety in the fight against the climate crisis.

In this section, Luisa Neubauer discusses how the fairy tale of fossil fuels has been perpetuated in Germany and around the world. Growing up, she believed that fossil fuels were necessary for economic growth, but as she learned more about the climate crisis, she realized that the fossil fuel industry is the driving force behind it. The industry has known for decades that their business practices would lead to a climate disaster, but rather than take action, they chose to tell fairy tales and mislead people. Now, as they present themselves as part of the solution, Neubauer explains that there is no time for delay, and any suggestion that more time is needed is a failure to understand the urgency of the crisis.

In this section, Luisa Neubauer highlights the simple equation behind the climate crisis that requires no new fossil fuel exploration to limit global heating to 1.5 degrees. Unfortunately, fossil fuel industries are expanding worldwide, with each ongoing mega-project emitting far more than one gigaton of CO2. Furthermore, fossil fuels are not only destroying our climate and livelihoods but empowering autocrats worldwide to wage wars and threaten democracies. Luisa proposes three messages to the fossil fuel industry, including the need to stop expanding fossil fuels and lying about it, to stop destroying livelihoods, especially in highly affected areas, and to let the people create rules informed by science. Finally, Luisa calls on everyone to start working towards building a new tomorrow, which will prioritize people over profits and lives over fossil fuels, and put a premium on justice and safety in the fight against the climate crisis.
