# Summary of Paul Zak: Trust, morality - and oxytocin

Paul Zak discusses his research on oxytocin and its link to morality, empathy, and trust. He found that higher levels of oxytocin were associated with greater trustworthiness and generosity, and that low oxytocin levels can lead to psychopathy or selfish behavior. Zak also talks about the different ways people connect emotionally, and how social media use can increase oxytocin levels. He suggests that something as simple as a hug can release oxytocin and lead to happier relationships, and that oxytocin can be delivered intranasally.

In this section, Paul Zak explains that humans are unique in having fully developed moral sentiments and how he became obsessed with the idea of finding a chemistry of morality. After conducting experiments, he found that oxytocin, a molecule found in mammals, could be the moral molecule, but it was difficult to measure its impact on morality due to its short half-life. To overcome this, Zak and his team measured the trustworthiness of participants by tempting them with money, showing them efficiency in giving and receiving of money. The results showed that higher oxytocin levels were associated with greater trustworthiness, which can help alleviate poverty in low trust countries.

In this section, Paul Zak discusses his experiments with oxytocin and trustworthiness. He found that the more money the second person received, the more oxytocin was produced in their brain, leading to more money being returned. Through further experiments with an oxytocin inhaler and controlling oxytocin levels in the brain, Zak found that oxytocin is also linked to morality and empathy, as it increases generosity and donations to charity. Zak argues that we are moral creatures due to our ability to empathize with others, and oxytocin is the molecule behind it. Knowing this molecule is valuable, particularly as it tells us what turns morality off, which points to why immorality occurs.

In this section of the video, Paul Zak talks about how trust and the release of oxytocin in the brain is closely linked. He discusses how people who don't release oxytocin on stimulus, through abuse, high stress, or long-term testosterone exposure, can be at risk for psychopathy or selfish behavior. Zak then describes the findings of his oxytocin experiments outside of the lab, including attending a wedding and skydiving with a stranger, and how they reveal the different ways people connect emotionally. Zak also found that social media use can increase oxytocin levels and lead to more human connection. Finally, Zak talks about his trip to Papua New Guinea and how even people living in isolated communities still have an innate ability to release oxytocin.

In this section, Paul Zak explains the connection between oxytocin and human connection. He highlights the ease at which oxytocin can be released, and suggests that something as simple as a hug can cause it. He prescribes "eight hugs a day" as a way to release more oxytocin, which results in happier individuals with better relationships of all types. He emphasizes that releasing more oxytocin can be achieved through various means, including tactile experiences or intranasal delivery.
