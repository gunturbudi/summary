# Summary of Why gender-based marketing is bad for business | Gaby Barrios

In this video, Gaby Barrios discusses why gender-based marketing is bad for businesses. Although it may seem like an efficient way to reach the target consumer, categorizing people by gender perpetuates stereotypes and wastes time and money. Instead, businesses should target consumer needs and behaviors rather than using gender alone. Gender was only the most predictive variable in about 5% of cases, so other factors should be considered. Barrios encourages businesses to challenge their instincts to use gender as a marketing tool and aim to do what is right, rather than what is easy.

In this section, Gaby Barrios discusses the use of gender-based marketing and how it is bad for businesses. Although categorizing people in buckets may seem like a shortcut to reach the target consumer efficiently, it is bad for business as it creates separation around genders and perpetuates stereotypes, wasting money and time. Gender is not the best place to start with marketing activities, and businesses should target the needs of consumers, rather than using gender alone. By taking an agnostic view of the consumer and removing yourself from biases and segments, a company can find disruptive growth in the market.

In this section, the speaker discusses how gender-based marketing can be bad for businesses since it distracts them from more crucial consumer insights. Results from over 100,000 consumer surveys show that gender was only the most predictive variable in about 5% of cases. Therefore, businesses should focus on other factors like consumer needs and behaviors, rather than excessively targeting specific genders. For instance, instead of targeting women in the food industry, it might be more beneficial for companies to target customers' eating behaviors and nutritional values. The speaker believes that it is important to start finding other ways of measuring consumer needs, so they don't activate a backslide into gender-based marketing.
