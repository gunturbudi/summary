# Summary of Hunting for dinosaurs showed me our place in the universe | Kenneth Lacovara

Kenneth Lacovara, a paleontologist, shares his formula for finding scientifically significant dinosaur fossils, which involves locating rocks of the right age in an unexplored desert. He reflects on the Earth's history and the importance of studying the past to gain perspective and humility. He emphasizes the fragility of our place on Earth and urges the audience to take action to prevent a potentially catastrophic outcome, as we have the ability to prevent it, unlike the dinosaurs who had no choice in their extinction due to a cosmic accident.

In this section of the video, Kenneth Lacovara explains the formula used by paleontologists to find fossils of extinct organisms like dinosaurs. The formula requires finding rocks of the right age, which is determined by the geological interval the organism existed in, sedimentary rocks that can make fossils, and layers of those rocks that are naturally exposed. However, it's not easy to find those rocks as the Earth is alive with geological processes on its lithosphere. The volumes of Earth history are incomplete and disheveled, making the library vast and magnificent. Nature provided no card catalog, and it wasn't until James Hutton's "Theory of the Earth" and William Smith's map of Britain that geologists were made aware of their connection and antiquity to deep time.

In this section, Kenneth Lacovara shares his formula for finding scientifically significant dinosaur fossils, which involves locating rocks of the right age in a desert that is largely unexplored by other paleontologists. Applying this formula, Lacovara and his team discovered the femur of a giant plant-eating dinosaur in Patagonia, which led to the subsequent excavation of 145 other bones of the same species, eventually named "Dreadnoughtus schrani." Lacovara explains that large herbivores like Dreadnoughtus are not passive creatures, but rather are models of efficiency and stability, as falling over could result in death for an animal as large as Dreadnoughtus.

In this section, Kenneth Lacovara reflects on the timeline of the Earth's history and the improbable events that led to the emergence of sentient beings capable of studying and understanding the ancient past. He highlights the fact that the dinosaurs did not have a choice in their extinction, which occurred due to a cosmic accident, emphasizing the importance of studying the past to gain perspective and humility. Despite the small chance of any individual entering the fossil record, the multitudinous creatures who have lived and died on the planet have left behind immense numbers of fossils, each one a small miracle, but collectively, inevitable. Our existence and the particular reality we live in were not inevitable, as the smallest perturbation of the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs would have caused it to miss Earth.

In this section, Kenneth Lacovara talks about how the fossil record shows that our place on Earth is fragile and our species is currently facing an environmental disaster on a large scale that could be compared to the sixth extinction. However, unlike the dinosaurs, we have the ability to see it coming and do something about it. Lacovara reminds the audience that the choice is ours and urges us to take action in order to prevent a potentially catastrophic outcome.
