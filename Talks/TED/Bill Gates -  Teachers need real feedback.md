# Summary of Bill Gates: Teachers need real feedback

In this video, Bill Gates advocates for a systematic feedback system for teachers to improve their teaching practice. He notes that countries that perform well academically have a formal system for helping teachers, citing Shanghai, China, as an example. The Measures of Effective Teaching project, which involves observers watching video of teachers in the classroom, provides promising results. Gates believes that video feedback can help teachers see what works and improve where needed. Despite the significant investment required to build a complete system, he highlights the importance of ensuring all students get a great education by providing teachers with the support they need.

In this section, Bill Gates emphasizes the need for systematic feedback for teachers, who have one of the most important jobs in the world but get almost no feedback to improve their practice. He compares the current one-word feedback system for teachers to coaches giving basketball players only a "satisfactory" grade and highlights the need for a system that helps all teachers be as good as the best. Gates discusses how countries that perform well academically have a formal system for helping teachers improve, such as Shanghai, China, which has weekly study groups and requires teachers to observe and give feedback to their colleagues. The Measures of Effective Teaching project, which involves observers watching video of teachers in the classroom and rating how they respond, provides promising results for a better feedback system for teachers.
