# Summary of The Story That Shapes Your Relationship with Nature | Damon Gameau | TED

Damon Gameau discusses how the stories we tell ourselves, especially the collective story that humans are superior to nature, shape our behavior towards the environment. He reveals how this story has led to the commodification of nature, where humans exploit it to obtain resources for economic gain. Despite the damage inflicted on nature, many people are still trapped in this cultural story, but there is hope. A regenerative story is emerging, supported by science, that shows how humans are interconnected with nature and dependent on it for survival. This story needs to be rapidly spread throughout our culture and embedded in all levels of curriculum to see the world as a living system.

In this section of the video, the speaker talks about the power of stories that we tell ourselves and how they influence our behavior towards the world. He says that apart from individual stories, collective stories also impact our behavior as a species. The collective story he addresses is that humans are separate and superior to nature. Damon Gameau suggests that this story has gotten us close to the brink of disaster, and the only way to survive is to tell a new one. He takes us back to history, where he explains how Christianity, along with leaders in modern science and philosophy, changed the collective story humans had with nature. They started treating nature as a machine to be manipulated for the benefit of mankind, which also meant obtaining resources through suppressive acts.

In this section, the speaker explains how humans have been exploiting nature by using it as a commodity for economic gain. The new story that emerged during the capitalist period depicted nature devoid of reverence, which made it easier to commodify. Humans have been using bulldozers, chainsaws, and filling waters with waste, amongst other activities, to harness natural resources. While researchers have found a dramatic decline in the words used to refer to nature and its elements, seven hours of daily screen time, and 10,000 ads encountered daily are further evidence of how the story of nature commodification has become deeply embedded within the human psyche. Despite the damage inflicted on nature, humans remain trapped in the story they have culturally programmed. However, children, farmers, indigenous people, and nature itself, through fires, droughts, and rising waters, are forcing their way back into the people's lives.

In this section of the video, Damon Gameau talks about the emergence of a regenerative story about human beings and nature. This story is supported by science and tells people that every breath they take is dependent on trees and phytoplankton, and that trillions of bacteria and fungi live on and in them. The same scientific inquiry that led to domination and extraction had gone so deep into nature's bosom that it was revealing her secrets. And her secrets were divulging that she was anything but mechanistic. Therefore, the new but old story will have to be rapidly spread throughout the culture and embedded in all levels of curriculum, so that people can see the world as a living system.
