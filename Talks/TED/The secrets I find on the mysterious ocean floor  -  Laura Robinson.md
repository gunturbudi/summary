Laura Robinson discusses her work as a marine biologist, focusing on the use of deep sea sponges and coral to understand ancient ocean conditions. She introduces a research-grade remotely operated vehicle, which she uses to explore the ocean floor. Robinson shows footage of a pyrosome, a colonial tunicate, and a black coral, among other organisms, and explains how these specimens are used to study ancient ocean conditions. She concludes the video with a discussion of her research and its implications for climate change.
