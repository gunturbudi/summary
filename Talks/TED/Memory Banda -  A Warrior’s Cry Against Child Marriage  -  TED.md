# Summary of Memory Banda: A Warrior’s Cry Against Child Marriage | TED

Memory Banda, a youth advocate against child marriages, shares her personal journey of standing up against the cultural tradition in Malawi where girls are taught at initiation camps how to sexually please men, leading to unwanted pregnancies and HIV/AIDS. She refused to attend these camps at 13 and instead pursued an education to become a lawyer. She founded an organization to teach young mothers to read and write, and convinced her traditional leader to pass a bylaw to protect girls from child marriage. Memory believes more work still needs to be done by leaders to protect girls' rights, and urges male advocates to join in the collective work towards ending child marriage. She concludes by saying that with collective effort, girls worldwide could say, "I will marry when I want."

In this section, Memory Banda shares a poem written by a 13-year-old girl from Malawi named Eileen Piri titled "I'll Marry When I Want." In Malawi, gender equality is questionable where girls are taught at initiation camps how to sexually please a man. Most girls end up pregnant and contract HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. Memory’s little sister was 11 years old when she became pregnant, and is now 16 years old with three children – all from failed marriages. In contrast, Memory refused to go to the initiation camp at 13 and was forced to leave her family. Her decision led to her becoming a youth advocate against child marriages.
