In this song, Naughty by Nature discusses cheating on one's partner and how scientists have had to come up with new definitions of monogamy due to the advent of DNA sequencing technology. The song is about a man who refers to cheating as "opp" and describes several different types of cheating. Biological monogamy, which was previously thought to be the norm among bird species, is now known to only occur in a handful of species. Social monogamy is when one partner provides care for the other's offspring outside of a relationship. Extra-pair copulation is when one partner has sex with someone other than their partner.
