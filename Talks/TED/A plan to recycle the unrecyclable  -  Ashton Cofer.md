# Summary of A plan to recycle the unrecyclable | Ashton Cofer

Ashton Cofer discusses his team's project aimed at recycling the unrecyclable - Styrofoam waste. Through a series of failed experiments, the team was able to extract activated carbon from Styrofoam waste, which can be used for water filtration, thereby solving two environmental problems at once. Ashton also discusses the funding and awards his team received for their project and how they plan to continue working on it. He emphasizes the importance of perseverance and learning from failures to achieve success.

In this section, Ashton Cofer talks about his project with a team for the FIRST LEGO League, where they explored and researched ways to tackle the issue of Styrofoam waste, which cannot be efficiently recycled. Through many failed experiments, the team was able to extract activated carbon from Styrofoam waste, which can be used for water filtration. This solution not only cleans water but also reduces Styrofoam waste, solving two problems at once. The project showed the importance of perseverance and not giving up in the face of failures.

In this section, Ashton Cofer discusses the funding and awards that his team received for their innovative recycling project. The team was able to secure funding from various sources such as the NSTA's eCYBERMISSION STEM-in-Action program, FIRST Global Innovation Awards sponsored by XPRIZE, and the Scientific American Innovator Award from Google Science Fair. With these funds, they plan to file a full patent on their process and continue working on the project. Although they encountered failures, the team persevered, making the impossible possible, and learned that success cannot be achieved without a little bit of failure.
