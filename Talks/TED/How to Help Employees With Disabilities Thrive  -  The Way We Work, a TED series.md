In this section, the speaker addresses the issue of the disability employment gap and the importance of hiring disabled people based on their strengths and abilities rather than for the sake of meeting a quota. One key factor that leads to this gap is the pervasive assumption that people with disabilities are unable to perform certain tasks, without asking for their input on how they can tackle the job. To bridge the gap, companies must also adopt an inclusive approach, rethinking accessibility and accommodations, creating spaces with disability and accessibility in mind, and embracing flexibility, as disabled individuals have had to do their whole lives. Embracing these measures can help companies hire, retain, fairly pay, and amplify the efforts of disabled employees.
