# Summary of Taiye Selasi: Don't ask where I'm from, ask where I'm a local | TED

Taiye Selasi challenges the notion of national identity and being asked where she's from in this TED Talk. Instead, she believes that acknowledging multiple localities and layers of identity can bring us closer together as human beings. She proposes a three-step test to determine where someone is a local, which includes considering their daily rituals, relationships, and restrictions. By doing so, individuals can gain a better understanding of their local context and how it shapes their identity. Selasi suggests that we introduce ourselves in terms of our multiple localities rather than a singular national identity.

In this section, Taiye Selasi shares her experience of being introduced as coming from multiple countries, which made her question what it meant to come from a nation. She realized that countries are not naturally occurring, fixed points in time and that in reality, countries can be born, die, expand, and contract, making them hardly a basis for understanding a person's identity. Selasi sought to redefine her identity beyond the logic of the state and ultimately realized that all experience is local, and all identity is experience.

In this section, Taiye Selasi talks about how the question "Where are you from?" limits people's experiences and identities, and instead proposes asking "Where are you a local?" Selasi explains that the places and experiences that shape our lives make up our identities, rather than our nationality or where we were born. She proposes a three-step test to determine where someone is a local, which includes considering their daily rituals, relationships, and restrictions. By doing so, individuals can gain a better understanding of their local context and how it shapes their identity.

In this section, Taiye Selasi argues that focusing on the concept of nationality distracts us from the common experiences that people share. As an example, she highlights how both Udo from Argentina and Olu, who looks Nigerian, are restricted by the political conditions of their parents' countries. The difference between where someone is from and where they are a local is not the specificity of the answer, but the intention of the question. Asking where someone is a local instead of where they are from shifts the focus to where real life occurs, and how overlapping experiences merge together. Selasi is not advocating for the abolishment of countries, but rather seeking to question the primacy of countries as the unit of measurement for human experience. Ultimately, what we are talking about is human experience, and not national experience.

In this section, Taiye Selasi argues against the notion of national identity and being asked where she's from. Instead, she believes that acknowledging our multiple localities and layers of identity can bring us closer together as human beings. In creative writing, the local setting adds texture and humanity to characters, and this same principle can be applied to our understanding of people in real life. Selasi suggests that we introduce ourselves in terms of our multiple localities rather than a singular national identity.
