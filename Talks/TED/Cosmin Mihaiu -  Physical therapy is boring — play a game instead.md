# Summary of Cosmin Mihaiu: Physical therapy is boring â€” play a game instead

Cosmin Mihaiu discusses how physical therapy can be improved by playing video games instead of the traditional method. He and three friends created a software platform that would make physical therapy more engaging for patients. The first game featured in the video is designed to strengthen muscles and improve balance. The other games are designed for preventing falls, for orthopedic patients or for patients with mental health or speech therapy. Cosmin's physical therapist can view his data and adjust his treatment accordingly. The device is less than $1,000 and can be used in clinics. The hope is to make the device available at home so that patients can continue their physical therapy at their convenience.
