This is a transcript of a video about creativity and play, in which researcher Bob McKim discusses the results of a study in which he gets students to draw the person sitting next to them quickly on a piece of paper. The students invariably produce artwork that is filled with embarrassment and apologies for being too bold. However, when the exercise is done with children, there is no such inhibition and they happily show their work to anyone. As adults, we become more inhibited in our creativity as we become more sensitive to the opinions of others. This inhibition can be overcome by creating an environment where people feel secure and free to be creative.

In this video, Tim Brown demonstrates how to use circles to create objects, such as a football or sun, during a minute. He explains that this is a form of play, and that adults often self-edit their ideas. The experiment done by Bob McKim in the 1960s showed that mescaline had a positive effect on creativity.

Tim Brown discusses the benefits of experimentation, building prototypes, and role-play in design. He believes that these practices are important for advancing ideas and achieving successful outcomes. preschools should be filled with these sorts of activities to help foster creativity and problem-solving skills in children, but this type of play is often lost as children move through school. By giving project teams and the clients they work with permission to think with their hands, complex ideas can be easily developed and executed.

Designers use playful exploration and role-play to think about and prototype experiences. Kids play tea party and cops and robbers, following a script that they've agreed to. Play is not anarchy, and it has rules that lead to productive play.

In this talk, Tim Brown discusses the importance of trust in play, and how it can be beneficial to both creativity and professional design. He shares a few behavioral traits that are commonly associated with play, and argues that designers need to be able to move between divergent and convergent modes of operation to be successful.
