In this section, Toni Griffin discusses her involvement in the planning process for Detroit's future, which began in 2010. Griffin brought her experience in urban justice to the table, coming from other contested cities such as Chicago and Newark. Despite the magazine headlines asking if a single person could save a city, Griffin saw her role as just one part of a larger process of recovery. When the planning process began, Detroit was grappling with issues of housing collapse and population decline, leaving many neighborhoods sparsely populated with 80,000 vacant homes. Throughout the process, Detroiters raised questions and concerns about displacement and property ownership, revealing the deeply personal histories of Detroit's African-American communities that had been affected by migration and deindustrialization.
