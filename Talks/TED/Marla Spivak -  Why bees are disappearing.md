# Summary of Marla Spivak: Why bees are disappearing

In the video "Marla Spivak: Why bees are disappearing," Marla Spivak discusses the importance of bees as pollinators of crops and flower-feeders that provide valuable pollination services. She explains the challenges of hand pollination and the role of bees in pollination. Spivak also highlights the social life and super-organism characteristics of honeybees, as well as their natural defenses, like propolis. However, she explains that over the past 50 years, bees have been dying due to multiple causes, including the elimination of flowering plants and increased pesticide use. Spivak urges the audience to take action, such as planting bee-friendly flowers and avoiding pesticides, to support bees and prevent further decline. She emphasizes that the bee population decline reflects issues with our food system and that small individual actions can have a grand impact on the survival of bees and the larger ecosystem.

In this section, Marla Spivak explains the importance of bees as pollinators of crops, as well as their characteristics as flower-feeders that provide a valuable pollination service while collecting food themselves. She also discusses the role of bees in plant pollination and the challenges of hand pollination using examples such as tomato growers. Additionally, Spivak shares her experience of working for a commercial beekeeper and her obsession with the complex social life and super-organism characteristics of honeybees, highlighting their collective decision-making, task differentiation, humor, and social healthcare behaviors, such as the study of hygiene and resins by her lab.

In this section, Marla Spivak explains that honeybees have natural defenses that have kept them healthy and thriving for over 50 million years, one of which is propolis, a natural antibiotic that bolsters the colony health and their social immunity. However, over the past 50 years, bees have been dying from multiple and interacting causes, including the elimination of flowering plants that bees need for survival and the increase in pesticide use. The monoculture farming practices that started after World War II, such as using synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, have resulted in a flowerless landscape and a dysfunctional food system. The bee population decline reflects the issues with our food system, and we need to take action to change it.

In this section, Marla Spivak explains the multiple causes of death for bees, including pesticides, diseases, and parasites. She urges the audience to take direct and easy actions to support bees, such as planting bee-friendly flowers and avoiding the use of pesticides. Spivak emphasizes that these small individual actions can have a grand impact on the survival of bees and the larger ecosystem.

In this section, Maria Spivak explains that the die-off of bees in the United States is getting critical, with an average of 30% of all bee hives lost every winter, as compared to 15% just 20 years ago. Although beekeepers are able to divide their colonies and maintain the same number, they are at a tipping point and cannot afford to lose many more bees. Thus, she urges the audience to appreciate beekeepers and plant flowers to prevent further decline.
