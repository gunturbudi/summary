# Summary of A 3-Part Plan to Take On Extreme Heat Waves | Eleni Myrivili | TED

Eleni Myrivili presents a three-part plan to combat extreme heat waves in urban environments. The first part involves increasing awareness and preparedness among vulnerable populations through short-term measures, such as smartphone apps, buddy systems, and air conditioning distribution. The second part involves redesigning urban environments to make them cooler and less reliant on fossil fuels, by increasing nature in urban areas, such as trees, biodiversity, and water. The final part is about cities building redundancies and flexibility to create more sustainable and equitable systems, as well as learning from each other through powerful urban networks that support cities in their efforts to build resilience. The message is that simply relying on air conditioning is not enough to tackle the problem of extreme heat waves and climate change.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
In this section, we learn about the threat of extreme heat in urban environments, how it is deadly, and how very few people are aware of this. Heat is often overlooked as it quietly destroys and there is little escape from it. The poor, elderly, pregnant women, children, and people with manual jobs are most vulnerable. Heat also affects the productivity of workers, lowers children's learning abilities, and has been baking farmers' crops. As the infrastructures that we have built were engineered for a climate that no longer exists, Eleni Myrivili's three general categories of possible efforts are awareness, preparedness, and redesign. To create awareness, heat waves will be named and categorized like hurricanes, as people do not sufficiently take heat exposure seriously.

In this section, the speaker explains a three-part plan to combat extreme heat waves. The first part involves increasing awareness and preparedness among vulnerable populations through short-term measures, such as smartphone apps, buddy systems, and air conditioning distribution. However, the ultimate goal is to redesign urban environments to make them cooler and less reliant on fossil fuels. This involves a paradigm shift in urban design, led by landscape architects who prioritize factors such as thermodynamics, soil health, and biodiversity. By radically increasing nature in urban areas, such as trees, biodiversity, and water, cities can bring down the heat and build resilience to current climate conditions.

In this section, Eleni Myrivili emphasizes the importance of cities thinking carefully about their resources and building redundancies and flexibility to create more sustainable and equitable systems. Cities can learn from each other through powerful urban networks, such as the Resilient Cities Network and C40, that support cities in their efforts to build resilience. Myrivili provides examples of cities, such as Athens and Melbourne, that have implemented strategies to build resilience through natural systems, such as using an aqueduct to lower heat and support urban nature, and creating a Nature in the City Strategy to ensure that the urban environment is healthy and rich for future generations. The lesson is clear: simply cranking up the air conditioning is not enough to combat extreme heat waves and climate change.
