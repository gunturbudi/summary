# Summary of Alice Goffman: How we're priming some kids for college â€” and others for prison

Alice Goffman discusses the two institutions overseeing the American journey to adulthood: college and prison. While acknowledging the benefits of college, she highlights the shortcomings, such as high costs and resulting debt. On the other hand, she addresses the increasing prevalence of prison, particularly for poor African-American and Latino children. Goffman explains the constant monitoring and punishment to which these children are subjected, preventing them from fulfilling the American Dream and leaving them with a permanent criminal record. Goffman argues that community-based education, rather than incarceration, could lead to a better future for all. She also stresses the need for a criminal justice system that prioritizes prevention, recovery, and inclusion, rather than just punishment. Goffman encourages young people to continue fighting to end mass incarceration and build a new justice system.

In this section, Alice Goffman discusses how the American journey to adulthood is overseen by two institutions - college and prison. She highlights the shortcomings of college, such as expensive tuition fees that leave students in debt, but acknowledges that overall it is a good path to a better future. However, Goffman notes that the second institution overseeing the journey, prison, is becoming increasingly prevalent, with more and more children from poor, African-American, and Latino communities being sent there. She highlights the hidden underside of this 'historic experiment in punishment', which sees young people constantly subjected to searches and seizures by the police, court fees, probation and parole restrictions, low-level warrants, and a police force motivated to make arrest counts to line city coffers. This, in turn, prevents them from fulfilling the American Dream, and leaving them with a permanent mark on their criminal records when they come home and apply for work.

She laments the fact that children like Chuck and Tim are often seen as deserving of punishment rather than support, and suggests that a community focused on education rather than incarceration could lead to a brighter future for all.
