# Summary of Paul MacCready: Flying on solar wings

Paul MacCready, founder of AeroVironment and known for human-powered flight, discusses his diverse interests and background in weather modification. His fascination with bird flight led to his breakthrough in human-powered flight with the development of the Gossamer-Condor, which won a one-mile flight prize in 1977. He then turned to solar-powered planes to raise awareness about solar power and its importance, as well as fears that the government might decrease funding in this field. MacCready focuses on the impact of human population growth and the imminent decline of gasoline production, arguing for the need to move towards using solar and renewable energy sources. He also showcases his innovative approach to aircraft design, from solar-powered planes to miniature drones to a simple glider.

In this section, Paul MacCready, known for human-powered flight and founder of AeroVironment, discusses his diverse interests and background in weather modification. He mentions how he once had a $100,000 debt and became interested in human-powered flight after learning about the Kramer prize. MacCready explains how his fascination with bird flight led to his breakthrough in human-powered flight and how his company slowly grew from small projects.

In this section, Paul MacCready discusses the development of the Gossamer-Condor, a human-powered aircraft that won a one-mile flight prize in 1977. The team later modified the design and won a new prize with the Gossamer Albatross by flying it across the English Channel. MacCready explains that he and his team then turned to solar-powered planes because they wanted to raise awareness about solar power and its importance, as well as fears that the government might decrease funding in this field. He later focuses on environmental issues, which led him to think about how damaging humans have been to the environment in a relatively short period of time, including the pollution caused by using underground coal.

In this section, Paul MacCready discusses the impact of human population growth and the imminent decline of gasoline production. He shows a slide depicting the weight of all air and land vertebrates from 1850 to 2050, highlighting the significant increase of humans, livestock, and pets. MacCready argues that the dominance of humans is a real and serious problem, citing the need to move towards using solar and renewable energy sources. He also mentions his art, which includes a painting that shows the Earth's timeline, from trilobites and dinosaurs to the present-day civilization and cockroaches, as a warning for the future.

In this section, we see Paul MacCready showcasing some of his achievements in aviation, including the Helios, a solar-powered plane that set a new altitude record of more than 96,000 feet. He also presents the AV Pointer, a miniature surveillance drone that can navigate autonomously, as well as the Walkalong Glider, a simple device that can soar on the lift over a person's body. MacCready's sons helped build some of these devices, including the Gossamer Condor, which was created over 25 years ago. Overall, MacCready displays his innovative approach to aircraft design, from solar-powered planes to miniature drones to a simple glider.

In this section, Paul MacCready demonstrates a remote-controlled flying device that can be easily controlled in flight and used for surveillance. He notes that it is a collector's item that is no longer in production. MacCready explains that he chose this device because it was more gentle than bringing an airplane and risking hitting people in the room.
