# Summary of The next software revolution: programming biological cells | Sara-Jane Dunn

The living software revolution is the future of programming, where biochemistry is programmed into biology to develop therapies, reprogram cells, and build programmable operating systems. The concept of biology as computation can help identify and correct faulty cells, design synthetic circuits, and exploit the computational power of biochemistry. The use of embryonic stem cells in medicine is beneficial, yet their cell fate is still a process of trial and error. Sara-Jane Dunn's team developed a tool to encode observations of embryonic stem cells as mathematical expressions that could uncover the first molecular program to explain cell behavior. Dunn suggests the creation of new tools and languages that allow designing biological functions and developing a living software compiler that compiles down to the machine code of cell biochemistry. By doing so, breakthrough applications and industries can be built in different fields, such as agriculture, medicine, energy, materials, and computing.

In this section, the video explains that the next software revolution will be the living software revolution powered by the ability to program biochemistry on biology. By programming biology, humans can harness the properties of biology to generate new kinds of therapies, repair damaged tissues, reprogram faulty cells, or even build programmable operating systems. Programming biology is not as simple as programming a computer, as living systems self-generate, self-organize, and operate at molecular scales. However, the idea of biology as computation opens doors to understand how and why cells do what they do, leading to debugging programs and learning how to design synthetic circuits to exploit the computational power of biochemistry.

In this section, the speaker discusses the potential of embryonic stem cells for medicine and the challenges in learning how to harness them. Stem cells can transform into any adult cell type, making them ideal for generating cells that can repair diseased or damaged tissue in patients. However, the challenge lies in figuring out how to change cell fate, which is still a process of trial and error. The speaker's team developed a tool that encodes observations of embryonic stem cells as mathematical expressions, allowing for the uncovering of the first molecular program that could explain all of them, and prediction of the cell's behavior.

In this section, Sara-Jane Dunn explains how she and her team developed a program to probe stem cells, that allowed them to accelerate progress and target specific genes in the process. She explains that programming biology is not specific to stem cells, and that the field needs to develop new approaches that understand biological computation more broadly at different levels, from DNA through to the flow of information between cells, so as to harness biology in ways that are predictable and reliable. Dunn suggests the creation of new tools and languages that allow both experimentalists and computational scientists to design biological function, and develop a living software compiler that compiles down to the machine code of the cell's biochemistry. She states the idea that by understanding the program of quantum interactions that allow plants to absorb sunlight so efficiently, synthetic DNA circuits could be developed to offer materials for better solar cells. Dunn concludes that by realizing the creation of an operating system that runs living software, it would allow us to build breakthrough applications and industries in different fields like agriculture, medicine, energy and materials, and computing itself.
