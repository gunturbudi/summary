# Summary of Jim Hagemann Snabe: Dreams and details for a decarbonized future | TED Countdown

Jim Hagemann Snabe, Chairman of A.P. Moller - Maersk, discusses the urgent need for the transportation industry to become carbon-neutral by 2050. To achieve this goal, the company aimed to invent a zero-carbon container vessel by 2030 and donated 400 million Danish Krone to create a global center for zero-carbon shipping. Snabe also addresses power-to-X as a solution, converting green electricity to green hydrogen and then to various types of green fuel. Scaling the technology and reducing costs require investment and government leadership in implementing a global price on carbon, with an estimated total investment of around two trillion dollars. He also emphasizes the business opportunities for sustainable solutions and Maersk's significant investments in green fuel production. Leadership and collaboration around critical details are needed to achieve a sustainable future.

In this section, Jim Hagemann Snabe, Chairman of the global shipping company A.P. Moller - Maersk, discusses the urgent need to transform the transportation industry to be sustainably carbon-neutral by 2050. He explains the dream was to invent a zero-carbon container vessel by 2030 to replace the 750 vessels that Maersk operates, which required a lot of attention to details. Snabe mentions that sails, batteries, and LNG, as well as slow-steaming, would not solve the problem, and it was evident that they could not do it alone, so the company needed to look for other solutions. The A.P. Moller Foundation donated 400 million Danish Krone to create a global center for zero-carbon shipping in Copenhagen to bring people and companies together to help them find a sustainable transport solution.

In this section, Jim Hagemann Snabe discusses the solution to achieving zero-carbon shipping and other industries: power-to-X. Power-to-X converts green electricity from solar or wind to green hydrogen, which can be turned into various types of green fuel through chemical processes. This produces a green fuel that is liquid at normal temperature, unlike electricity, which can be used in combustion engines. The challenges of implementing this solution involve scaling the technology and reducing costs, which requires investment and government leadership in implementing a global price on carbon. The estimate to achieve this solution is a total investment of around two trillion dollars, which is equivalent to four years of capital expenditure in the oil and gas industry.

In this section of the video, Jim Hagemann Snabe discusses the business opportunities that will arise from the significantly higher demand for green fuel than the supply. He emphasizes that investing in sustainable solutions has become good for business. He also mentions Maersk's significant investments in green fuel production, which seemed impossible only three years ago but are becoming a reality now, seven years ahead of their original plan. Snabe concludes that what we need to achieve a sustainable future is leadership and collaboration around critical details.
