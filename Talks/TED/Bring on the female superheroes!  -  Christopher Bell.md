In this YouTube video, Christopher Bell discusses the lack of representation of female superheroes in media, and how media companies use their power to influence societal norms and beliefs through public pedagogy. Bell points out that media companies control the conversations by directing what individuals think and not what they think about, and the lack of female representation in superhero media sends a negative message not only to girls but also to boys. He highlights recent changes made by Target, Disney, and Mattel to introduce more female superheroes to their product lines, and encourages parents to buy their kids toys that feature both male and female characters.

In this section, Professor Christopher Bell discusses how media companies influence societal norms and beliefs through public pedagogy, which is the process of how societies are taught ideologies. He expresses concern over the lack of representation of female superheroes in media and explains how the distribution of information through media is tied to financial gain for these corporate entities. He points out that in 1983, 90% of American media was owned by 50 companies, but in 2015, this number has shrunk to six, which raises the issue of just how much influence these companies have over what people are allowed to see every day.

In this section, Christopher Bell discusses how media controls the conversations by directing what individuals think and not what they think about. He cites The Walt Disney Company and how they have made most of their money by selling princesses to girls since 1937. However, when Disney purchased LucasFilms in 2012, they flooded the stores with Han Solo and Obi-Wan Kenobi and not Princess Leia because Leia messes up the public pedagogy for these princesses. Furthermore, when individuals requested Princess Leia merchandise, Disney replied with the intent of having no Princess Leia merchandise in their stores. Bell highlights that there is no Black Widow merchandise available even though she played the star of five different Marvel movies, and despite Scarlett Johansson being one of the most popular actresses in America.

Bell believes that this is unfair and that society needs to do better for its children. He cites examples of recent changes made by Target, Disney and Mattel to stop gendering their toy aisles and Halloween costumes and to introduce more female superheroes to their product lines, and he encourages parents to buy their kids toys that feature both male and female characters.
