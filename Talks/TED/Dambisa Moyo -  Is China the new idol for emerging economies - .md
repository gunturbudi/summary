# Summary of Dambisa Moyo: Is China the new idol for emerging economies?

Dambisa Moyo discusses the growing schism between developed and developing countries regarding political and economic rights, as well as the increasing popularity of China's state capitalism and prioritization of economic rights over political rights among people in emerging markets. She suggests that the West has two options: continue to compete with China's model or cooperate and give emerging market countries the flexibility to create their own economic systems. Moyo argues that instead of criticizing China, the West should encourage businesses to invest and trade in those regions, demonstrating the superiority of its own model without shoehorning democracy. She also emphasizes the need for an open-minded approach in evaluating different economic systems and questioning assumptions surrounding democracy, capitalism, poverty reduction, and freedom.

In this section, Dambisa Moyo discusses the schism between developed and developing countries with regards to political and economic rights.

In this section, Dambisa Moyo explains why China's system is gaining momentum among people in emerging markets as it promises the best and fastest improvements in living standards. According to Moyo, China's economic performance over the past 30 years has been significant in moving over 300 million people out of poverty and improving income equality without changing the political construct. People are also impressed by China's legendary infrastructure rollout and methods to solve social problems, making them think that China's system is the one that works. Furthermore, there is growing doubt among people in the emerging markets that democracy is a prerequisite for economic growth, and countries like Taiwan, Singapore, Chile, and China have shown that economic growth is the prerequisite for democracy.

She suggests that the West has two options: continue to compete with China's model of state capitalism and deprioritized democracy or cooperate and give emerging market countries the flexibility to experiment and create their own organic economic systems. Moyo argues that instead of criticizing China, the West should be encouraging its businesses to trade and invest in those regions, demonstrating how its own model of politics and economics is superior without shoehorning democracy around the world.
