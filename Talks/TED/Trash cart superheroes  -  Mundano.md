# Summary of Trash cart superheroes | Mundano

The video is about Mundano, a graffiti artist and activist who started painting the carts of the catadores in Brazil, who are workers that collect recyclable materials for a living. This led to the creation of a collaborative movement called Pimp My Carroça, providing better safety, sanitary and general wellness for the catadores. Over 170 catadores, 800 volunteers, and 200 street artists have been involved in the movement, increasing their visibility and income. Mundano encourages us to see other "invisible superheroes" in our cities and acknowledge them, thanking them for their contributions.

In this section, we learn about Mundano's work with the catadores, who are workers that collect recyclable materials for a living in Brazil. Mundano is a graffiti artist and activist who started painting the catadores' carts or carroças making them more aesthetically pleasing. This led to the creation of a collaborative movement called Pimp My Carroça which is a large crowdfunded event to provide better safety, sanitary and general wellness for the catadores. Since its creation, over 170 catadores, 800 volunteers, and 200 street artists have been involved in the movement. Through this movement, catadores have become increasingly respected and valued, leaving invisibility behind and increasing their income by gaining more interaction with society. Mundano encourages us to see other "invisible superheroes" in our cities and to acknowledge them.
