# Summary of The science of cells that never get old | Elizabeth Blackburn

The video discusses the science of cells that never get old, and how chronic stress can lead to shorter telomeres. It explains that telomeres can be affected by factors such as childhood neglect, violence, and racism, and that this can have long-term consequences for health. The video ends with a message urging people to invest in curiosity for the sake of the future.

Elizabeth Blackburn, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist, discusses the science of cells that never get old. Telomerase is an enzyme that helps cells keep their telomeres intact, which helps prevent cells from dying. When cells divide, all of their DNA has to be copied, including the telomerase enzyme, which can shorten telomeres. Blackburn and her student, Carol Greider, discovered that cells have a telomerase enzyme that can replenish telomeres, and they named it telomerase. When telomerase is removed, the telomeres of the cells run down and they die.

Elizabeth Blackburn is a Nobel Prize-winning biologist who studies the effects of stress on telomeres. She notes that although telomerase can be used to elongate telomeres, doing so also increases the risk for cancer. Blackburn advises maintaining a healthy health span, rather than focusing on lengthening lifespan or immortality.

The video presents research on cells that never get old, and discusses how chronic stress can lead to shorter telomeres. The video then goes on to discuss how some people are able to maintain their telomeres despite being under chronic stress, and cites studies that suggest attitudes have a big impact on how we age.

This video discusses the science of cells, focusing on how telomeres (the caps on the ends of chromosomes) can be affected by physical and emotional stress. It explains that telomeres can be affected by factors such as childhood neglect, violence, and racism, and that this can have long-term consequences for health. It also discusses the importance of curiosity and how it can impact the world. The video ends with a message urging people to invest in curiosity for the sake of the future.
