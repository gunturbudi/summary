# Summary of How fear of nuclear power is hurting the environment | Michael Shellenberger

Michael Shellenberger discusses in his video how the fear of nuclear power is hurting the environment. He highlights the decline of clean energy and the increase of fossil fuels, where nuclear energy has been in absolute decline due to the potential safety of plants, waste produced, and association with nuclear weapons. The fear of nuclear power has led to countries taking nuclear plants offline and replacing them with fossil fuels. Shellenberger argues that nuclear energy is the safest way to produce reliable energy and that the most important thing to overcome the climate crisis is to understand that the clean energy crisis is from within people, not within machines.

In this section, Michael Shellenberger discusses how the global increase in clean energy has not improved climate change as much as people had hoped. Clean energy sources have dropped from 36% to 31% of global electricity in the past 20 years. Fossil fuels are increasing faster than clean energy and one source in particular, nuclear energy, has been in an absolute decline. Solar and wind collectively only make up half of the decline from nuclear. When California retired four nuclear power plants, almost as much clean energy electricity generated by solar was wiped out due to the use of fossil fuels. California reduced emissions more slowly than the national average between 2000 and 2015 and German emissions have been increasing since 2009. The need for natural gas backup to counteract solar and wind's downtime creates methane gas leaks and environmental problems.

In this section, the speaker discusses the potential of nuclear power as a clean energy source in mitigating the effects of climate change. However, despite the fact that nuclear energy is considered a low-carbon source of energy, it remains unpopular due to concerns over the safety of plants, the waste produced, and the association with nuclear weapons. The speaker admits the need for technological fixes to solve these problems. Although the Chinese have attempted to launch this type of nuclear power, they have faced multiple challenges that make it difficult to commercialize in the short term. Other reactors, such as the high-temperature gas reactor, are also expensive and have failed to become cheaper than conventional reactors.

In this section, Michael Shellenberger discusses the risk of losing clean energy due to the fear of nuclear power. He explains how Japan took its nuclear plants offline and replaced them with coal, natural gas, and oil burning, while only bringing a third to two-thirds of the plants online. Shellenberger goes on to say that the world is at risk of losing four times more clean energy than the amount lost over the last decade, and we are in a clean energy crisis. Despite the engineers looking for technical fixes to people’s fear of nuclear, nuclear power is the safest way to produce reliable energy. The waste created from nuclear energy is minimal compared to pollution. It is only considered dangerous because of people’s fears. Shellenberger believes the most important thing to overcome the climate crisis is to understand the cause of the clean energy crisis is from within us, not within the machines.
