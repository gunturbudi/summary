# Summary of Can we create new senses for humans? | David Eagleman

Neuroscientist David Eagleman discusses the limitations of human senses and the potential for technology to create new senses and expand our perception of the world. He explores the concept of sensory substitution, where technology can feed information through unusual sensory channels that the brain can easily comprehend. Eagleman has conducted experiments with sensory substitution technologies such as a vest that allows users to receive feedback on the movements of the planet and an automated sentiment analysis of Twitter in real-time. He also discusses the potential for creating a new sense to "feel" the state of data, which could have practical applications in heavy machinery and manufacturing. Overall, Eagleman envisions limitless possibilities for human expansion with modern advancements in technology.

In this section, David Eagleman discusses the limitations of human senses and how our perception of reality is limited by our biology. He notes that humans can only detect a small fraction of what is actually happening in the world around them due to the biological receptors they possess. However, technology has allowed for the expansion of our "umwelt," the German word for surrounding world, with artificial hearing and vision, made possible by digitizing signals and plugging in electrode grids. Eagleman believes that technology has the potential to create new senses for humans, expanding our perception of the world and potentially changing the human experience.

In this section, David Eagleman explains how the brain is a 'general purpose computing device' that can utilize different data cables without knowing or caring where the data originates. This is why nature can frequently create and try new peripherals, which are understood by the brain without requiring it to be redesigned. He goes on to provide proof of this through the concept of sensory substitution, where feeding information through unusual sensory channels can be easily comprehended by the brain. Eaglesman details specific examples such as the sonic glasses, the electrotactile grid on the forehead, and the BrainPort which creates electrotactile signals that are interpreted by the tongue.

In this section, neuroscientist David Eagleman explains how he is working on a sensory substitution technology that converts sound into vibrations on the body, allowing deaf people to understand language. Testing with deaf participants has been successful so far, and the vest technology can be built for much cheaper than the current solution, cochlear implants. Eagleman is also exploring possibilities for sensory addition, using technology to add entirely new senses and expand the human umvelt, such as by feeding real-time data from the internet directly into somebody's brain.

In this section, neuroscientist David Eagleman discusses the potential for expanding the human umvelt and creating new senses for humans. He has conducted experiments where he created a vest that allows users to receive feedback on the movements of the planet and an automated sentiment analysis of Twitter in real-time. Eagleman also envisions expanding the umvelt for pilots by streaming essential data and allowing them to feel it instead of just reading it. He poses the question, “how do you want to go out and experience your universe?” and discusses the limitless possibilities for human expansion with modern advancements in technology.

In this section, David Eagleman explains that our visual systems are not well-suited to handle the vast amount of data presented on screens today, and that creating a new sense to “feel” the state of data could be beneficial. Eagleman suggests that this new sense could have practical applications in heavy machinery and manufacturing to help workers better interact with and understand the state of their equipment.
