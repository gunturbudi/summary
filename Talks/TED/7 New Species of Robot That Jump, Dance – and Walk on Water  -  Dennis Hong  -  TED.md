# Summary of 7 New Species of Robot That Jump, Dance – and Walk on Water | Dennis Hong | TED

Dennis Hong, a robotics expert, introduces seven new robots in his TED talk. He discusses how his team at the Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory designed the robots to overcome certain limitations of humanoid robots, such as instability, slow movement, complexity, cost, and danger. The robots he presents are equipped with BEAR actuators for biomechanical motion, such as walking, jumping, and hopping, and can perform various movements like climbing on walls, rolling over rough terrain, and even walking on water. Hong also reveals that the secret to their productivity and creativity is openness, trust, freedom, and fun, and ends by showing a video of his lab dancing with their new seven species of robots.

In this section, Dennis Hong introduces his lab's development of humanoid robots and explains their limitations such as their instability, slow movement, complexity, cost, and danger. Hong then explains how he came to the realization that walking with two feet is difficult for robots, leading him to develop a type of robot that can walk sideways without feet or ankles. Such robots can climb over obstacles and are highly maneuverable, as demonstrated by a video of a robot competition. Hong's lab used the idea of this new robot to develop the SAFFiR robot for Navy ships, which can rotate its knees 360 degrees and climb stairs using various techniques such as energy storage in its feet.

In this section, Dennis Hong introduces three new robots – ALPHRED, NABi-2 and HEX – that are equipped with BEAR actuators for biomechanical motion, such as walking, jumping and hopping. ALPHRED can switch between bipedal and quadrupedal movement and has strong and stable walking capabilities. Meanwhile, HEX is a six-legged robot designed for outdoor terrains and demining applications. Lastly, SiLVIA, a smaller version of HEX, can move with ease across staircases and uneven surfaces. The BEAR actuator not only makes the robots more efficient but also enables them to generate electricity when they move.

In this section, robotics expert Dennis Hong introduces several innovative robots with unique abilities. He showcases SILVIA, a robot that can climb cliffs, climb between walls and roll over rough terrain. Hong also showcases OmBURo, a single-wheeled robot that can move in any direction and navigate crowdy and obstacle-filled environments. Lastly, he introduces BALLU, an inflatable humanoid robot that can walk and dance with the aid of a helium balloon, and is designed to be safe for close human interaction.

In this section, Dennis Hong shows the latest robot called ARTEMIS, which is based on BEAR actuator technology and is designed and fabricated from scratch. He discloses that this is the first time he has shown the robot in public and it will make an appearance in his next talk. Hong ends the talk by revealing that the secret to their productivity and creativity is openness, trust, freedom, and fun, and by showing a video of his lab dancing with their new seven species of robots.
