In this section, Reed Hastings, co-founder of Netflix, talks about the company's decision to invest in original content and introduce the idea of binge-watching. The decision was not an easy one, as it represented a significant percentage of the company's revenue at the time, and the concept of releasing a whole season at one time had not been tested before. However, the success of House of Cards, Narcos, Jessica Jones, and other original Netflix series speaks for itself. The company's long-term plan is to invest around eight billion dollars in new content globally, but Hastings acknowledges that they have a long way to go and competition from other networks, including Disney, is fierce.
