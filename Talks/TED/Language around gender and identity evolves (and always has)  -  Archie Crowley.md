In this section, Archie Crowley talks about the importance of language in identifying oneself and creating relationships that affirm one's identity. Choosing one's own identifying language is crucial for trans people, and sometimes the common lexicon does not hold the words that a person needs. Crowley advises that asking is the magic word, and that one should not assume, as the words that a person uses might change. All of us, transgender and cisgender, can use language to understand ourselves and to respect those around us, and we can creatively use language to build the identities and relationships that bring us joy.
