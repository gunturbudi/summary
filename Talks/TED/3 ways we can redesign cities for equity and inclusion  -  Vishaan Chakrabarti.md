# Summary of 3 ways we can redesign cities for equity and inclusion | Vishaan Chakrabarti

Urban designer and architect Vishaan Chakrabarti proposes a new urban equity agenda focused on three core components: equitable health and housing, sustainable urban mobility, and attainable social and cultural resources. He suggests repurposing old office buildings and brownfield sites to create affordable housing for essential workers, as well as rethinking the use of road space to prioritize public transit, biking, and walking. Chakrabarti also discusses the potential for creating educational and social infrastructure in empty storefronts, as well as a “village living” model tailored to different cultures and societies. He believes that without diverse representation in government and a rethinking of traditional narratives, an urban equity agenda will not be possible, and hopes to promote inclusion in the industry through his upcoming role as the dean of an architecture school.

In this section, urban designer and architect Vishaan Chakrabarti discusses the need for a new narrative and social contract around cities in the wake of the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement. He suggests focusing on three components for a new urban equity agenda: equitable health and housing, sustainable urban mobility, and attainable social and cultural resources. Chakrabarti acknowledges the challenges of affordable housing in major urban centers, particularly for essential workers, and stresses the importance of resetting the balance to ensure they can live closer to their jobs. He proposes policy solutions to address the interrelated issues of housing and health, mobility, and social and cultural resources.

In this section, Vishaan Chakrabarti discusses how cities should approach housing policy with both equity and attainability in mind. He suggests that old office buildings may be converted into affordable housing for essential workers, especially if remote working becomes more prevalent. He also points out that many cities have brownfield sites and railyards that can be used for mixed-income attainable housing. Chakrabarti acknowledges that building this infrastructure will require a large budget allocation, but argues that the wealthy cities of the world can afford it, and suggests that we may need to borrow and use debt to build the infrastructure of opportunity. The conversation then moves on to transportation, with concerns being raised about the possible rise in private car usage due to fears around public transit use during the pandemic.

In this section, Vishaan Chakrabarti discusses the importance of rethinking the use of road space in cities and how it can lead to a more efficient and equitable transportation system. He suggests using more public space for express buses, walking, and biking while reducing the amount of space dedicated to private cars. Chakrabarti argues that this spatial problem is not limited to technological advancements and can be solved by giving more streets over to people as opposed to cars. He believes that focusing on what communities need, including in terms of public housing that works for them, is crucial in building a more equitable urban environment. Chakrabarti also highlights the current opportunity to leverage the emptiness in cities to prioritize low-carbon and healthy public spaces, as a move towards a better urban transportation system.

In this section, Vishaan Chakrabarti discusses the prospect of redesigning transportation in urban areas to prioritize low-emission modes like biking, walking, and accessible public transit. Chakrabarti also suggests repurposing empty storefronts in urban areas for educational and social infrastructure to create a cradle-to-grave educational system accessible to everyone in the community. He discusses the possibility of creating a “village living” model that reflects the need for humans to live in collectives and could be tailored to different cultures and societies worldwide. Chakrabarti believes that creating vibrant, socially supportive neighborhoods at all scales is possible, even in a world with fewer chain stores.

In this section, architect Vishaan Chakrabarti discusses the potential for changes in office life post-pandemic. While he acknowledges that some employees may want to continue working remotely, he believes that many industries still require face-to-face interaction for innovation and creativity. Chakrabarti also notes that history has shown how pandemics have changed the form of cities, including infrastructure and building standards, but that these changes present an opportunity to redesign cities for equity and inclusion. However, he cautions that without diverse representation in government and a rethinking of traditional narratives, an urban equity agenda will not be possible. As the incoming dean of an architecture school, Chakrabarti hopes to diversify faculty and pedagogy in order to train future leaders and promote inclusion in the industry.

In this section, a speaker highlights the importance of universities like Berkeley in producing urban planners, landscape architects, and architects who can change the narrative and implement policies that are sustainable, equitable, and attainable. The speaker notes that there is much to do in terms of listening to communities and working with them, and mentions Walter Foote as an example of someone who has been doing this for decades. As we look at everything through the frame of equity, sustainability, and attainability, the speaker believes that pedagogy will change in the architecture fields.
