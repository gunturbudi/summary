# Summary of How we could teach our bodies to heal faster | Kaitlyn Sadtler

In a video titled "How we could teach our bodies to heal faster," Kaitlyn Sadtler shares her research on instructing the immune system to regenerate tissues and heal wounds more quickly. She found that immune cells can be trained to rush towards an injury, and helper T cells are crucial for wound healing. Her team is creating materials that instruct the immune system to build new tissues, which could lead to scar-proof band-aids, muscle fillers, and wound-healing vaccines, potentially regenerating body parts without scars.

In this section, Kaitlyn Sadtler explains her research on how the immune system can be instructed to regenerate tissues and help heal wounds more quickly. Her team discovered that immune cells could be trained to rush towards an injury instead of an infection, and the presence of helper T cells is crucial for wound healing. She is working on creating materials that instruct the immune system to build new tissues, as the immune environment of a scaffold affects the way stem cells reproduce and develop. In the future, this research could lead to products like scar-proof band-aids, moldable muscle fillers, and wound-healing vaccines, creating the possibility of regenerating body parts without scars.
