# Summary of Michael Sandel: The lost art of democratic debate

Michael Sandel argues for the need to engage in democratic debates that involve meaningful discussion and open-mindedness around big moral questions. Using examples such as the debate over allowing a professional golfer with a disability to use a golf cart and the debate over same-sex marriage, Sandel emphasizes the importance of interrogating the underlying moral assumptions that inform our arguments. He suggests that a global classroom could promote civic and democratic engagement on these issues to improve political discourse.

In this section, Michael Sandel discusses the need for a better way of conducting political debates that involve fewer shouting matches and more discussion around the big questions of moral philosophy and justice. Using the example of Aristotle's theory of justice, Sandel explains that just distribution of something requires an understanding of the essential nature of the activity in question and the qualities worth honoring and recognizing. While the example of flutes might seem trivial, it highlights the importance of interrogating and debating the underlying moral assumptions that inform our arguments on pressing issues such as health care, Wall Street, income inequality, and affirmative action.

In this section, Michael Sandel uses the example of a debate over golf to illustrate the lost art of democratic debate. The debate centered around whether Casey Martin, a golfer with a disability, should be allowed to use a golf cart in PGA tournaments. Those who argued against allowing the golf cart believed it would give Martin an unfair advantage, while those in favor argued that walking the course was not an essential part of golf, and that the fatigue factor was already accounted for in handicap scoring. This example highlights how debates should involve meaningful discussion and open-mindedness, rather than simply sticking to one's initial opinion.

In this section, Michael Sandel discusses the debate over whether or not professional golfer Casey Martin should be allowed to use a golf cart. Justices disagreed on the essential nature of golf and what abilities are worthy of honor and recognition as athletic talents. While Scalia rejected the idea of being able to determine the essential nature of a game, Sandel argues that figuring out what qualities and excellences are worthy of recognition in a particular activity is crucial to determining what justice requires. The debate over same-sex marriage is another example where grappling with the essential nature of an institution is essential.

In this section, Michael Sandel discusses the underlying ways of thinking about justice and morality that are present in debates over social institutions such as same-sex marriage. He suggests that these debates shed light on the way political discourse can be improved and elevated by engaging directly with the moral convictions that citizens bring to public life, rather than ignoring them. Sandel's vision for the next phase of education involves promoting civic and democratic debate on big moral questions through a global classroom that connects students in different parts of the world.
