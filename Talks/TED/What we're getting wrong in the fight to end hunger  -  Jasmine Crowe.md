In this section, a volunteer at a local food pantry was surprised to find out that they were not giving real meals to the families in need, but essentially only packaged food which contained a lot of junk food. The speaker argues that this approach to hunger is wrong because it creates a dependency cycle and the food given is often not well-balanced. Moreover, despite all the charity work, millions of people are still food insecure. The US wastes over 80 billion pounds of food, more than ever before, while nearly 40 million people in the US experience hunger every year, including more than 11 million children that go to bed hungry every night.

In this section, Jasmine Crowe explains that while social entrepreneurs have the potential to make a significant difference in tackling issues such as hunger, they don't receive the same support as national hunger-fighting organizations and food banks. She discusses the importance of connecting businesses with surplus food to people in need, and the impact that access to food can have on improving health outcomes and reducing food waste. Crowe encourages changing laws and policies, shifting our attitudes towards food drives and food banks, and working towards solving hunger to improve the lives of millions of people.
