# Summary of Marco Annunziata: Welcome to the age of the industrial internet

In this video, Marco Annunziata discusses the Industrial Internet, which combines intelligent machines, advanced analytics, and human creativity. This concept is allowing machines to become brilliant and communicate seamlessly with each other and with us. Annunziata gives examples of how the industrial internet is already being used in the aviation industry with self-learning preventive maintenance systems. The industrial internet has the potential to raise average income by 25-40% over the next 15 years in the US, but it will require significant investments in new technologies, cybersecurity, education, and the adaptation of organizations and managerial practices. Despite these challenges, Annunziata is optimistic about the future and its potential to create growth and a better world for everyone.

In this section, Marco Annunziata discusses the industrial Internet - bringing together intelligent machines, advanced analytics, and the creativity of people at work. He explains how electronic sensors are allowing machines to see, hear and feel more than ever before, generating data which analytics can sift through to find insights that allow us to operate machines in new, more efficient ways. This concept is allowing us to move to a world where machines aren't just intelligent, but brilliant, communicating seamlessly with each other and with us. This transformation could be as powerful as the Industrial Revolution, and examples of how the industrial Internet is already being used in the aviation industry are discussed, where self-learning preventive maintenance systems are able to predict issues, leading to a significant cost and time-saving.

In this section, we learn about how the industrial internet is transforming different industries, such as aviation, healthcare and energy. By using technology to monitor and connect equipment and people, we could improve health outcomes, yield substantial economic benefits and create new jobs. Despite fears that innovation will destroy jobs and only cater to highly specialized workers, new industrial applications will make life easier for workers of all skill levels. The worker of the future will be more like Iron Man than Charlie Chaplin, and new high-skilled jobs will be created. Overall, the industrial internet has potential to create growth and create a better world for everyone.

In this section, Marco Annunziata argues that there is a new wave of innovation that is beginning to sweep through the industrial sector, which could have significant economic benefits. The Industrial Internet has the potential to raise average income by 25-40% over the next 15 years in the US, boosting growth and adding trillions of dollars to global GDP. However, this transformation will not be easy and will require significant investments in new technologies, cybersecurity, education, and the adaptation of organizations and managerial practices. Despite these challenges, Annunziata is enthusiastic about the future and the difference that human-machine interconnectivity can make in industries such as healthcare, transportation, and power generation.
