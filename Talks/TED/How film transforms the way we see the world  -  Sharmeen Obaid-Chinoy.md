Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy's Academy Award-nominated documentary, "A Girl in the River: The Price of Forgiveness," tells the story of a young woman, named Saba, who is forced to marry a man she does not love in order to protect her family from an honor killing. When the law is changed to protect women from such killings, Saba and others work to bring the film and its message to the heartland of Pakistan, where resistance to change is strong. Despite the challenges, the film's impact is evident in the closure of a legal loophole that allowed honor killings to continue.
