# Summary of The surprising way groups like ISIS stay in power | Benedetta Berti

Benedetta Berti explains in her video that non-state armed groups in the Middle East rely not only on violence but also non-violent activities to increase their strength, recruit better, build their brand, and fill the gap left by governance. Governments should invest more in non-military tools, fill that governance gap, and build stronger relationships with the population. Military power can win battles, but a long-term investment in filling security and governance gaps is necessary to achieve lasting peace and stability.

In this section, Benedetta Berti explains that to understand non-state armed groups in the Middle East, we need to know what makes these organizations tick. While these groups are known for their violence, non-violent activities are also part of their functioning. By filling the gap left by governance, these groups increase their strength, recruit better, build their brand, and serve their purpose. Governments should, therefore, invest more in non-military tools, fill that governance gap, and build stronger relationships with the population. These non-state actors are complex and sophisticated, and the more states are weak, the more they will fill that gap.

In this section, Benedetta Berti argues that a better understanding of armed groups can lead to more effective strategies for encouraging transition from violence to nonviolence. While military power can win battles, it is not enough to achieve lasting peace and stability. Rather, a long-term investment in filling security and governance gaps that allowed these groups to thrive is necessary.
