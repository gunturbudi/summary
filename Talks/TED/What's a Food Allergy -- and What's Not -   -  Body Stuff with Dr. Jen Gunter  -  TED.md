# Summary of What's a Food Allergy -- and What's Not? | Body Stuff with Dr. Jen Gunter | TED

Dr. Jen Gunter explains the differences between food allergies and food intolerances. Food allergies occur when the immune system responds to specific proteins in certain foods, while food intolerances are usually related to our body's inability to digest certain foods. Allergic reactions can be mild or severe and occur quickly after eating or exposure to the food, while intolerances can often result in digestive issues and show up in the next few days. It's crucial to seek a proper diagnosis from a doctor and an allergist is the go-to person for diagnosing and treating food allergies.
