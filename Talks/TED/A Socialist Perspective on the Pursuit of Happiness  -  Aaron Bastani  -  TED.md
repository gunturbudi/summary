Aaron Bastani discusses the idea of "fully automated luxury communism," or a system where labor is reduced to a minimum and all citizens enjoy basic services free of charge. He argues that this is a preferable system to the current one, which is characterized by inequality, climate change, and population aging. He proposes a universal basic income as a way to pay for these services.

Aaron Bastani argues that the pursuit of happiness should be at the center of society, and that the biggest resistance to this is the housing market. He suggests that public healthcare should be a priority, and that the United States and the United Kingdom are spending too much on private healthcare when there are better options available. He also argues that aging populations and a lack of birth replacement rates will create a need for universal basic services, and that if this doesn't happen, UBS care will not be affordable.
