# Summary of The surprising science of alpha males | Frans de Waal

Frans de Waal discusses the true meaning of the term "alpha male" in this video and how it is often mischaracterized as a bully. He explains that every primate group has one alpha male and one alpha female, and that the highest ranking male is the alpha male. De Waal shows examples of chimpanzee body language, such as the bipedal swagger, that demonstrate the alpha male's dominance. He also notes that old males can still be influential and have a significant impact on the hierarchy, such as making a younger male the alpha. The biggest privilege of being an alpha male is having access to females, but it comes with costs such as constantly watching one's back and disrupting the coalitions of others. De Waal argues that the label "alpha male" should not be used to describe men who are simply bullies, as this term encompasses more positive qualities.

Alpha males are impartial in controlling fights and go up for the underdog in general, providing security for the lowest-ranking members of the group. They also show empathy and provide comfort in the group, becoming extremely popular leaders. Alpha females like Mama, the alpha female in the Arnhem zoo, play an equally important role in holding the group together. The bonobos have a matriarchal society where the alpha individual is generally a female.
