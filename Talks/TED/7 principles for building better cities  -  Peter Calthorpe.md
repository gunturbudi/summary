Cities are a manifestation of the kind of humanity we bring to bear, and getting it right can help solve climate change. The problem isn't free-floating, and it's not just ExxonMobil and oil companies. It's us; how we live. There's a villain in this story, called sprawl. Sprawl happens anywhere, at any density, and the key attribute is that it isolates people. The antidote to sprawl is what we all need to be thinking about when we're taking on this massive construction project.

In order to improve the livability of cities and reduce the costs of living, Peter Calthorpe discusses the principles of transit-oriented development (TOD), community, small blocks, mixed use, and geographic equity in circulation systems. TOD is a less expensive and more dense form of urban sprawl that is better suited for the average middle-class family.

Peter Calthorpe shares seven principles for building better cities that are universally applicable. One is to preserve the natural environment, the history, and the critical agriculture. Second is to mix uses of the city so that different groups of people are able to live in close proximity and mix their age groups and land uses. Third is to make use of the most efficient transportation methods, which include walking, biking, and transit. Fourth is to share autonomous vehicles in order to reduce traffic congestion. Fifth is to focus on the needs of residents over the needs of transportation companies, and sixth is to be mindful of the negative impacts of self-driving cars. Calthorpe encourages residents to embrace urban planning principles such as connect and ride that will result in better cities for all.
