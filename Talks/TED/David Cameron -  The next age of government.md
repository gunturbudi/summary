In this section of the transcript, David Cameron discusses the important fact to bear in mind in British politics: the country has vast budget deficits and has run out of money. As a result, the question in politics at the moment is "how do we make things better without spending more money?" Cameron believes that if politicians think success in public services can only be measured by spending more money, then they will have a miserable time. Instead, politicians should believe that things like family relationships, friendship, community, and values matter that lead up to well-being. By combining the right political philosophy with the incredible information revolution that has taken place, Cameron believes there is an incredible opportunity to remake politics, government, and public services to achieve a big increase in the country's well-being.

In this section, David Cameron discusses the three chief ways that the information revolution can bring change and improvement to our government, public services, and politics. Firstly, transparency, where public access to government spending and contracts can lead to competition and better value for money. Secondly, greater choice, where searchable health sites and crime maps are two examples of how citizens can gain information and hold their service providers accountable. Finally, accountability, where complete transparency and people power can lead to more well-being, efficiency, and trust in our government and public services.

In this section, David Cameron discusses a revolution in understanding human behavior and an opportunity to utilize this knowledge to achieve more. He explains how it is easier to achieve positive changes in behavior by working with the grain of human nature, using behavioral economics and paying people to recycle or showing them what their neighbors are doing as a way to motivate them to be more energy-efficient. He then reads an excerpt from Robert Kennedy's speech, where he argues that Gross National Product doesn't capture the things that make life worthwhile. David Cameron believes that we are now closer to achieving Robert Kennedy's dream with the advances in technology, changes in behavioral economics, and understanding human behavior.
