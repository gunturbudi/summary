# Summary of Why we think it's OK to cheat and steal (sometimes) | Dan Ariely

Dan Ariely conducted several experiments to understand why people cheat and steal. He found that people tend to cheat just a little bit, and this "personal fudge factor" allows them to still feel good about themselves. However, he also found that reminding people of moral codes can decrease cheating. Ariely suggests that creating distance from money, such as through stock markets, increases cheating. He argues that our intuitions can prevent us from objectively evaluating our beliefs and ideas, and that systematic experimentation is needed to improve.

In this section, Dan Ariely discusses his interest in irrational behavior and how it stemmed from his experience as a burn victim who suffered from the nurses' irrational approach to removing bandages. He then conducted experiments on pain and discovered that predictably, people make mistakes in their decisions, including those with good intentions and plenty of experience. Ariely then shares his interest in cheating and how he conducted an experiment to understand if it is an endemic situation or if it's limited to a few individuals. Through his experiments, Ariely discovered that people tend to cheat a little bit and that it's a predictable irrationality.

In this section, Dan Ariely talks about his experiments testing why people cheat and steal. He conducted an experiment where he would pay people for solving simple math problems, and found that when he tempted people to cheat, they cheated more, even when the economic incentives didn't change much. Ariely then talks about a "personal fudge factor," which is the idea that we can cheat a little bit and still feel good about ourselves. To test this theory, he had people recall The Ten Commandments or sign an honor code before being tempted to cheat, and found that people cheated less after doing so. He also found that increasing the fudge factor by using tokens instead of real money made people cheat even more.

In this section, Dan Ariely describes several experiments that he conducted to understand why people cheat and steal. One experiment involved paying students with tokens instead of cash, which led to an increase in cheating. Another involved an actor cheating to see what impact it would have on the group, which showed that people cheat more when those from their in-group cheat. Ariely also suggests that creating distance from money, such as through stock markets, increases the likelihood of cheating. He concludes that many of our intuitions are wrong and that testing them is crucial when making policy decisions.

In this section, Dan Ariely explains how our strong intuitions can prevent us from objectively evaluating our own beliefs and ideas. He uses an example of a nurse who was hesitant to participate in an experiment that went against her intuition, even though it could have improved her job performance. Ariely argues that we must challenge our intuitions by conducting systematic experimentation in order to improve. He emphasizes the importance of being open to the possibility that our intuitions may be wrong and the benefits of testing them in order to do better.
