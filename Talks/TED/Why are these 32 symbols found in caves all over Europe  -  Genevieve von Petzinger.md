# Summary of Why are these 32 symbols found in caves all over Europe | Genevieve von Petzinger

This video discusses the theory that the geometric signs found on cave walls throughout Europe were not abstract written characters, but instead symbols used to represent words that were missing from the language at that time. New evidence has come to light that supports this theory, and the author suggests that it is time to revisit it.

This 1-minute video clip introduces the topic of cave art, illustrating how it developed from spoken and gestural communication to graphic communication, which was more durable and able to be transmitted and preserved. Europe is one of the earliest places where graphic communication is commonly found, and the Ice Age was a time of great creativity.

The video discusses the 32 geometric signs found throughout Europe, which are thought to have been created between 30,000 and 40,000 years ago. Most of the signs are similar in both space and time, suggesting that they may have been created by a single originator. The video also discusses the similarities between European rock art and art from other parts of the world, suggesting that the geometric signs may be one of the oldest systems of graphic communication in the world.
