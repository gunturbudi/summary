In this section, Andy Dunn shares about his experience of having a manic episode and being falsely convinced that he was the Messiah. He highlights the similarities between the symptoms associated with bipolar disorder and the qualities commonly associated with entrepreneurs, including high-risk behavior and grandiosity. He goes on to talk about his experience as the cofounder of Bonobos, an e-commerce company dedicated to selling pants, and how it was once thought to be a crazy idea by venture capitalists, but ultimately succeeded. Dunn also discusses the downside of entrepreneurship, which obscured his bipolar disorder and ultimately led him to experience mood swings.

In this section, the speaker describes his experience with hypomania and depression, which are part of bipolar disorder. He explains that during hypomania, he was extremely creative and productive, but also suffered from depressive episodes that lasted for days or months and left him unable to work or even get out of bed. Andy Dunn's bipolar disorder was worsened by various work-related issues, including a cofounder divorce, executive changes, and cash flow problems. In 2016, he had a manic episode where he believed he was the president and Batman, and he physically harmed his wife and mother-in-law while attempting to flee naked into the streets. After the incident, his mother-in-law told him that getting treatment for his condition was similar to treating a chronic physical illness, and that Manuela, his wife, would stay with him if he followed a treatment plan. Andy now has an "Olympic regimen" of mental hygiene and fitness that includes seeing a psychiatrist two to three times per week, taking medication, and focusing on sleep.
