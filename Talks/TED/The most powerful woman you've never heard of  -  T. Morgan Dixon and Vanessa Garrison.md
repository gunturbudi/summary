# Summary of The most powerful woman you've never heard of | T. Morgan Dixon and Vanessa Garrison

In a TED Talk, T. Morgan Dixon and Vanessa Garrison honor the legacy of Septima Clark, a civil rights leader who used Citizenship Schools to teach women practical skills to read and vote. The pair discuss their organization, GirlTrek, which encourages Black women to establish a culture of health and empowerment in their communities. The speakers propose starting a new iteration of Citizenship Schools, dubbed "Summer of Selma," to train 10,000 frontline health activists to tackle the crisis of Black women dying at higher rates than any other group in the US. They discuss their 100-mile journey on the Underground Railroad and how it drove over three million viewers to their cause. Finally, Dixon and Garrison speak about their vision to inspire change in their communities and to provide an example of human flourishing.

In this section, T. Morgan Dixon and Vanessa Garrison explain their plan to create a new Citizenship School akin to the civil rights movement teach-ins, called "Summer of Selma," and the audacious goal of training 10,000 frontline health activists to deploy in America's neediest communities. They highlight the urgency for this plan by discussing how Black women are dying at higher and faster rates than any other group in the country, and this crisis is caused by the same injustice that first propelled the civil rights movement. Dixon and Garrison mention their successful 100-mile journey on the actual Underground Railroad, which garnered over three million viewers, and talk about the impact their team could have on communities once they train one million Black women to walk to save their own lives.

They speak about the mission of GirlTrek to launch the largest health revolution the country has ever seen and to model the best of human flourishing to their communities. They aim to continue the work of Septima Clark until Black women are no longer dying and everyone can breathe the air together.
