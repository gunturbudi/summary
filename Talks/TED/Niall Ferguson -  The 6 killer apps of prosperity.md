# Summary of Niall Ferguson: The 6 killer apps of prosperity

In this video, historian Niall Ferguson presents the idea of the Great Divergence, where Western countries' wealth has significantly surpassed the rest of the world since the 1800s. He argues that imperialism alone cannot explain this phenomenon, but rather six "killer apps" - competition, science, property rights, modern medicine, the consumer society, and the work ethic. Ferguson warns of the dangers of sequencing these apps incorrectly and suggests that China may struggle without private property rights. He concludes that these apps are losing their edge in the West and marks a historic shift in the global balance of power.

In this section, Niall Ferguson discusses the Great Divergence, the exponential increase in wealth for Western countries compared to the rest of the world since the 1800s. He presents a chart of per capita GDP ratios over time, showing that the British and Americans surpassed Indians and Chinese in income by the 1970s. However, he argues that imperialism alone cannot explain this phenomena as it was a common tactic used by many civilizations throughout history. Samuel Johnson and other historical figures also questioned how the European nations became so powerful, while the Resterners, such as Ottoman official Ibrahim Muteferrika, were looking for answers to this dilemma at the same time.

In this section, Niall Ferguson explains that the Great Divergence between the West and the rest cannot be explained by geography or national character, as demonstrated by natural experiments with Germany and Korea. The answer, according to Ferguson, lies in institutions, or what he calls "killer apps" - competition, the scientific revolution, property rights, modern medicine, the consumer society, and the work ethic. These six apps set the West apart from the rest, allowing for economic and technological advancement that was not possible in other parts of the world. Ferguson emphasizes that these seemingly simple apps are underpinned by complex institutions that allowed for social and economic development.

In this section, Ferguson discusses the six killer apps of prosperity: competition, science, property rights, medicine, a consumer society, and a strong work ethic. These "killer apps" were essential in making the Western world so prosperous, and they can be downloaded and implemented in any society to achieve the same level of success - it has already happened with many countries in East Asia. However, there is a risk that these apps could be deleted or forgotten in the Western world. Furthermore, there is a question of whether the sequencing of the download matters, meaning that some apps need to be downloaded before others in order to be effective.

In this section, Niall Ferguson discusses the six killer apps of prosperity and warns of the dangers of sequencing them incorrectly. He emphasizes the importance of private property rights for a successful transition to democracy and suggests that China may struggle without this key app. Ferguson believes that the decline of Western civilization is not inevitable but warns that complex civilizations operate on the edge of chaos and can collapse suddenly. He notes that Latin America is part of the "Rest" that is experiencing prosperity and economic growth, but laments the fact that North America and Europe are not paying attention to these trends, instead only worrying about each other's fiscal crises.

In this section, Niall Ferguson concludes that the major causes of Western ascendancy were its six "killer apps": competition, science, property rights, modern medicine, the consumer society, and the work ethic. He believes that these apps are losing their edge in the West, and will soon be overtaken by other nations. The COVID-19 pandemic has also accelerated this shift, as Western nations have struggled to control the spread of the virus and maintain their economies, while nations like China have been able to quickly recover. Ferguson believes that this is the beginning of the end of Western ascendancy, which lasted for half a millennium, and marks a historic shift in the global balance of power.
