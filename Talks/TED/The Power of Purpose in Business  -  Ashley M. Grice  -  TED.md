In this section, Ashley M. Grice discusses the importance of ensuring authenticity in company purpose and the discomfort that can arise in defining and implementing that purpose, particularly for companies undergoing significant change or grappling with bad behaviors. Grice emphasizes that purpose must apply to the whole of the organization, from the C-suite to the front-line employees, in order to be effective in motivating and unifying the company towards concrete goals and values. By embedding purpose consistently across culture, strategy, and brand over time, Grice argues that purpose can become muscle memory, creating a norm of loyalty and customer advocacy that transcends individual employees or leaders.
