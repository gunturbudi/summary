# Summary of How Do We Get the World Off Fossil Fuels Quickly and Fairly? | TED Countdown Dilemma Series

The urgent need to phase out fossil fuels is agreed upon by experts and activists, but the pathway to achieving this equitably is complex. The questions of whether to stop fossil fuel exploration and production entirely, where to do so, and how to scale renewables and pay for them are all incredibly complex. The need to create a continent-sized grid is emphasized for a more reliable, low-cost, and low-carbon emission grid for efficient power transmission from renewable energy sources to the areas where energy demand is highest. Experts believe there must be a combination of personal and political action, dialogue, and collaboration to meet energy transition goals. Investing in the clean energy infrastructure of low-income countries is critical to create a fair transition, and banks can play a critical role in financing the transition by directing capital generated from the oil and gas industry to renewable projects.

In this section, experts and activists agree that the phasing out of fossil fuels is necessary and urgent, but the pathway to achieving this equitably is complex. The questions of whether to stop fossil fuel exploration and production entirely, or to encourage it for certain communities, where to do so, how to actually scale renewables and pay for it all, are all incredibly complex. Eliminating fossil fuels and ensuring that everyone benefits is what needs to be achieved. The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated in 2018 that if we are to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, we cannot emit more than 500 gigatons of CO2 between 2020 and 2050, and we've only got 420 gigatons left. Renewable energy is now a cheaper way to produce electricity than coal in almost all countries of the world, and so experts recommend building no more coal electricity plants.

In this section, the speakers discuss the need to move away from fossil fuels and reduce their demand to meet big reduction targets. While some argue that a little bit of fossil fuel use might be necessary for the developing world, there is still a need to have an all-in understanding of the energy system and concentrate the fossil fuel supply and demand on the absolute necessary means and usage. Some believe that working with the fossil fuel industry and pivoting towards a clean future is possible, while others are more skeptical, arguing that the industry lacks the urgency of now and there is little time left for a long, transition-y kind of discourse.

In this section, Luisa Neubauer, a well-known climate activist, points out the deception of the fossil fuel industry and urges people not to believe their promises of transition and green growth. She argues that the climate crisis is not manmade but rather fossil fuel-made, with a relatively small group of people and places responsible for it. On the other hand, economist Vijaya Ramachandran believes in the necessity of energy for poverty reduction and climate adaptation in developing countries. Ramachandran argues that rather than limiting energy use in these countries, they need more energy from low-carbon sources like wind and solar to adapt to climate change effectively.

In this section, the focus is on the need for the US and Europe to be smarter about ending energy poverty and addressing climate change, starting with ending the rich-world hypocrisy of enjoying more fossil fuels but not for poor countries. To fuel the energy transition in poor countries, renewables will be the lion's share, but some fossil fuels such as natural gas and other low-carbon energy sources will be in the mix. No country has developed without fossil fuels, and the US has a practical approach to funding energy projects that rich countries should emulate. The need for financing clean energy in Africa is also emphasized since the financial flows to deliver bountiful clean energy remain scanty. Even though Africa accounts for almost 90% of those without access to basic energy, it only receives 2% of the global clean-energy finance. The key missing ingredient is international cooperation to deliver the finance flows that Africa needs.

In this section, experts discuss the importance of financing and planning in the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy. They emphasize that low-income countries need investment in their clean energy infrastructure to make the transition appear fair. Banks can play a critical role in financing the transition by directing capital generated from the oil and gas industry to renewable projects. Meanwhile, planning is crucial to ensure that the phasing out of the fossil fuel infrastructure happens safely without disrupting underserved communities. They highlight the need to set deadlines for fossil asset retirements to give communities enough time to adjust to the new system.

00:25:00
In this section, the importance of creating and implementing plans with a legislated end date to build trust and confidence towards the transition away from fossil fuels is emphasized. Manish Bhardwaj highlights the significance of plans and commitment to building trust when working towards a sustainable future. Ramez Naam believes that the plummeting cost of clean energy is a sign of a successful transition, but challenges with permitting and reluctance to build in certain areas must be addressed. The need to create a continent-sized grid is emphasized for a more reliable, low-cost, and low-carbon emission grid.

00:30:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the potential for a modern grid that could transmit power efficiently from renewable energy sources to the areas where energy demand is highest. He gives an example of a 3,400-kilometer-long line that is 90% efficient, resulting in just a penny or two added to the cost of electricity. This type of grid would allow electricity to be transmitted from sunny areas like New Mexico to land-dense cities like New York and bring wind power from less populated areas in the Great Plains to coastal areas in winter. Despite this potential, the world is not building this type of grid. However, experts believe there is hope for meeting energy transition goals with a combination of personal and political action, dialogue, and collaboration.
