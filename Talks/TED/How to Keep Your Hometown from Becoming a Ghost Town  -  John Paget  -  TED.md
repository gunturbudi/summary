He emphasizes the importance of knowing a community's story and heritage, and how it can infuse its people with confidence and resilience, using examples such as Seligman and Tenino.

In this section, the speaker discusses how ghost towns come into existence gradually as a result of slow-motion disasters such as urban sprawl, or sudden disasters such as wildfires and earthquakes. He explains how the COVID-19 pandemic has also turned cities into temporary ghost towns, leaving communities grappling with economic devastation. However, he asserts that building community resilience, developing civic pride, and crafting a strong identity for communities can give them the determination to survive and rebuild even in ruins. The speaker shares how the power of the civic story can change a city and gives an example of a tiny town in northern Arizona called Seligman, whose inhabitants turned it from a ghost town to an important landmark by embracing their heritage and making the stretch from Williams through Seligman to Kingman an official historic Route 66 Highway.

In this section, the importance of knowing a community's story and heritage is emphasized, as it infuses its people with confidence, grit, and resilience. Those who know their history are better equipped to face challenges and find ways to move forward. Examples of such communities include Seligman, whose story about the Route 66 inspired dozens of towns; and Tenino, whose connection to its past allowed it to weather the Great Depression and the recent economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Tenino's printing press, which was once used to create wooden dollars during the Great Depression to sustain the town's economy, was reactivated to print $25 COVID relief funds, which has not only helped residents but also encouraged them to spend locally, supporting Tenino's small businesses.

In this section, the speaker discusses the power of narrative when it comes to the survival of a city. Often, cities get stuck in negative and cynical narratives that make their residents feel defeated. The speaker has made several short films about Buffalo, his hometown, that have helped change the conversation about the city by highlighting its rich urban design history and how it is being embraced by a new generation committed to restoring it. He believes that a well-told civic story can rekindle love for a place and its residents' pride in it, and suggests that everyone can play a role in telling their city's story through various mediums.

In this section, John Paget emphasizes the significance of local business in preserving the history and character of a town. He suggests that residents should support and appreciate these businesses as they offer unique and authentic experiences to customers while also telling a story about the town's past and future. By doing so, the residents themselves become a part of the town's evolution and help prevent it from becoming a ghost town.
