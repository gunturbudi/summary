This video discusses the cultures at the far edge of the world, and how they are being displaced by external forces. Wade Davis discusses how the Neolithic Revolution – which gave us agriculture and hierarchy – is only 10,000 years old, and how the modern industrial world is barely 300 years old. He notes that when these myriad cultures are asked the meaning of being human, they respond with 10,000 different voices. Davis concludes that it is within this song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are: a fully conscious species, fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish.
