# Summary of The Fantastically Weird World of Photosynthetic Sea Slugs | Michael Middlebrooks | TED

Michael Middlebrooks discusses photosynthesis and its significance in the biological energy process of most animals on the planet, while also highlighting unique animals such as sea sponges, corals, flatworms, jellyfish, and some mollusks that have become photosynthetic themselves. He talks about gastropods, which are slugs and snails, and shows the audience pictures of a few slugs he has encountered, highlighting how "fantastically weird, beautiful, and do some very strange things." Michael explains how the slugs are herbivores and have the ability to steal photosynthesis from the algae they eat, a behavior still not fully understood, with research ongoing.

In this section, the speaker discusses the concept of photosynthesis and its significance in the biological energy process of most animals on the planet. However, there are some unique animals such as corals, sea sponges, flatworms, jellyfish, and some mollusks that have become photosynthetic themselves, which allows them to capture the energy from the sun and convert it into biological energy. The speaker showcases the example of the giant clam, a photosynthetic mollusk found in the tropical coral reefs of the Indo-Pacific, as well as the upside-down jellyfish, which can survive mainly on sunlight rather than traditional forms of animal nutrition.

In this section, the speaker talks about gastropods, which are slugs and snails, and explains that slugs are just snails that have lost their shells through evolution. The speaker shares that he is most interested in slugs and shows the audience pictures of a few of the slugs he has encountered, explaining that they are fantastically weird, beautiful and do some very strange things. The speaker goes on to talk about two groups of slugs, the nudibranchs, and the sacoglossan sea slugs, with the latter being his favorite. He explains that these slugs are herbivores and steal photosynthesis from the algae they eat.

In this section, Michael Middlebrooks discusses how photosynthetic sea slugs have the ability to make chlorophyll, something which animals are not supposed to be capable of doing. This amazing feat is still not fully understood, and research is ongoing to unravel the cellular, molecular, and biochemical processes that enable this behavior. Additionally, there are many more questions to be answered, such as why some of these slugs are blue in color. However, Middlebrooks hopes that this introduction to sea slugs will inspire curiosity and a desire to learn more about these fascinating creatures.
