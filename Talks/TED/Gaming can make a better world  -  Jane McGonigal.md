In this section of the video, game designer Jane McGonigal argues that gaming can help solve urgent global problems, such as climate change, poverty and hunger. She notes that we currently spend three billion hours playing online games each week, which she asserts is not enough to sufficiently address the world's challenges. McGonigal argues that by increasing our gameplay to 21 billion hours a week, we can generate mass problem-solvers who approach challenges with the same optimism, focus and determination demonstrated in the gaming world. She notes that gaming brings out the best versions of ourselves, making us more motivated to achieve goals and inspired to cooperate and collaborate. As such, we can take the positive feelings engendered by gaming into the real world and more effectively tackle its issues.

In this section of her speech, game designer Jane McGonigal talks about how playing games can be motivational and ultimately beneficial to one's character. One point she emphasizes is the level of collaboration that gaming promotes - in games, no unemployment exists and there is always something important to be done, all while working with hundreds of thousands of collaborators around the world. Gamers become experts in what they do and have an extraordinary amount of motivation to accomplish their goals. McGonigal argues that the amount of time being spent on games, collectively millions of years worth, is how much time we have committed to practically evolving our species to become better collaborators and workers.

In this section of the talk, Jane McGonigal explains that gamers possess four superpowers which include urgent optimism, social fabric, blissful productivity, and epic meaning; they are super-empowered and hopeful individuals that believe they can change the world. Gamers are invested in virtual worlds because they can achieve more in those worlds than in real life, and they can have stronger social relationships and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life. To make the real world more optimal, McGonigal suggests that the world should start functioning more like a game. She tells the story of the ancient Kingdom Of Lydia, which survived a famine by playing games and embracing an epic adventure, and suggests that we can save civilization by using games.

In this section, game designer Jane McGonigal discusses how gaming can be used to solve real-world problems. She shares three games that she has created in an attempt to give people the means to create "epic wins" in their own futures. These games include World Without Oil, an online game in which players try to survive an oil shortage; Superstruct, a game in which everyone is on the dream team to save the world; and a game created in partnership with the World Bank Institute that certifies players as social innovators. McGonigal believes gamers are a human resource that can be harnessed to do real-world work and that games are a powerful platform for change.
