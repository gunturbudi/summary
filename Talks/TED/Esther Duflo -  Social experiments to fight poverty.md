# Summary of Esther Duflo: Social experiments to fight poverty

Esther Duflo presents the concept of using randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effectiveness of poverty-alleviating interventions, in the same way that they have been used in medicine. She provides examples of successful RCTs being done in developing countries such as increasing immunization rates in Rajasthan and distributing bed nets in Kenya. Duflo emphasizes that social policy needs to be approached scientifically through experimentation and fine-tuning to determine the most effective and efficient approach to achieve policy goals. She believes that poverty is mostly invisible, complex, and requires multiple interventions for sustainable solutions. Duflo highlights the power of evidence-based action and continual experimentation to create a better global future.

In this section, the speaker discusses the issue of aid and poverty and presents a thought experiment to the audience. She highlights the need for intervention and aid to alleviate poverty in developing countries, but also emphasizes the difficulty in measuring the effectiveness of aid. She then asks a series of important questions about specific improvements like immunizations, bed nets, and education that can be difficult to execute effectively in poverty-stricken areas. The main point of the talk is about using social experiments as a way to measure the effectiveness of poverty-alleviating interventions.

In this section, Esther Duflo discusses how randomized controlled trials (RCTs) can be applied to social policy in the same way that they have been used in medicine. She explains how RCTs were used in the Udaipur District, Rajasthan to study the problem of low immunization rates among children. By providing a monthly camp where parents can get their children vaccinated, and adding a kilo of lentils as an incentive, the immunization rate increased from 6% to 38%. Additionally, Duflo discusses a similar trial in Kenya where discount vouchers were given to people for bed nets. The study found that when people had to pay for bed nets, the coverage rate significantly dropped.

In this section, Esther Duflo argues that social policy needs to be approached scientifically through experimentation and fine-tuning to determine the most effective and efficient approach to achieve policy goals. She provides examples of how experiments have shown that providing information on the benefits of education and deworming children are surprisingly effective yet cheap interventions that have significant positive outcomes. Duflo argues that poverty as a problem is mostly invisible, complex, and requires multiple interventions to achieve sustainable and long-term solutions. She emphasizes that social policy solutions require a range of options that are scientifically proven to be successful and efficient.

In this section, Esther Duflo talks about the power of evidence-based action with the example of deworming. Although worms are not a problem that is particularly easy to tackle in the public eye, when the numbers surrounding deworming were presented at Davos, a grassroots effort was launched that resulted in the deworming of 20 million school-aged children in 2009. Duflo emphasizes that fighting poverty is a slow process that requires continual experimentation, with practicality trumping ideology in some cases. While there is no one miracle cure, Duflo believes that the use of economic strategies can be just as powerful and life-changing as modern medicine. Finally, Duflo emphasizes that the aid that has been given in the past cannot necessarily be counted on to have made a difference, but by focusing on continual experimentation and finding what really works, a better global future can be created.
