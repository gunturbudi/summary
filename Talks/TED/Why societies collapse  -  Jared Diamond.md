# Summary of Why societies collapse | Jared Diamond

Jared Diamond discusses his five-point framework for analyzing societal collapses and gives examples of collapsed societies, such as the Greenland Norse and Montana. The common threads among collapsed societies are human impacts on the environment, climate change, relations with neighboring and hostile societies, and political, economic, social, and cultural factors that hinder the solution of environmental problems. Diamond suggests that to understand the fragility of a society, we need to look beyond its wealth and at the first and second derivatives of the function. Additionally, decision-making elites often prioritize short-term gains over the long-term interests of society, and strongly held values can hinder course corrections. There are around 12 environmental time bombs, and all need to be addressed to avoid collapse within a few decades. Diamond concludes by emphasizing that resolving these issues requires everyone's contribution.

In this section, Jared Diamond discusses his five-point framework for analyzing societal collapses, using the collapse of the Greenland Norse society as an example. He suggests that collapsing societies tend to exhibit human impacts on the environment, climate change, relations with neighboring societies, relations with hostile societies, and political, economic, social, and cultural factors that hinder solution of environmental problems. In the case of the Greenland Norse, the Vikings caused soil erosion and deforestation, faced colder climate, saw dwindling trade with Norway (their mother country), experienced hostile relationships with the Inuit, and had cultural factors that made it difficult for them to solve their problems.

In this section, Jared Diamond discusses how Montana, despite appearing to be a pristine environment, is suffering from serious environmental problems such as toxic waste and agricultural issues from climate change. He also lists a checklist of factors that contribute to a society's collapse, including human environmental impacts, climate change, relations with friendly and hostile entities, and political, economic, social, and cultural attitudes. One common thread among collapsed societies is their rapid collapse after reaching their peak in power, often due to a mismatch between resource consumption and economic outlays. Diamond suggests that to understand the fragility of a society, we should look at the first and second derivatives of the function, rather than just at the wealth itself. Furthermore, there are often many subtle environmental factors that contribute to a society's collapse, and we need to better understand them.

In this section, Jared Diamond discusses why societies may fail to solve their problems or tackle environmental issues that could lead to their collapse. One reason is the conflict of interest between the short-term gains of decision-making elites and the long-term interests of society, where if what's good for the elite is bad for society as a whole, there's a risk that society may collapse in the long run. Another reason is the difficulty of changing course when there is a conflict involving strongly held values that are both a source of strength and the things that get the society in trouble. The ticking time bombs of the modern world are also discussed, emphasizing the need to take corrective action in the present to avoid future collapse.

In this section, Jared Diamond discusses the various environmental problems that are threatening the sustainability of societies. He explains that there are around 12 time bombs, including water, soil, climate change, population, and toxics, and any one of them could lead to collapse within a few decades. He emphasizes that it is not about identifying the most critical problem but addressing all of them. The biggest threat, he says, is from problems that are entirely of our own making, and we have the power to resolve them. He concludes by saying that there is a lot that needs to be understood and done, and everyone can contribute to resolving these issues.
