Rasmus Ankersen is a business professor at Copenhagen Business School and the co-founder of a sports analytics company.

Matthew Benham is a gambler who convinced Rasmus Ankersen, an engineer, that the brightest guys in football don't work for football clubs. They work in the gambling industry. Benham bought Brentford, a team he supported as a teenager, and he and Rasmus have run the club together for the past four years. In the first season, they won the first championship in the club's history and a year later they became world-famous because they beat Manchester United in the Europa League. Unfortunately, in the UK, that's more perceived as the absolute embarrassment of Manchester United than the genius of Midtjylland.

Rasmus Ankersen discusses how gambling can be used to help better understand how to outthink one's competition, with a focus on sports. He argues that, due to the high level of randomness in football, a team's success or failure is often due to factors that are unrelated to the quality of its management or performance. Ankersen gives the example of Newcastle United, who, despite finishing fifth in the Premier League, were ultimately unsuccessful due to their low shot differential and high conversion rate. He argues that, if a company is expected to maintain success over time, it is important to ask difficult questions about why that success occurred and why it may not be sustainable.
