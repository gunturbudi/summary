In this section, Elizabeth Nyamayaro shares her childhood experience in Zimbabwe during a famine, where a girl in a blue uniform who came to feed children left an impression on her. Her experience of inequality and guilt of having much more than the rest of her village led her to strive towards uplifting others, eventually leading her to her current role with UN Women. She then introduces HeForShe, a UN Women initiative launched under Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka's leadership that invites men and boys to stand in solidarity with women for gender equality. The initiative's goal is to create a shared vision for gender equality by uplifting all of us, women and men together.
