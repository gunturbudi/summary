# Summary of How does income affect childhood brain development? | Kimberly Noble

The study found that children from lower income families have smaller cortical surfaces on the outside of their brains, which is associated with lower intelligence. The study is looking to see if reducing poverty in early childhood has any effect on cognitive, emotional, and brain development. If the hypotheses prove correct, it will have important implications for social services.

The author discusses how income affects childhood brain development and how schools, teachers, and parents can help disadvantaged children. She discusses how one approach to help is to focus on the home language environment, where children hear a high number of words. She also discusses how giving money to mothers during their child's early life may help improve their brain development.

The study is looking to see if reducing poverty in early childhood has any effect on cognitive, emotional, and brain development. The study will take place over the course of several years and 1,000 newborns will be involved. If the hypotheses prove correct, it will have important implications for social services.
