Margaret Heffernan discusses how teams that are highly attuned and sensitive to each other can flow and grow ideas more effectively, and how this is important for companies in order to create value. She cites examples of how companies have successfully implemented social capital initiatives, such as synchronizing coffee breaks to promote communication and collaboration.

While the idea of social capital may seem obvious, it is often overlooked in favor of individual achievement in workplaces. By focusing on creating a supportive environment for team members, companies can achieve greater success and productivity.

Margaret Heffernan discusses how social capital is important for creativity and innovation. She relates this to her experience as an actor, where she observed that good ideas are born from conflict and candor. She suggests that, in order to achieve the best possible results, we need to work together instead of competing against each other. Heffernan also discusses how successful organizations, such as the Montreal Protocol, adopt three key principles: everyone is important, work is done to one standard only, and leaders should let their team members share their ideas. These principles are effective because they allow for the best possible ideas to be brought to light.
