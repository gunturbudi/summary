# Summary of Aparna Rao: Art that craves your attention

Aparna Rao is an artist who explores the ways in which an object or space can capture and hold attention. In her work "Framerunners," for example, a window is made of three different thicknesses of wooden boards, each inhabited by a tribe of small, movable figures that have a comical and slapstick-like quality. The figures move along a track in response to the viewer's movements, but hide behind the fastest wall when they sense movement.

Aparna Rao discusses her works in progress, which explore the ways in which an object or space can capture and hold attention. In the Imperial Monochromes, for example, panels of chaotic color instantly transform into ordered symmetry when a viewer's attention is drawn to them. Handheld features a stationary piece of paper that appears to be struggling to maintain its balance, and Decoy is a small, sound-producing sculpture that seeks to engage and distract onlookers. The last work, an amphitheater-shaped sound instrument, captures the attention of an audience by using its size and visual prominence to dominate the view.
