In this section, Chris Hadfield discusses how conquering fear and changing our fundamental behavior can allow us to achieve things that would be denied to us otherwise. He explains how practicing things going wrong and going through various dangerous scenarios, like walking through spiderwebs, can help us overcome our natural panicky reactions. For example, when he and his crew were blinded during a spacewalk, they were able to stay calm and safely finish the job. Similarly, when they returned to Earth in a Soyuz capsule, they were not screaming, but laughing because they had trained for the experience, knew how to operate the vehicle, and were able to safely land using the parachutes. Conquering fear allows us to appreciate the beauty around us and unlocks immense opportunities that come with taking risks.
