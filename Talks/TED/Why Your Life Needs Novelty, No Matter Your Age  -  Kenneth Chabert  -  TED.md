# Summary of Why Your Life Needs Novelty, No Matter Your Age | Kenneth Chabert | TED

Kenneth Chabert emphasizes the importance of powerful first experiences (PFEs) in changing one's perception of self and the world, which are often achieved through novelty. He describes how older people tend to reminisce about experiences during their 15-30 years due to the high level of novelty during that time period, and encourages young people to seek similar experiences to increase their social and cultural capital. Chabert suggests intentionally seeking out new and different environments to collect more PFEs, expanding one's networks and changing one's perspective.

In this section, Kenneth Chabert describes his first visit to Montana and how it gave him a sudden realization about powerful first experiences (PFEs), which he defines as an activity in a place one never thought to be in. He explains that these kinds of experiences change how one views themselves and the world. Chabert references the reminiscence bump, where older people tend to speak about the experiences they had from 15 to 30 years old. This time period is characterized by high novelty, which decreases as habits start to develop. Chabert talks about creating PFEs to give young men the opportunity to have life-changing experiences and increase their social and cultural capital.

In this section, Kenneth Chabert discusses the concepts of cultural and social capital, and how collecting powerful first experiences can increase both. Cultural capital refers to the knowledge, skills, and beliefs an individual gains from their environment, while social capital involves shared values and resources that allow individuals to come together to achieve a common goal. By intentionally seeking out new experiences in different environments, individuals can expand their networks and change the way they see themselves and the world. Chabert encourages others to try something new with a certain level of risk and to switch up their environment to collect more powerful first experiences.
