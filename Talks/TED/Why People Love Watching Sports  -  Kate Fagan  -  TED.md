# Summary of Why People Love Watching Sports | Kate Fagan | TED

In her TED talk, Kate Fagan discusses how sports are more than just physical activity, and that what compels us to watch sports is not just the excitement of the game, but the competition and the sense of competition. She argues that, because women's sports don't have the same level of importance as men's sports, they don't generate the same level of excitement and interest. She suggests that, in order to make sports more equitable, we need to focus on the storylines and stakes involved in women's sports as well.
