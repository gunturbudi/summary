# Summary of Kenneth Shinozuka: My simple invention, designed to keep my grandfather safe

Kenneth Shinozuka shares his experience with his grandfather, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, and how his wandering caused stress for his family. He invented a wearable sensor that detects pressure and sends an audible alert to a caregiver's smartphone when an Alzheimer's patient steps onto the floor, which he tested on his grandfather for a year with a 100 percent success rate in detecting his grandfather's wandering. He faced challenges in creating the sensor, designing the circuit, and coding the smartphone app, which he overcame by creating prototypes and beta testing the device at several residential care facilities. Shinozuka also discusses how sensor data collected from patients using his device can be used to improve patient care and possibly lead to a cure for the disease.

In this section, Kenneth Shinozuka shares his personal experience with his grandfather who suffers from Alzheimer's disease and how his wandering caused stress for his family. He invented a wearable sensor that detects pressure and sends an audible alert to a caregiver's smartphone when an Alzheimer's patient steps onto the floor, which he tested on his grandfather for a year with a 100 percent success rate in detecting his grandfather's wandering. He also faces three main challenges in creating the sensor, designing the circuit, and coding the smartphone app, which he overcame by creating two prototypes and beta testing the device at several residential care facilities in California.
