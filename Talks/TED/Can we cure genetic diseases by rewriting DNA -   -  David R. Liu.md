# Summary of Can we cure genetic diseases by rewriting DNA? | David R. Liu

David R. Liu discusses how base editing can be used to correct point mutations that cause genetic diseases. He explains how the technology works and how it is being applied in a variety of ways.

Base editing is a technology that can be used to correct point mutations that cause genetic diseases. The technology was developed by researchers in David Liu's laboratory, and the first successful application of the technology was in the treatment of sickle cell anemia.

Base editors use the programmable searching mechanism of CRISPR scissors to convert one DNA letter into another. While they do not exist in nature, they were developed from three proteins that do not originate from the same organism. The first class of base editor converts Cs into Ts, while the second class of editor converts As into Gs or Ts into Cs. However, they have an incredible problem; there is no protein that can transport the editors to the correct location in a genome.

Nicole developed a protein that can convert A into G in DNA, and used it to create a second base editor that can convert As into Gs. This technology is being applied in a variety of ways, including correcting genetic diseases.

David R. Liu talks about how genetic diseases can be cured by rewriting DNA, and how students have been working hard to make this a reality.
