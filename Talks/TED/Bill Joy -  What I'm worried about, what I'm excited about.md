# Summary of Bill Joy: What I'm worried about, what I'm excited about

Bill Joy, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems, shares his concerns about emerging technologies like nanotechnology and genetic engineering which can potentially result in mass destruction and pandemics. He advocates for limiting the access of individuals to pandemic power and relying on public policy and moral progress to limit the danger of new technologies. Additionally, sensible defense should be put in place to prevent a potential pandemic, as opposed to giving up the rule of law to fight terrorism. Joy, who invests in education, new materials to improve the environment and genetic medicine, believes in using technology to make the green dream a reality. To address the risk of a pandemic, he emphasizes the need for new anti-virals, broad-spectrum vaccines, and policy solutions with accountability measures in place.

In this section, Bill Joy talks about his research on global poverty and how simple technologies such as clean water can make a huge difference in reducing poverty rates. However, he becomes very concerned about the potential for misuse of new emerging technologies such as nanotechnology and genetic engineering. Individuals now have access to technologies that could potentially lead to mass destruction and pandemics, a situation for which we have no direct experience. The solution, according to Joy, is to limit the ability of individuals to access pandemic power by relying on public policy and moral progress to limit the danger of these new technologies. Additionally, sensible defense should be put in place to prevent a potential pandemic from occurring.

In this section, Bill Joy talks about his perspective on fighting terrorism and how giving up the rule of law to fight it is not the answer. He also emphasizes that we cannot use a million-dollar response to address a million-to-one cost-benefit ratio problem. Later on, he talks about the three areas he is excited about and investing in, including education and the potential of Moore's Law, new materials to improve our ability to address environmental problems, and genetic medicine. Joy acknowledges the need for education in the world and how technology can help address this issue, but emphasizes that we need to develop the necessary software to fully harness the potential of innovative devices.

In this section, Bill Joy discusses new materials that have been discovered in recent years and their potential to create innovative solutions to environmental problems. Carbon nanotubes, for instance, have exceptional properties such as great strength, stiffness, and conductivity that can be applied to develop new ways of producing water, fuel cells, catalyze chemical reactions, and cut pollution. Joy believes that investing in these new materials is a viable and profitable means of finally making the green dream a reality. Additionally, Joy talks about a pandemic in biodefense that Kleiner has recently raised $200 million to fund. The team is searching for innovative solutions to address gaps in surveillance, diagnostic, resistance, and systems of a possible epidemic in the future, and there are already many technologies available.

In this section, Bill Joy discusses the need for new anti-virals, broad-spectrum vaccines, and policy solutions to help address the risk of a pandemic. While technology can aid in solving some of our problems, it cannot solve the problem of managing technology itself. The abuse of power can be a risk if we let an unlimited amount of power loose, and we need better policy to address this issue, such as using markets to price in the cost of catastrophe. In addition, people must be held accountable for their actions, and we need to limit access to certain information to help the people on the defensive side have an advantage over those who want to abuse things. Designing the future is also important in steering us to a lower-risk place.
