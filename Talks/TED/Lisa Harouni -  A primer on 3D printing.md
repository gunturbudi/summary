In this section, Lisa Harouni explains how 3D printing works and how it has the potential to disrupt manufacturing and impact our lives. Using CAD data from professional product design programs, a 3D printer slices the data and deposits material, layer by layer, to create a physical object. With this process, intricate and complex designs can be created that are impossible with other manufacturing technologies. From simple phone covers to spinal implants, there is a wide range of products that can be created with 3D printing.

In this section, Lisa Harouni talks about who is using 3D printing and how it can break away from the constraints of mass production. The technology is being used by product designers, architects, aerospace and automotive industries, and even for creating better implants. The detail and quality of the products are improving, while the price of the machines is falling, making them more accessible. However, the barrier to entry is the creation of the data that 3D printers read. With the advent of new technologies, processes, and software, Harouni believes that 3D printing will cause a revolution in manufacturing and change the landscape of spare part supply chains.

In this section, Lisa Harouni describes the next generation of customization made possible by 3D printing, where individuals can manipulate the shape, color, and material of products within safe boundaries. This personalization goes beyond just aesthetic variations of the same product but allows individuals to customize and create personalized, functional products such as prosthetics and dental coatings. The technology is even advancing to the point of using MRI scans to build intricate body parts. Harouni concludes that this technology is bound to cause a manufacturing revolution and change the landscape of manufacturing.
