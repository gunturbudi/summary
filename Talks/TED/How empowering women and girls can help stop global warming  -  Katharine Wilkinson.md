# Summary of How empowering women and girls can help stop global warming | Katharine Wilkinson

In this video, Katherine Wilkinson explains the link between gender equity and solutions to reduce climate-changing emissions. She emphasizes the need for gender equity as the 80 best practices and technologies for reducing emissions depend on empowering women and girls. She discusses addressing agriculture inequity can lead to rising farm yields, preventing deforestation, reducing emissions, and hunger. She also emphasizes how education and family planning can lead to lower emissions and curb the growth of human population, thereby reducing emissions. Moreover, the speaker highlights how women can contribute as a vital voice to fight climate change and the need for collaboration and diversity in moving solutions forward, as women and girls are an essential force of possibility for addressing climate change, and we should seize this opportunity to work together towards this common goal.

In this section, the speaker explains the link between gender equity and solutions to draw down heat-trapping, climate-changing emissions in the atmosphere. The speaker, who has been working on an effort called "Project Drawdown," explains that the 80 best practices and technologies for reducing emissions depend on equity for women and girls. While climate impacts hit women and girls the hardest, given their vulnerabilities, empowered women and gender equity can help address global warming by securing women's rights, shoring up resilience, and averting emissions through agriculture and reproductive health.

In this section, the speaker discusses how addressing the inequity in agriculture faced by women smallholders, who have less access to resources, can lead farm yields to rise by 20 to 30 percent. This can prevent deforestation, reduce emissions and hunger as existing farms could produce enough food. Addressing this issue could prevent two billion tons of emissions by 2050. Moreover, the speaker emphasizes how education and family planning can lead to lower emissions and curb the growth of the human population. This can reduce demand for goods, services, and energy, thereby reducing emissions. According to Project Drawdown, closing the gaps on access to education and family planning can avoid nearly 120 billion tons of emissions.

In this section, Katherine Wilkinson discusses how women can contribute as a vital voice to fight climate change. She highlights the injustice against women in philanthropic funding, where only 0.2 percent of philanthropic funds go towards women and the environment, amounting to only $110 million globally, contrasting it to the $110 million spent on a single Basquiat painting. We need diversity and collaboration to move solutions forward to meet the challenge of climate change, and the role of the messenger, speaker, and educator has great significance in breaking the silence and sharing solutions. The speaker emphasizes that women and girls are an essential force of possibility for addressing climate change, and we should seize this opportunity to work together towards this common goal.
