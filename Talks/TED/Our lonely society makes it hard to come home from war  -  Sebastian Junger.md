# Summary of Our lonely society makes it hard to come home from war | Sebastian Junger

Sebastian Junger discusses the issue of long-term PTSD in veterans, as well as the idea that PTSD among veterans may be caused in part by the struggle to reintegrate into a society that is alienating and difficult for everyone. He suggests that the feeling of tribal connection experienced in the military can be replaced by alienation upon returning home to a divided society. Junger argues that Americans need to unify to prevent veterans from feeling unsupported and isolated in their community.

In this section, Sebastian Junger discusses his experience with PTSD after returning from Afghanistan and how it can affect individuals long term. He reveals that around 20% of people experience short-term PTSD, but around 50% of veterans file some kind of PTSD compensation from the government, resulting in what he calls long-term PTSD. Junger believes that those who are vulnerable to long-term PTSD are people who were abused as children or who suffer from low education levels, psychiatric disorders in their family, or who have experienced trauma as children. Interestingly, Junger points out that although casualty rates in the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been one third of that in Vietnam, disability rates three times more. Furthermore, 22 vets are said to commit suicide daily, but most of those are Vietnam War veterans.

In this section of the video, Sebastian Junger discusses the idea that PTSD rates among veterans might, in part, be caused by their reentry into a society that is alienating and hard on people even if they haven’t been in combat. Junger questions whether PTSD is the right term for what affects some soldiers and instead suggests “post-deployment alienation disorder” as a way to describe alienation and depression that some soldiers face on their return home. He notes that a feeling of tribal closeness overseas can be replaced with alienation when they come back to a modern society that is hard on everyone, let alone someone who has been in the military.

In this section, Sebastian Junger discusses how the sense of community and connection felt by soldiers in the military disappears when they return home to a divided society. He explains that traumatizing an entire society usually results in unification, but America is now a country with bitter divisions and two warring political parties. This is causing veterans to feel more depressed as they return home to a country that is so divided that its different factions accuse each other of being traitors. Junger argues that Americans need to unify to help veterans readjust and prevent them from feeling isolated and unsupported in their community.
