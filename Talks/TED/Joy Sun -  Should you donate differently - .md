# Summary of Joy Sun: Should you donate differently?

Joy Sun advocates for the benefits of unconditional cash transfer as a way to break the mold of old aid systems. She suggests using payment technology to send money directly to the mobile accounts of the world's poorest people without intermediaries. This method has been successfully implemented by GiveDirectly, the first organization that is exclusively dedicated to providing cash transfers to the poor. Evidence shows that people invested in their local economies and businesses and prioritized material and spiritual needs. Sun argues that giving cash directly to the poor can be more efficient and free of corruption than traditional forms of aid. Instead of just doing some good, organizations should focus on proving that they are doing more good for the poor than the poor can do for themselves.
