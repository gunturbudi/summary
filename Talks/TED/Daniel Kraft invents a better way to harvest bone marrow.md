# Summary of Daniel Kraft invents a better way to harvest bone marrow

Dr. Daniel Kraft discusses the inefficiency and pain associated with the current bone marrow harvesting procedure, leading him to develop the Marrow Miner. This device uses a flexible powered catheter with a special wire loop that aspirates rich bone marrow rapidly and with less discomfort than the current method. The Marrow Miner has yielded ten times the stem cell activity in pig studies, and this innovation could encourage more donors and ultimately increase the number of bone marrow transplant survivors.

In this section, Dr. Daniel Kraft explains that the current bone marrow harvesting procedure is painful for the donor and involves multiple needle insertions, which inspired him to develop a more efficient and less invasive method called the Marrow Miner. The device features a flexible powered catheter with a special wire loop that enters the bone only once and rapidly aspirates rich bone marrow. Pig studies have shown that the Marrow Miner yields ten times the stem cell activity in the marrow compared to the conventional device. This innovation may encourage more potential bone marrow donors, enable individuals to bank their own marrow stem cells, and ultimately increase the number of bone marrow transplant survivors in the future.
