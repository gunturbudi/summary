# Summary of The Amazing AI Super Tutor for Students and Teachers | Sal Khan | TED

Sal Khan, founder of Khan Academy, demonstrates how AI can be used as a personal tutor to revolutionize education. He introduces the Khanmigo, an AI-powered tutor that can function as a guidance counselor, academic coach, career coach, and life coach, allowing students to engage with historical figures, collaborate with the system to improve their writing skills, and enhance their language arts and reading comprehension skills. Additionally, the AI has the potential to provide personalized feedback, teach material, help create lesson plans and progress reports, and eventually grade. While emphasizing the importance of regulating AI, Khan also highlights its positive potential to enhance human intelligence and purpose, urging that this should be the focus of AI development.
