# Summary of How will we survive when the population hits 10 billion? | Charles C. Mann

The speaker in the video discusses the challenge of humanity's exponential growth and consumption, and how this could potentially lead to us hitting the edge of the "petri dish" like other outbreak species. With a projected population of 10 billion humans by 2050, researchers have identified two groups of people with opposed views: the wizards who believe technology and science will solve problems and the prophets who want less consumption and resource conservation. Both sides face obstacles in implementing their solutions, such as public distrust of genetically-engineered crops and clean nuclear power, and small-scale, solar-powered communities remaining largely in the realm of fantasy. The speaker concludes that humanity's ability to overcome natural constraints depends on our willingness to change habits and use knowledge more wisely, and that wizards and prophets must work together to find solutions.

In this section, the speaker talks about how humanity has become an outbreak species, which is when a species exceeds the bounds of natural selection and the population explodes rapidly. He argues that humanity's advancements in technology and science have led to exponential growth and consumption, potentially causing us to hit the edge of the "petri dish" and suffer the same fate as other outbreak species. With a projected population of 10 billion humans by 2050, the speaker highlights the two groups of people that researchers have identified: the wizards who believe technology and science will allow humans to produce their way out of dilemmas, and the prophets who want society to use less and conserve resources to avoid catastrophe. These two groups disagree on the types of technology and economic systems that will be required to prevent humanity from hitting the edge of the petri dish.

In this section, the speaker outlines the opposing views of wizards, who believe in using technology and science to solve problems, and prophets, who envision a more agrarian, community-based society. However, both sides face obstacles in implementing their solutions. Wizards' genetically-engineered crops and clean nuclear power face public distrust and opposition, while prophets' small-scale, solar-powered communities remain largely in the realm of fantasy. Furthermore, despite growing concern about climate change, the world's energy consumption from fossil fuels has only increased. The speaker concludes that, ultimately, we are not immune to natural constraints, and our ability to overcome them depends on our willingness to change our habits and use our knowledge more wisely.

In this section, journalist Charles Mann discusses the importance of wizards and prophets working together to find solutions to the challenges of a world with a population of 10 billion. He notes that while there has been decades of hostility between the two sides, they must come together and accept each other's fundamental premises, such as nuclear power being both safe and carbon-free, to make insightful ideas like small neighborhood scale, temporary nukes, and genetic modification of crops taking into account their impact on the environment, flourish. Success would mean far more than just survival but may ultimately lead to the realization that humans are special if they can overcome their own outbreak and safeguard the biome.
