Alex Honnold describes how he overcame his fear of climbing cliffs by gradually building up his comfort and by drawing inspiration from other free soloists. In 2008, he attempted Half Dome, an iconic 2,000-foot wall, but failed due to a lack of preparation. He decided to skip the preparations and go for an adventure, and succeeded when he climbed the route unroped and with a friend two days before. On the day of the climb, he reached a foothold that he didn't trust and began to doubt himself. He overcame his fear by using his experience and intuition to find a foothold that he could trust and then charging towards the summit.
