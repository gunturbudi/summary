# Summary of Meet the microscopic life in your home -- and on your face | Anne Madden

In this YouTube video, Anne Madden, a scientist from North Carolina State University, talks about the fascinating world of microscopic life that lives on our bodies and in our homes. She and her fellow researchers use advanced DNA techniques to identify and study the thousands of species of microorganisms that can transform their environment and produce unique chemical compounds with the potential to solve human problems. Madden believes that these microorganisms will play a key role in solving pressing issues facing humanity, such as environmental degradation and the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

In this section, Anne Madden, a scientist from North Carolina State University, talks about the thousands of microscopic creatures that live on our faces and fingers. She emphasizes that we overlook the many microbial solutions to human problems and that the next 100 years will focus on those solutions. She and other researchers work to uncover the microscopic life that is nearest us in our most familiar and often boring environments, using Q-tips, tweezers, and advanced DNA techniques. Madden has even discovered and named a new species of fungus, and she believes that most of the life around us remains unknown.

In this section, Anne Madden discusses how her goal is to find new technology from the vast diversity of microscopic life around us that will help save the planet rather than kill the new microscopic life. Madden explains how these creatures that are so small have the ability to transform their environment with an arsenal of chemical tools, which means they can eat everything from toxic waste to plastic and can produce waste products like oil and battery power and even tiny nuggets of real gold. She gives examples of researchers uncovering microorganisms that can make commercial beer or even novel antibacterials that can kill superbugs. Madden emphasizes that in the future, these microscopic creatures will play a key role in solving many of our problems, with 100,000 new sources of solutions to human problems in our homes alone.
