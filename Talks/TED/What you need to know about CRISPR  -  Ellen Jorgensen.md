# Summary of What you need to know about CRISPR | Ellen Jorgensen

In the video "What you need to know about CRISPR," Ellen Jorgensen explains the two-part system behind CRISPR and the modular targeting system that allows precise editing of specific parts of a genome. She highlights the importance of proper regulation and cautions that while CRISPR has positive implications for disease research, it cannot be used meaningfully outside of a professional lab. Additionally, she dispels the notion that CRISPR technology is cheap and easy and warns of the patent battle surrounding it. Overall, while CRISPR is an essential technology that researchers must responsibly explore, it is not as simple as people suggest.

In this section, the speaker discusses the science behind the CRISPR technology, which involves a two-part system consisting of a Cas9 protein and a guide RNA that can edit genomes by targeting a specific DNA sequence with a false piece of DNA. The guide RNA is only 20 letters long and can easily target different genomic locations, and the modular targeting system allows for precise editing of specific parts of a genome. However, the speaker also warns of the speed at which the science is moving and the importance of regulating it properly, as well as dispelling the notion that CRISPR technology is cheap and easy, as it requires expertise and precision.

In this section, CRISPR technology cost and ease of use are discussed. While it has made experiments cheaper and faster, and has positive implications for things like disease research, it cannot be done meaningfully outside of a professional lab. There are also concerns surrounding the patent battle, which means even if one were to invent something using the technology, a hefty licensing fee would likely be required. In terms of ease of use, it is not as simple as people suggest, with numerous unknowns surrounding the biology of cells and complications that arise when trying to apply the CRISPR system to the whole body. It is certainly not 'plug-and-play,' but it is an essential technology that researchers must continue to explore responsibly.
