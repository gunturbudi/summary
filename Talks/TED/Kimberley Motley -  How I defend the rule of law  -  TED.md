# Summary of Kimberley Motley: How I defend the rule of law | TED

Lawyer Kimberley Motley shares two stories from her experiences in Afghanistan and emphasizes the importance of using law as a point of leverage to protect societies. In the first story, she represents a young girl in a refugee camp who is being forced into marriage to pay off her family's debt. Motley presides over a second jirga and secures justice for the girl while highlighting the importance of journalists and freedom of the press to protect democracies. In the second story, she represents a young woman who was sold into marriage, forced into prostitution, and tortured by her in-laws. Motley believes that enforcing laws and accountability for governments, businesses, and individuals can contribute to a global human rights economy and create a culture of transparency and justice for all. She advocates for everyone to become a global investor in human rights to achieve justice together.

In this section of the talk, lawyer Kimberley Motley shares the story of Naghma, a young girl in a refugee camp in Afghanistan whose family is in debt to a neighbor, and as a result, jirga suggests that Naghma should marry a 21-year-old man to pay off the debt, when she is only six years old. Despite common thoughts of Afghanistan being a failed state, it has a legal system, and, by looking at Naghma's case, Motley shows that laws are meant to protect people rather than putting them in harm's way. She became the first foreigner to litigate in Afghan courts, fighting for an improvement in justice and rights for people like Naghma.

In this section, Kimberley Motley explains how she was able to defend the rule of law in Afghanistan by presiding over a second jirga to put the law at the center of the dispute. The judge ordered the first decision to be erased, the debt to be satisfied, and a written order to be signed in which all men admitted their illegality. Motleyâ€™s job carries many risks, but she sees that the rewards far outweigh the risk. She emphasizes that the law as a point of leverage is crucial in protecting societies. She also highlights the importance of journalists and freedom of the press to protect democracies worldwide.
