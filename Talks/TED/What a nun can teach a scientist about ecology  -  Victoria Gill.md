# Summary of What a nun can teach a scientist about ecology | Victoria Gill

In this YouTube video, Science and Environment Correspondent Victoria Gill highlights the need for collaboration between scientists and local people with valuable knowledge to save endangered species, such as the achoque salamander, which was conserved through the work of the Sisters of the Immaculate Health in Mexico. Gill emphasizes that humility and listening are essential when working with local people who have traditional ecological knowledge and offers various examples, including a collaboration with a former poacher and scientists working with local communities in Chernobyl. To assess the state of the natural world, Gill suggests every research project should include local farmers, Indigenous community leaders, or other groups involved in the research proposal. The speaker concludes by discussing the creation of a "cultural concept framework" to include indigenous knowledge in this area and the importance of the International Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services as an example of these partnerships.

In this section, the speaker introduces her favorite animal, the axolotl, and highlights how some species are threatened by extinction due to pollution and overfishing. She then advocates for the need to work with local people who have practical wisdom and valuable knowledge to save species at risk of extinction. She cites the example of the achoque, a critically endangered salamander found in Lake PÃ¡tzcuaro in Mexico. The Sisters of the Immaculate Health, a group of nuns with a shared history with the achoque, are instrumental in creating a captive breeding program for the species, allowing for the continuation of medicine production while conserving a critically endangered species.

In this section, the speaker discusses the benefit of unusual partnerships, such as the unlikely alliance between scientists and nuns to save a species of freshwater turtle in Mexico. However, the speaker notes that these kinds of partnerships are not common due to the traditional academic system's hierarchical structure and a hubris that science is an enterprise for the elite. The speaker stresses the importance of humility and listening and mentions several examples, including a conservationist's collaboration with a former poacher and a team of scientists working with local communities in Chernobyl. The speaker concludes with an emphasis on the International Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, which is an ambitious example of these kinds of partnerships.

In this section, the speaker discusses a "cultural concept framework" created by an international group to include local and indigenous knowledge of nature in assessing the state of the natural world. Indigenous people are important caretakers of 25% of the world's land surface and their knowledge can offer valuable insights. The speaker suggests that every research project should include local farmers, Indigenous community leaders, or other groups involved in the research proposal. The speaker cites the example of a nun-led successful breeding program for an almost extinct species that was achieved through the simple goal of "providing happiness."
