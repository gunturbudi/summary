# Summary of Nina Jablonski breaks the illusion of skin color

Nina Jablonski, a professor of genetics at University of Utah, discusses the evolution of human skin color in this video. She points to data from a NASA satellite that shows that much of the Northern Hemisphere is in cool gray zones, meaning that the intensity of ultraviolet radiation is low and this may have led to the evolution of lighter skin pigmentation in some parts of the world. When humans dispersed into new environments, they lost their pigmentation, as natural selection favored lightly pigmented skin. Three times this process has happened in different human ancestors. The video also features President Barack Obama, who is of mixed race, and resembles people from southern Africa and Southeast Asia, which has contributed to his good health.

Nina Jablonski discusses the differences in skin color around the world, noting that darker skin pigmentation is found closer to the equator and lighter skin pigmentation is found closer to the poles. She discusses Charles Darwin's observation that skin color is one of the most conspicuous differences between human races and the evolutionary factors that led to this. She points to data from a NASA satellite that shows that much of the Northern Hemisphere is in cool gray zones, meaning that the intensity of ultraviolet radiation is low and this may have led to the evolution of lighter skin pigmentation in some parts of the world.

The video discusses the evolution of human skin color and the importance of ultraviolet radiation. The author notes that humans evolved light pigmentation in response to less intense ultraviolet radiation in colder environments. When humans dispersed into new environments, they lost their pigmentation, as natural selection favored lightly pigmented skin. Three times this process has happened in different human ancestors.

This video discusses the evolution of skin color, and how it is a demonstration of natural selection. The video features Nina Jablonski, a professor of genetics at University of Utah, who discusses how people with different skin pigmentation live in different environments, and how this has consequences for their health. The video also features President Barack Obama, who is of mixed race, and resembles people from southern Africa and Southeast Asia, which has contributed to his good health.
