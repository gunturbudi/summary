In this section, Jimmy Carter talks about three major human rights abuses against women. The first is genital mutilation that's still being practiced in many countries, with Egypt having 98% women subjected to this torture. Secondly, there are honor killings, where women are murdered in the family because they are deemed to have disgraced their family. Finally, Carter talks about human trafficking or slavery, where 80% of people traded are women, and they are forced into the sex trade. Carter suggests that countries should adopt Sweden's model to tackle sex trafficking, where prostitution is not punished, but brothel owners and male customers are held responsible. He suggests that America's 25:1 ratio of women arrested vs. men arrested for illegal sex trade is wrong.
