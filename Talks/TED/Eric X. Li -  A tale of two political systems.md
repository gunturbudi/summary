# Summary of Eric X. Li: A tale of two political systems

Eric X. Li gives a talk about the two political systems in China: the one-party state and democracy. He argues that the one-party state is a more successful system, due to its meritocracy and responsiveness. He also predicts that China will become the world's largest economy within the next 10 years.

Detail Summary:

Eric Li's grandparents were living in China during the Cultural Revolution, when he was born. He grew up in the United States, first as a Berkeley hippie and later disillusioned with the failed religion of his youth. He tells the story of two political systems, one taught to him in China and another in America, which he eventually comes to believe in. China's rapid economic growth in the last 30 years disproves the theory of linear political development, and Li argues that democracy, not capitalism, is the path to success for developing countries.

Eric X. Li outlines the two systems in China: the one-party state, which is adaptive, meritocratic, and Legitimate, and the other system, which is a one-party state that is not adaptive, is closed, and illegitimate.

The speaker discusses China's system of government, which has three tracks: the base level, fuju level, and ju level. The good cadres (those who make it to the fuju level and beyond) move up through the system, eventually becoming high officials. The system is based on merit and patronage doesn't play a role. Democracy is becoming a "perpetual cycle of elect and regret" in countries with electoral systems, while China's one-party system is still considered to be legitimate.

00:15:00
Eric Li discusses the differences between China's responsive authoritarianism and electoral democracy, and how both systems may have flaws. He predicts that China will become the world's largest economy within the next 10 years and that political reform will continue, despite the one-party system.

00:20:00
Eric X. Li argues that the Chinese concept of civil society is different from the Western concept, and that this difference has implications for how the two societies operate. He says that, while civil society in the West is separate from the political system, in China it is part of a cohesive political order.
