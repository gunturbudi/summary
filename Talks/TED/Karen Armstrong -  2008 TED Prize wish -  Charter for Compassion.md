# Summary of Karen Armstrong: 2008 TED Prize wish: Charter for Compassion

Karen Armstrong's TED Prize wish is for the creation of a Charter for Compassion that emphasizes the importance of compassion in all major world religions. According to Armstrong, religion is not solely about intellectual assent to certain creeds but a call to action that prioritizes compassion as a key practice. She emphasizes the importance of finding compassion even in difficult texts and calls for a move beyond toleration toward appreciation of each other. Armstrong hopes that the Charter will be signed by major religious leaders from all the traditions of the world and recognized by the United Nations as a world initiative to tackle extremism without further escalation.

In this section, Karen Armstrong discusses her surprising journey from leaving the convent and wanting nothing to do with religion to becoming a scholar of various religions. Through her studies, she discovered that "belief" as we know it today wasn't a focus of early religions and that religion is not solely about intellectual assent to certain creeds. Rather, it's a call to action that prioritizes compassion as a key practice. According to Armstrong, we understand religious truths by living them out, and compassion is at the heart of all religions.

In this section, Karen Armstrong discusses the importance of compassion in all major world religions and how it can lead us to a transcendent experience. The Golden Rule, present in all traditions, is the core of this compassion and highlights the importance of treating others as we would like to be treated. However, religion has often been used to oppress others or justify terrorism, indicating a need to extend compassion beyond one's own group. Armstrong emphasizes the importance of finding compassion even in difficult texts, and we must not leave interpretation until we have found a compassionate meaning.

In this section, Karen Armstrong highlights the violence that has been ingrained in our society through armed conflicts that have caused millions of deaths. She argues that even religion has been affected by such a violent ethos, which has led to religious illiteracy and neglect of compassion towards others. However, she also acknowledges the yearning for change and a desire to create global understanding and harmony through the Golden Rule of treating others as one would want to be treated. Armstrong calls for a move beyond toleration toward appreciation of each other and shares a story from "The Iliad" to illustrate the importance of spirituality in promoting compassion and harmony.

She argues that the ethos of compassion is found in all religions and is based on the Golden Rule. Armstrong's wish is for the creation of a Charter for Compassion, crafted by inspirational thinkers from the three Abrahamic traditions and based on the Golden Rule, in order to remind people of the compassionate ethos found in religion and to empower them to interpret texts in a charitable way. Armstrong hopes that this Charter will be signed by major religious leaders from all the traditions of the world and that media knowledge will be used to spread its message globally.

In this section, Karen Armstrong talks about the importance of the Charter being recognized by the United Nations. She believes that the UN's neutrality can avoid the initiative being seen as a Western or Christian one, and instead make it a world initiative that can help member states tackle extremism without further escalation. Armstrong urges everyone to join her in building, launching, and propagating the charter and making it available in all places of worship, so people can reclaim their religion as a source of peace in the world.
