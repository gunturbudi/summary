# Summary of How We Could Solve the Dark Matter Mystery | Chanda Prescod-Weinstein | TED

In this TED talk, physicist Chanda Prescod-Weinstein explains the mysterious nature of dark matter, highlighting that it constitutes 80% of the universe's matter but is invisible, unlike any other matter we know. She discusses the various hypotheses that physicists have created over the years to explain dark matter and explains that traditional particle physics approaches, like colliders, might not be the best method to search for the hypothetical particles, such as the axion. Instead, she suggests using telescopes from across the electromagnetic spectrum, such as the proposed STROBE-X X-ray space telescope. Prescod-Weinstein also talks about the quantum classification of particles and how axions are bosons, which could allow them to form Bose-Einstein condensates on a galaxy scale, ultimately leading to advancements in our understanding of the universe.

In this section, theoretical physicist Chanda Prescod-Weinstein explains that although we know visible stars and galaxies are composed of elementary particles, the presence of something invisible affects them. She discusses the majority of the universe is composed of invisible matter that is completely invisible to us, and computational mathematicians like Prescod-Weinstein use math to study the origin and evolution of space-time to study our mostly invisible universe. She believes observatories like the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory can help determine what the invisible stuff is, as we are currently in a great cosmic drama where empty space is associated with an energy that increasingly affects space-time expansion, and the majority of the universe is composed of dark matter, which unlike dark energy, gravitates exactly like visible matter.

In this section of the video, physicist Chanda Prescod-Weinstein explains the mysterious nature of dark matter, highlighting that it's invisible, unlike any other matter we know, and something we can't touch or feel. She explains that dark matter contributes to 80% of the matter in the universe and dominates the outskirts of galaxies, including the Milky Way. Physicists believe that every galaxy lives inside its own dark matter halo, and dark matter affects how galaxies distribute throughout space-time. Prescod-Weinstein then moves on to the various hypotheses physicists have created over the years, including the axion, which she considers her favorite candidate for a hypothetical particle.
