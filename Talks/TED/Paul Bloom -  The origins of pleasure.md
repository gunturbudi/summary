# Summary of Paul Bloom: The origins of pleasure

In this YouTube video titled "Paul Bloom: The origins of pleasure," psychologist Paul Bloom discusses how beliefs, perceptions, and personal history can influence the human experience of pleasure. From the story of a Dutch forger who fooled Hitler's second-in-command to experiments on the value of art and music, Bloom shows how our beliefs about an object's hidden nature can affect our pleasure. He also discusses the impact of emotional connections on our valuation of objects and behaviours and how beliefs about pain can affect our perception of it. The video concludes by emphasizing the role of the mind in transforming one's perception of reality.

In this section, Paul Bloom tells the story of a Dutch forger named Han van Meegeren, who managed to sell a "fake" Vermeer painting to Hermann Goering, the second-in-command to Hitler, during the World War II. When van Meegeren was caught, he confessed that he painted the artwork himself and became a hero to the Dutch people, as he had managed to fool even one of the most evil men in history. Bloom argues that humans are natural-born essentialists, reacting to things not just based on what they see but also on their beliefs about an object's hidden nature. He suggests that this is true even for the simplest pleasures, like food, and our beliefs about their hidden essences can influence how pleasurable we find them.

In this section, psychologist Paul Bloom discusses the power of our perceptions and beliefs in shaping the way we experience pleasure. Using examples such as children experiencing food differently when it is labelled as McDonald's, adults enjoying wine more when they believe it is expensive, and people finding others more attractive based on their beliefs about their gender and age, he shows how our perceptions and beliefs shape our experiences. He also discusses the impact of personal history and emotional connections on our valuation of objects and behaviours, highlighting the value of irreplaceable objects for individuals and demonstrating how people are willing to pay more for objects owned by people they admire.

In this section of the video, Paul Bloom discusses how history and context can affect the value of certain items, such as art or music. Bloom argues that the value of an artwork is rooted in assumptions about the human performance underlying its creation and that an original is worth more because it has a specific history. He uses Jackson Pollock as an example, explaining that people who like his art tend to believe that these works are difficult to create and require creative energy. Bloom also discusses Joshua Bell, a famous violinist, and how he conducted an experiment to determine how much people would like his music if they did not know they were listening to him. Finally, he mentions a pain experiment done by Kurt Gray and Dan Wegner, where undergraduates were given a series of painful electric shocks. Half of them were told that they were being given the shocks by someone in another room who doesn't know they're giving the shocks, causing the first shock to be recorded as very painful.

In this section, the speaker explains how the perception of pain can change based on the belief that the pain is inflicted intentionally. The belief that someone is causing the pain on purpose can make the pain feel worse as compared to when the pain is perceived as accidental. Interestingly, humans have the tendency to seek out mild pain in controlled situations and may even take pleasure from it. The speaker ends the talk by quoting a poem, emphasizing the role of the mind in transforming one's perception of reality.
