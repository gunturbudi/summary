# Summary of Is the world getting better or worse? A look at the numbers | Steven Pinker

Steven Pinker argues that progress is real and that by measurable standards of human well-being, people are leading better lives than ever before. He refutes the notion that the world is getting worse by comparing present-day global statistics with those of previous decades, showing reductions in poverty, violence, pollution, and nuclear weapons. Pinker acknowledges that negativity bias and the nature of news make it difficult for people to appreciate progress but emphasizes the importance of tackling problems as problems to be solved, not apocalypses in waiting. While human nature is susceptible to flaws, Pinker suggests that the resources of language, empathy, and rational faculties have been bolstered by norms and institutions of reason, leading to victories against the darker parts of human nature. Pinker calls for bringing the best of science, social science, and humanities to improve human well-being.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
In this section, Pinker refutes the notion that the world is getting worse by comparing present-day global statistics with those of 30 years ago. Americans kill each other at a far lower rate, have less poverty, and emit fewer pollutants than they did in 1988. Similarly, the world has fewer wars, fewer dictatorships, less extreme poverty, and fewer nuclear weapons than it did just a few decades earlier. Pinker argues that intellectuals, and those who call themselves progressive, hate the idea of progress, which is a testable hypothesis based on measurable human factors such as life, health, prosperity, peace, freedom, safety, knowledge, leisure, and happiness. By these standards, humans are leading dramatically better lives than at any point in history.

In this section, Pinker describes the progress that has been made in health, wealth, safety, knowledge, and leisure over the past several centuries. He explains that, despite setbacks and tragedies that still occur, the world has made great strides in reducing famine, poverty, violence, illness, and illiteracy, resulting in increases in happiness worldwide. Pinker acknowledges that people may not appreciate progress because of cognitive biases that cause people to focus on negative events and make them easier to recall from memory, as well as because of the nature of news, which is typically about things that happen rather than things that don't.

In this section, Steven Pinker discusses how the news capitalizes on people's morbid interest in what can go wrong, and therefore the world may always appear to be coming to an end. He argues that progress is not inevitable and that progress is a result of human efforts governed by an idea, which is to apply reason and science to enhance human well-being. However, it's essential to tackle problems as problems to be solved, not apocalypses in waiting. Pinker advocates that human nature, channeled by Enlightenment norms and institutions, is both the problem and the solution. This may be difficult to replicate on a large scale, but the ideals of the Enlightenment can be a stirring narrative.

In this section, Steven Pinker acknowledges that human nature is susceptible to a variety of flaws such as illusions, self-centeredness, and stupidity. However, he also recognizes that humans are endowed with significant resources, including the power of language, an aptitude for empathy, and the ability to combine ideas recursively. Moreover, our puny rational faculties have been bolstered by norms and institutions of reason, intellectual curiosity, skepticism, and the burden of proof. As a result of this, we eke out victories against the forces that grind us down, including the darker parts of our nature. Pinker suggests that we are living longer, learning more, getting smarter, and suffering less. While much suffering remains, ideas for reducing it have been voiced, and an infinite number of others are yet to be conceived. The challenge is to bring the best of our knowledge from science, social science, and the humanities to bear on improving human wellbeing.
