# Summary of The mathematician who cracked Wall Street | Jim Simons

Jim Simons, a former code-cracker at the National Security Agency (NSA), went on to become a mathematician and collaborated with Shiing-Shen Chern on the creation of the Chern-Simons invariants, which found wide applications in physics. Simons then transitioned to finance and founded Renaissance Technologies, where he applied mathematics to invest in the stock market. He gathered a team of mathematicians, gathered huge amounts of data, and simulated different predictive schemes using machine learning to find anomalies, leading to successful and low-risk returns. Simons also discusses his interest in philanthropy, focusing on promoting teaching math and science and researching the origins of life. He concludes by emphasizing the importance of science and math in achieving incredible accomplishments.

In this section, Jim Simons talks about his experience working for the National Security Agency (NSA), where he worked as a code-cracker until he was fired for writing a letter to The New York Times expressing his views against the Vietnam War. After that, he went on to Stony Brook and worked with the great mathematician Shiing-Shen Chern, doing good mathematics that started a subfield and eventually applied to physics, which Simons did not expect nor know anything about. The work they did together led to the creation of the Chern-Simons invariants that have been widely used across various fields in physics. Jim Simons expresses amazement at the unpredictable and inexplicable ways mathematics can be applied in the real world.

In this section, Jim Simons discusses the mathematical concept of the Euler characteristic, which he calls a topological invariant, and its applications in algebraic topology and geometry. He explains how this idea led to his own work in higher-dimensional theory and invariants. Simons also talks about his transition from mathematics to finance, and how he assembled a team of mathematicians to model financial data and create algorithms, leading to successful and low-risk returns at Renaissance Technologies.

In this section, Jim Simons explains how trend-following trading used to work in the old days, where commodities or currencies would trend in periods, and predicting by the average move in the past could make some money. However, since trend-following wasn't favorable anymore by the 80s, Simons and his team found other approaches by gathering a tremendous amount of data and hiring very smart people. They also simulated different predictive schemes using machine learning and looked at everything, including weather, annual reports, political opinions, and historic data. They take in terabytes of data a day and look for anomalies. Although these anomalies may seem random, it is possible to tell that it's not after analyzing them for a long time. Jim Simons also shares his thoughts on the hedge fund industry and how it hasn't done especially well in the last few years.

In this section, Jim Simons discusses the hedge fund industry's fees, stating that at one point, his hedge fund, Renaissance, charged investors five percent fixed fee and 44 percent of profits. However, Simons believes that the hedge fund industry is not a major cause for concern due to its small size, and that science has actually improved the investing world. Simons now focuses on philanthropic issues with his wife, Marilyn, and their foundation has a vision to focus on math and science to invest in basic research. In particular, they work to promote teaching math and science by identifying and celebrating the best teachers, rather than berating the worst ones, giving them extra income, support, and coaching. Additionally, they invest in the origins of life through research in the geology to biology pathway and questions regarding viable materials for life to emerge.

In this section, Jim Simons discusses the possibility of life in the universe and his personal interest in finding an answer to how life came to be. He acknowledges that while it's possible that there may be life all around us given the building blocks, it's uncertain as to how tortuous the path from those building blocks is to life. He adds that despite this uncertainty, he would love to know the answer to this question. The segment ends with a discussion on the role of science and math in our world and how taking knowledge seriously can lead to incredible accomplishments.
