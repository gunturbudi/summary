# Summary of The case for optimism on climate change | Al Gore

Al Gore discusses how climate change is affecting the Earth and how humans are causing it. He talks about how the insurance industry is noticing the losses mounting up and how the situation is dire. He argues that the situation is dire and that action must be taken to stop the worst effects of climate change.

Al Gore discusses the effects of climate change on the Earth, explaining that the sky is not the vast and limitless expanse that appears when we look up from the ground, and that the sky is a very thin shell of atmosphere surrounding the planet that is the open sewer for our industrial civilization as it's currently organized. He goes on to say that we are spewing 110 million tons of heat-trapping global warming pollution into it every 24 hours, free of charge, go ahead, and that the most important factor in trapping the extra heat energy is in the oceans. Fourteen of the 15 of the hottest years ever measured with instruments have been in this young century, and the hottest of all was last year. These higher temperatures are having an effect on animals, plants, people, ecosystems, but the majority of the global heat energy is trapped in the oceans.

The video discusses how global warming is causing more extreme weather events, such as Super Typhoon Haiyan which went over areas of the Pacific five and a half degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal before slamming into Tacloban, and Pope Francis who made such a difference to this whole issue visiting Tacloban right after that. These record downpours are also causing historic floods and mudslides and are creating instability. The insurance industry has noticed the losses mounting up and causality requires a moment of discussion. We're used to thinking of linear cause and linear effect - one cause, one effect - but this is systemic causation and as the great Kevin Trenberth says, "All storms are different now. There's so much extra energy in the atmosphere, there's so much extra water vapor. Every storm is different now." This is causing many new, unforeseen consequences such as the extinction crisis and the Zika epidemic.

Al Gore discusses the various aspects of climate change, highlighting the dangers posed to human life, infrastructure, and the economy by the changing climate. He argues that the situation is dire and that action must be taken to stop the worst effects of climate change. Gore calls for a shift in perspective from partisanship to a unified effort to address the crisis. He notes that the cost of climate change is mounting, and the energy sector is starting to move towards cheaper and more effective solar and wind technology. He also discusses energy storage, which is starting to become more cost-effective as the technology improves.

Al Gore discusses how he is optimistic about the climate change crisis and how the private sector is outpacing the public sector in solving the problem. He also talks about how the cost of renewables, such as solar and wind, has come down much faster than expected, and how low-income countries are benefiting the most from the technology. He ends the video by sharing a story about how NASA's mission control engineers were young when they heard about the challenge of landing a person on the Moon and how their age at the time helped make the project a success.

00:20:00
Al Gore discusses how progress in the fight against climate change has been slow at times, but that it is constantly being made and that the future of the planet depends on it. He also talks about how the fight is nonpartisan and how the people in the audience will be instrumental in winning it.

Al Gore discusses the importance of optimism in the face of climate change and how reason can help people win the day.
