Sheena Iyengar discusses how the American view of choice, which assumes that more choices leads to better choices, is not universally true. She interviews first-generation immigrant children in the United States and Eastern Europe, who all show that choice is more than just a one-time decision, and that it is important to defer to the preferences of those you trust and respect.

Sheena Iyengar discusses how Americans are raised to think that more choices are always better, which can lead to problems such as over-choice and overwhelm. She also discusses how Eastern Europeans are raised to not have choice, and how this can lead to problems such as lack of oxygen to the brain in a situation like Barbara Mitchell's. Americans are beginning to realize that unlimited choice is not as good as it seems, and that some people are simply not able to process all the choices they are presented with.

Sheena Iyengar discusses how her blindness affects her study of choosing, noting that many choices are visual and that she relies on others to help her make decisions. She does an experiment in which she strips the labels off of two bottles of nail polish and asks women to choose which they like better. Half of the women accused her of being a trickster, while the other half of the women were able to tell the polish apart based on the stripped labels.
