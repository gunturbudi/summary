The video discusses the concept of executive function, which is the ability to control one's thoughts, emotions, and actions in order to achieve goals. Executive function is critical for many aspects of life, but can be impaired in various ways, including through brain training apps and computer games. The presenter shows a task that measures executive function in children, and demonstrates that even young children who struggle with the task often succeed when they are given a different game to play instead. The presenter argues that executive function is best improved by understanding how it is influenced by context, and by practicing it in contexts that are relevant to real-world situations.
