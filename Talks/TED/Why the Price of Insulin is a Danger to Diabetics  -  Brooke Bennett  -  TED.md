She shares that she is fortunate enough to have insurance, but there is a lingering fear of aging off her parents' insurance and not being able to afford her insulin. Insulin rationing is a dangerous reality for many diabetics who cannot afford their medication and have to skip doses or take less than they need.

In this section, the speaker recounts the story of Alec Smith, who died from diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) after being unable to purchase insulin due to its high cost. She details the expense of diabetes equipment and supplies, including a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). Despite the crucial role that the CGM and insulin pumps play in monitoring blood sugar levels, the speaker notes that they are considered luxuries and that the puncture wounds and scars from years of using them are a constant reminder of the physical toll of diabetes. Even with proper use, equipment malfunctions can lead to painful needle insertions and the need to start the process all over again.
