# Summary of Rory Sutherland: Perspective is everything

In this video, Rory Sutherland discusses how perspective is everything, and how it can be used to solve problems that we didn't even realize were problems. He cites the example of toll crossings in Britain, and how the introduction of an economically efficient solution, which allows people to pay twice as much money but go through a faster lane, can be seen as being popular and affectionate rather than bastardy.

Rory Sutherland argues that the distinction between value created by cooking food and sweeping the floor is arbitrary and wrong. He suggests that the best way to create value is to be realistic about what we can realistically achieve and focus on improving the quality of the experience for the customer, rather than trying to change the reality.
