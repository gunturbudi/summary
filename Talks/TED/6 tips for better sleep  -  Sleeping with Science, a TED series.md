In this section, six scientifically based tips for better sleep are presented. The first is regularity: go to bed and wake up at the same time since deep inside our brains, we have a 24-hour master clock that thrives on regularity. The second tip is temperature: set a room temperature of around 65°F since our bodies and brains need to reduce their core temperatures to initiate and maintain sleep. The third tip is darkness: too much artificial light in the evening fails to trigger the release of melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate sleep. Fourth is to walk it out: don’t remain bed-bound awake for an extended period. Fifth is to limit the intake of alcohol and caffeine since they greatly impact sleep. Finally, establish a wind-down routine before sleep, which will help your brain gradually descend to the firm bedrock of good sleep.
