# Summary of 3 Skills Every Middle School Boy Needs | Jerome Hunter | TED

Jerome Hunter, founder of a middle school for boys, has identified three essential skills that boys need to learn in order to redefine their masculinity. These skills are confidence, communication, and community. Hunter believes that teaching healthy confidence, comfortable communication, and support for diverse communities can guide boys towards a more holistic version of masculinity that encourages both strength and empathy, autonomy and connection, and individualism with a sense of community. Through cross-curricular work, gratitude journals, breathwork, and appreciations, the school teaches and models healthy forms of communication. The goal is to teach boys that they don't have to fit into a stereotype of masculinity and that there is a better future where confidence, communication, and community are valued.

In this section, Jerome Hunter, founder of a middle school for boys, talks about his experience with middle schoolers and how he identified three critical skills that can help redefine masculinity. These skills are confidence, communication, and community. Hunter believes that having a healthy and balanced confidence is important to teach in middle school as it allows boys to feel good about who they are and move away from either-or thinking. The second skill, communication, helps boys become better listeners and be comfortable expressing emotions. The third skill, community, focuses on teaching boys to understand and support each other as well as appreciate diversity. Hunter believes that these three skills can help middle school boys take a different path and lead society to a more just and equitable future.
