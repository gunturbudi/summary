This video is about a mother who was conducting a focus group in a refugee camp in Syria. The focus group was discussing how to help children who have been traumatized by the war. One mother suggested distributing parenting information leaflets via bread wrappers, and this idea was successfully implemented. The leaflets were well-received by the families and 60% of the 3,000 families who received them responded. This demonstrates the importance of providing psychological first aid to families affected by the war.

A focus group with mothers in a war zone describes the challenges of raising children in a time of violence and displacement. Halul, the daughter of one of the mothers in the group, is 13 years old and has been living in a refugee camp since the war started. Her mother has completely withdrawn from her family, her children, and her husband. Halul is struggling to cope with the violence and displacement, and her family's struggles. The mothers in the group discuss the challenges of raising children in a time of war and how these challenges affect the children's development. They emphasize the importance of family support in helping children cope with these challenges.
