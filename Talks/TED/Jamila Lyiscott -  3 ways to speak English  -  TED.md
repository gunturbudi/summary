In this section, Jamila Lyiscott reflects on the concept of articulation and how it is perceived based on someone's race and ethnicity.

She argues that language should not be a means of discrimination because every language has its own rules and structure, and speaking broken English could contribute to linguistic diversity rather than promote ignorance.
