# Summary of Pamela Ronald: The case for engineering our food

In her video, "The case for engineering our food", plant geneticist Pamela Ronald highlights that virtually everything we eat has been genetically modified in some way. She uses examples from corn, bananas and different varieties of rice to illustrate this point. Ronald argues that genetic engineering is essential for ensuring food security and sustainable agriculture, citing examples of genetically engineered Sub1 rice that produces higher yields in flooded conditions and papaya engineered to resist ringspot virus. Ronald also addresses concerns regarding unintended consequences and claims that the process is no more risky than older methods of genetic modification. She counters arguments against GMOs, stating that nature is inherently chaotic and that science can be used to help alleviate human suffering and safeguard the environment.

In this section, plant geneticist Pamela Ronald explains that genetic modification is not new, as virtually everything we eat has been genetically modified in some manner. She provides examples, including the ancient ancestor of modern corn and banana, and explains how breeders have used different genetic techniques to create different varieties. Ronald also shares her own work on engineering a gene for immunity to a very serious bacterial disease in rice and her colleague’s discovery of an ancient variety that could withstand two weeks of submergence. These findings could help millions of rice farmers worldwide, especially in areas affected by flooding.

In this section, Pamela Ronald discusses the impact of genetic engineering on food security and sustainable agriculture. She uses the example of Sub1 rice, which was genetically engineered using a new gene called Sub1, and produced three and a half times more grain than the conventional variety after a 17 day flood. Ronald also discusses the benefits of genetic engineering for controlling crop diseases, like papaya ringspot virus, which nearly wiped out the Hawaiian papaya industry in the 1950s. She notes that the genetically engineered papaya carries only a trace amount of the virus, and is a safer alternative to organic or conventional methods. Lastly, Ronald discusses how genetic engineering can be used to control pests that devastate entire crops, and eliminate the need for harmful insecticides.

In this section, Pamela Ronald responds to arguments against GMOs that revolve around complexity and unintended consequences. She acknowledges that nature is complex, but states that genetic engineering has been used for over 40 years with no cases of harm to human health or the environment. Ronald emphasizes that after 20 years of rigorous peer review by thousands of independent scientists, every major scientific organization in the world has concluded that genetically engineered crops are safe to eat and the process of genetic engineering is no more risky than older methods of genetic modification. Ronald argues that we should focus on how we can use scientific innovation to help alleviate human suffering and safeguard the environment.

In this section, Pamela Ronald discusses the commercial aspects of genetically modified crops, stating that farmers in the developed world buy seed produced by seed companies, but in the less developed world, the seed is distributed for free. She argues against conspiracy theories, asserting that the seed is openly distributed and not part of a plan to force addiction. Ronald also highlights the higher risk of unintended consequences associated with older “crazy” methods of mutating plants, compared to modern gene-editing technologies. She notes that there is no such thing as “pure” food and that nature is a chaotic interplay of genetic changes.
