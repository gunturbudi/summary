In this section, Amanda Burden discusses how public spaces are integral to the functioning of a city, and how these spaces have undergone transformative changes. She cites her study of Paley Park, a small but comfortable and green public space in midtown Manhattan, which attracted people due to its comfortable movable chairs and greenery. However, she notes that many public spaces in cities are not designed with people in mind, and instead feature desolate and dangerous plazas that are wasteful and avoidable. Burden believes that being a city planner allows her to create meaningful public spaces while also fighting commercial interests that conflict with the common good.

In this section, Amanda Burden describes her experience of leading a team of planners at Battery Park City, Manhattan, on building a high-quality public open space. She also talks about how New York was projected to grow from eight to nine million people, and when she was put in charge of shaping the entire city of New York, she was faced with the challenge of finding housing for that many new people. By listening to communities and walking their streets to understand their DNA, she realized that she needed to redo the zoning and reshape the entire city to target where new development could go and prohibit any development in suburban-style neighborhoods to handle the population increase.

In this section, Amanda Burden discusses her mission to create great public spaces in New York City, and how she achieved this through zoning and park development. She transformed abandoned waterfronts into magnificent parks with tree-lined paths, plantings, and seating, which changed New Yorkers' image of their city. Burden emphasizes that creating a successful public space is not about design expertise, but tapping into one's humanity and creating a place where people want to be. She showcases examples of reclaimed public spaces such as pop-up cafes and the High Line, a self-seeded landscape on an elevated railway that she saved from demolition and turned into a beloved public park.

In this section, speaker Amanda Burden talks about the popular public space in New York known as the High Line and how developers proposed to disassemble it to build shops in the area to generate more money for the city. However, she emphasizes that commercial interests should not battle public spaces and that a city must take the long view for the common good. Public spaces need vigilant champions to claim them for public use, design them for the people that use them, and maintain them to ensure that they are for everyone. Public space can transform how people live in a city, how they feel about the city, and it is the main reason why people stay in a city.
