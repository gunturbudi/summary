# Summary of How much sleep do you really need? | Sleeping with Science, a TED series

According to the Center for Disease Control, adults require a minimum of seven hours of sleep each night, with studies showing that closer adherence to this requirement leads to lower mortality rates. It's important to note that while poor sleep quality and unmeasured diseases/illnesses could cause a person to sleep longer, once someone surpasses nine hours of sleep, their risk for mortality actually increases. Sleep is essential and should be given priority for individuals to live longer, healthier lives.

In this section of the video, the recommended amount of sleep for adults is discussed, with the Center for Disease Control in the United States stating a minimum of seven hours per night. Epidemiological studies have shown that the closer you get to the recommended amount of sleep, the lower your mortality risk, but it's not a linear relationship. Once you pass nine hours of sleep, mortality risk actually starts to rise. This could be due to unmeasured disease or illness, causing people to sleep longer, or poor sleep quality, which is also associated with a higher risk of death. Sleep is important and should be prioritized to reap its benefits and live longer.
