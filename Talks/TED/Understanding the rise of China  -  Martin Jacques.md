# Summary of Understanding the rise of China | Martin Jacques

Martin Jacques explains in this video how China is a "civilization-state" and its rise will have a significant impact on the world. Unlike Western nations which prioritize individual freedoms, democracy, and nation-states, China prioritizes unity and the maintenance of its civilization, which has existed for over two millennia. The state in China holds more authority and legitimacy, and is given a special status due to its role in maintaining Chinese civilization. The speaker argues that the West needs to understand and shed its arrogant and ignorant perceptions of China to be able to predict its future. He also notes the impact of China's rise on the democratization of the world and urges a positive attitude towards the changing world.

In this section, it is noted that the rise of China will fundamentally change the world, as the country will have the largest economy in the world in just a decade's time. And for the first time in modern history, the dominant country will not be from the West, but rather from a vastly different civilization, which will remain different even as it develops. The speaker argues that China is not really a nation-state, but rather a civilization-state, with the sense of what it is to be Chinese coming from a history of over two millennia, rather than the last hundred years. Furthermore, China is noted to be extremely diverse and pluralistic, which is often overlooked.

In this section, Martin Jacques explains that China is a civilization-state rather than a nation-state, which has significant implications. The Chinese prioritize unity and the maintenance of their civilization, rather than individual freedoms or democracy. This is reflected in their handling of Hong Kong and their approach to race, as over 90% of the population identify as Han Chinese. The state in China holds more authority and legitimacy than any Western state, regardless of their lack of democracy. The state's power is given a special status due to its long history of maintaining Chinese civilization, making it more important than individual freedoms.

In this section, the speaker explains that the Chinese state holds a spiritual role as a representative of Chinese civilization and has not faced significant challenges to its power in contrast to the continuous historical power struggles in Europe and North America. The Chinese view the state as the head of the family and its authority flows into many areas of society, including the economy, infrastructure, and society-wide targets like the one-child policy. Despite this, the Chinese market is not a new concept, and China's view of the state as omnipresent is embedded in society. The speaker argues that understanding China requires shedding Western perceptions and adopting a new kind of paradigm. The speaker identifies two reasons behind the West's perception of China: arrogance and ignorance towards difference, which hinder accurate predictions of China's future.

In this section, the speaker discusses the West's lack of understanding of other cultures and civilizations and how this will become more problematic as the developing world becomes more influential. The speaker highlights the increasing influence of East Asia, which is shaping the world at a rapid pace, and how the West is losing its influence as a result. He also notes that Europe is becoming increasingly out of touch with the world and urges a big-picture positive attitude towards the rapidly changing world, which will be shaped by cultures and histories that we are not yet familiar with.

In this section, the speaker highlights the rise of China and its impact on the democratization in the world. He says that China and other countries including India, Indonesia, and Brazil that make up a significant portion of the world's population have democratized the central voice in the world. The speaker expresses that cultures and civilizations, which had no representation before, will now have a different kind of recognition. He also sheds light on the prosperous history of China by comparing the size of the ships used during early voyages and the silk scroll made by ZhuZhou in 1368, which he humorously noted had depicted what appears to be the game of golf.
