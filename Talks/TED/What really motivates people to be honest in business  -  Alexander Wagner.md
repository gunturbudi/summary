# Summary of What really motivates people to be honest in business | Alexander Wagner

The speaker highlights the prevalence and cost of fraud in business, but notes that the majority of companies remain honest despite temptations. The two conflicting visions of human behavior, Adam Smith's idea of self-interest and scientific research on group benefits, are discussed, as well as economic motivations for honesty such as reputation. An experiment is used to test whether people are motivated by intrinsic values or incentives, with results suggesting intrinsic values may play a role. The concept of protected values, which people are willing to pay a price to uphold, is also discussed, and the speaker suggests selecting people with the right values rather than relying on incentives for honesty.

In this section, the speaker highlights the startling statistic that one out of seven large, public corporations commit fraud every year, costing shareholders and society around 380 billion dollars per year. However, he also notes that six out of seven companies remain honest despite temptations. The speaker then discusses two visions on human behaviour, one being Adam Smith's idea that if everyone behaves based on their self-interest, it is ultimately good for everyone, and the other being scientific research that suggests humans should behave in ways that benefit the group as a whole. The economic motivation for honesty, such as a code of conduct and reputation, is also discussed.

In this section, the speaker discusses the two perspectives of people's motivations: one being that people act with moral integrity independent of consequences, and the other being that people are incentivized by benefits and costs. To test this, an experiment was conducted where subjects were asked to flip a coin and report if it landed on tails, with each tails response resulting in a five-franc payment. While some participants reported four tails, a statistically unlikely outcome, around 65 percent of participants left money on the table by not reporting a tails outcome. The results suggest that people may be motivated by intrinsic values rather than just incentives.

In this section, the speaker discusses the concept of protected values, which are values that an individual is willing to pay a price to uphold. In essence, people feel better when they earn money in a manner that is consistent with their values. According to the speaker, people who have a set of protected values one standard deviation above the average are willing to discount money they receive by lying by about 25 percent, indicating their intrinsic motivation towards honesty. The speaker suggests that organizations should aim to select people with the right values rather than having people and then putting incentives in place since selecting the right individuals with the appropriate values can save time and money in the long run, and appeal to commercial incentives may not always be effective.
