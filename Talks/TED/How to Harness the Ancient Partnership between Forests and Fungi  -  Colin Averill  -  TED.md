# Summary of How to Harness the Ancient Partnership between Forests and Fungi | Colin Averill | TED

Colin Averill discusses the role of fungi in forests and how managing this relationship can lead to improved forest health. He explains how DNA sequencing is helping to reveal the complex interactions between fungi and forests, and how this knowledge can be used to improve management of these ecosystems.

Colin Averill discusses how forests and fungi work together to regulate the earth's climate and how research has progressed to reveal what a healthy forest microbiome looks like. He goes on to talk about the human microbiome project and how it has helped to identify combinations of bacteria that are linked to a variety of health conditions. He ends the talk by discussing how soil microbiome research is progressing, and how we are getting closer to understanding what a healthy forest microbiome looks like for plants as well as people.

In this talk, Colin Averill discusses how the human microbiome project approach can be applied to forests, and how this can lead to the discovery of patterns in forest health that are not driven by specific species or strains, but instead by a diverse and complex community of fungi. By manipulating and reintroducing fungal biodiversity into forests, Beyond just these carbon and climate outcomes, the talk suggests, we may be able to manage and even rewild these landscapes in a way that is both productive and resilient.
