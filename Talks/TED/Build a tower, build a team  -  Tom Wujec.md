Tom Wujec discusses the value of prototyping in relation to the marshmallow challenge, which he describes as a tool that helps teams identify the hidden assumptions behind projects. He argues that by creating a shared experience and working together to build a prototype, teams can turn "uh-oh" moments into "ta-da" moments.
