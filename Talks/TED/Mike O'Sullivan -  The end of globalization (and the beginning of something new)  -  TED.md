# Summary of Mike O'Sullivan: The end of globalization (and the beginning of something new) | TED

In this TED Talk, Mike O'Sullivan discusses the end of globalization and the emergence of a new world order based on shared values rather than geography or economics. He notes that the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the weaknesses of global collaboration and highlights the tensions between countries with differing values, such as the US and China. O'Sullivan believes that collaboration between countries with shared values will become increasingly important and highlights examples of countries working together, such as Scotland, Iceland, and New Zealand collaborating under the Wellbeing Economy Governments initiative. He also discusses the rise of state-controlled economic models in China and the risks associated with such models, such as prolonged unemployment. Additionally, O'Sullivan emphasizes the importance of countries learning from one another, particularly in areas such as battling corruption through technology, building education and healthcare systems, and making their voice heard on the world stage. He sees the promise of the new world order in the young populations and scope of fast-growing economies.

In this section, the speaker reflects on the end of globalization, which was marked by inequality and high levels of indebtedness. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed the frailties of the globalized world order and the lack of collaboration amongst countries in times of crisis. The new world order will be characterized by distinct and different ways of doing things based on values, rather than economic goals and geography. The speaker suggests that this new world order is a work in progress, and we are currently experiencing a period of "disorder" as we drift apart and reform. The internet is an example of a global system breaking apart due to values-based regional differences, such as the contrasting views of America and China towards tech innovation and the internet.

In this section, O'Sullivan explores the ways in which shared values rather than geography will increasingly shape destinies and alliances. He uses examples such as three small countries (Scotland, Iceland, and New Zealand) collaborating under the Wellbeing Economy Governments initiative, as well as the tension between Brussels and countries like Hungary and Poland that are increasingly going against shared European values. O'Sullivan also notes the distinct set of values held by China, which are deeply rooted in its history and reflect a desire to regain its historically dominant economic position. As rival ideologies drive distinct ways of doing things, collaboration between countries with shared values will become increasingly important.

In this section, Mike O'Sullivan talks about the rise of the state-controlled economic model in China, which has worked well for the country but comes with its own set of risks, such as prolonged unemployment. He also discusses the partnership that other countries have formed with China through the Belt and Road program, such as Pakistan and Sri Lanka, where they are now beholden to Chinese technologies and investors. He then highlights the many exciting things happening in fast-growing economies and the greater choice they have in the path they choose to follow. O'Sullivan encourages countries to compare notes on how to battle corruption through technology, build education and healthcare systems for their populations, and make their voice heard on the world stage. He believes that these countries, their young populations, and the scope they have to build new societies are the future and promise of the new world order.
