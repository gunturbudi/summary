Detail Summary:

In this section of the video, Jon M. Chu, a filmmaker and director of "Step Up 2: The Streets," talks about his experience joining the underground street culture of hip-hop dancers during the filming of the movie. He describes how dancers have used the internet and social networking to create a global laboratory where they can build on each other's moves and create new dance styles. Chu believes that through technology and online videos, even the world's greatest dancers of tomorrow can be discovered, and this has led him to create the "Legion of Extraordinary Dancers" (LXD), a group of dancers that believe dance can transform the world. He introduces some of the LXD heroes and their unique dance styles.

In this section, three dancers from The LXD share their perspectives on how dancing evolves in the internet age. J Smooth talks about how he visualizes lines and moves them in his mind, similar to how panels open and fold like Transformers. Kid David explains that when he dances, it's not a conscious effort but more like his body reacting to the music, and he was named Kid David because he was younger than the rest of the dancers. L'il C encourages dancers to create a ball of energy in their moves instead of throwing it out, and then manipulate and tame it.
