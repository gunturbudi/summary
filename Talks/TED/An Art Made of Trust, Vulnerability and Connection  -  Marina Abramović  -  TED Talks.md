In this section, Marina Abramović describes her 1974 performance art piece called "Rhythm 0," where she stood motionless while audience members were invited to interact with her with 76 objects ranging from pleasurable items like a rose to potentially fatal ones like a pistol with a bullet. The audience was initially gentle but quickly escalated to violence, with one person even putting the pistol to her head. Abramović uses her performances to confront common human fears like pain, suffering, and mortality in front of audiences, creating a dialogue and a shared experience.

In this section, artist Marina Abramović describes her 12-year relationship with fellow artist Ulay, whom she fell in love with and performed with for 12 years. Their relationship ultimately came to an end when they walked the Great Wall of China, each walking 2.5 thousand kilometers to meet in the middle to say goodbye. This experience changed how Abramović sees the public and inspired her to create the performance art piece, "Balkan Baroque," meant to evoke the idea that war is always happening somewhere. Abramović also talks about her MoMA performance piece, where she sat silently in a chair, with an empty chair in front where visitors could sit with her and look into her eyes. This experience inspired her to create an institute of immaterial performing arts in Hudson, upstate New York.

Through activities like slow walking, drinking water, and even counting rice, the institute encourages visitors to find simplicity and inner peace. Abramović argues that personal changes like these are necessary to effect greater change in the world, and she challenges the audience to connect with a stranger by looking into their eyes for two full minutes as a way of fostering trust, vulnerability, and connection.
