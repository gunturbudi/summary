The Shared Experience of Absurdity video features a woman who is the star of the 2002 video of a No Pants Subway Ride in New York City. The video then goes on to show other participants in the ride as they enter and exit the train. The woman then laughs when she realizes that the two Danish men sitting next to her are laughing at her. This video inspires Charlie Todd to start Improv Everywhere, a website and YouTube channel that has annually hosted the No Pants Subway Ride.

In the video, Charlie Todd discusses his projects "Look Up More" and "High Five". The first project consisted of 70 actors dressing in black and staging an unauthorized performance in Union Square Park. The second project was inspired by a high school student who wrote to Todd asking him to stage an event where people would dress in blue polo shirts and khaki pants and go shopping at a Best Buy. Todd organized the event and gave high fives to 2,000 people in just one morning.
