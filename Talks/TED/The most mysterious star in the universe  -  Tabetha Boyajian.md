# Summary of The most mysterious star in the universe | Tabetha Boyajian

In this video, Tabetha Boyajian discusses the discovery of KIC 8462852, a mysterious star with unusual dips in its light curve. These dips were not circular and were much larger than expected, with the brightness of the star dropping over 20 percent. Various theories, such as planets colliding or a swarm of comets, were proposed to explain the dips, but the possibility of an alien megastructure, specifically a Dyson sphere, gained widespread attention and sparked intense interest in the star. Boyajian explains the concept of Dyson spheres, and notes that although they do not defy the laws of physics, the lack of heat production in this case suggests that another explanation might be necessary. More research is needed to understand the mysteries of KIC 8462852 and the universe as a whole.

In this section, astronomer Tabetha Boyajian explains how data from NASA's Kepler mission led to the discovery of KIC 8462852, one of the most mysterious stars in our galaxy. Boyajian and her team launched a citizen science project called Planet Hunters to have people look at Kepler data, which led to the spotting of an anomalous signal coming from KIC 8462852. Rather than a smooth and clean U-shaped dip like the one observed with Jupiter, the dips in KIC 8462852â€™s light curve had a strange slope, which indicated that whatever was blocking the starlight was not circular like a planet. This star exhibited a whole 15 percent drop in light, compared to the one percent drop we'd expect from a planet.

In this section, the speaker describes the bizarre events observed on the star. There are various shapes and durations of dips in the light curve that can last for over a hundred days with up and down trends. This leads to the brightness of the star dropping over 20 percent, meaning there is something astrophysical getting in the way and blocking starlight. Various theories arose that could explain the light dips, including a young star with a birth cloud, planets colliding, or a large scrap of passing comets. After publishing a paper when comets seemed the most plausible theory and naming it "Where's The Flux?", a colleague proposed the possibility of aliens, which led to thousands of articles and intense interest in the star. The civilization that supposedly caused the dips was advanced and had exhausted their planet's energy, leading to them building a megastructure around their star to capture more.

In this section, Tabetha Boyajian explains the concept of Dyson spheres which are structures built by aliens around their host star to capture more energy to solve their energy needs. However, the existence of these structures does not defy the laws of physics, as anything that uses a lot of energy produces heat which we do not observe. One possible explanation for the dimming of the mysterious star is that we have witnessed an interplanetary space battle and the catastrophic destruction of a planet. Citizen scientists with their backyard telescopes have taken over to observe the star nightly and further research into this kind of phenomena is on the horizon with the hope that more data might reveal new discoveries and help us understand the mysteries of our universe.
