# Summary of 3 Elements of True Fun – and How to Have More of It | Catherine Price | TED

Catherine Price outlines the three elements of "true" fun: playfulness, connection, and flow. She describes the negative effects of “fake” fun, which can lead to passive consumption and social media addiction. To make space for true fun, Price suggests becoming more intentional, identifying and eliminating sources of fake fun, and pursuing passions and hobbies. Building regular “microdoses” and “booster shots” of fun into schedules create a framework that prioritizes fun. By keeping fun a priority, one can increase resilience, reduce stress, and improve social connections.

In this section, Catherine Price explains the three states that make up "true" fun—playfulness, connection, and flow—and how these states are interrelated. While some adults may see fun as frivolous, Price argues that incorporating fun activities into one’s life can increase resilience and energy, as well as reduce stress levels and provide a sense of social connection. Additionally, Price describes "fake fun" as products or services marketed as fun but that do not actually produce these three states. Social media and passive consumption are examples of "fake" fun.

In this section, Catherine Price discusses the three categories of fun, including true fun, fake fun, and the middle category that includes activities that are enjoyable but do not necessarily qualify as true fun. Additionally, she suggests becoming more intentional about how one uses leisure time by identifying sources of fake fun and eliminating them. She recommends thinking back on a moment of true fun, regardless of how small the experience was or how much money was spent. Price also offers SPARK, an acronym that includes clearing space, pinpointing fun magnets, arranging opportunities, recognizing connections, and keeping it up to help organize one's fun goals.

In this section, Catherine Price shares how to make space in your life for fun by creating boundaries around your commitments and giving yourself a permission slip to prioritize fun. Pursuing passions and hobbies is another way to create portals into flow and fun, and learning new skills makes life more interesting. Attracting fun can be achieved by being open and making others feel comfortable, tuning into a fun mindset that focuses on the positive, and engaging in little acts of rebellion, even if that means doing something delightful for someone else.

In this section, Catherine Price discusses how keeping fun as a priority in life is like exercise, in that it needs to be done regularly rather than just once. She suggests building "microdoses" and "booster shots" of fun into your schedule regularly to create a framework for a life that is conducive to fun. Fun audits can be used to review leisure activities and identify sources of fake fun and reduce or eliminate them, which is especially important when grappling with existential threats. Finally, Price suggests choosing the right people and finding groups that are already having fun to share in that joy.
