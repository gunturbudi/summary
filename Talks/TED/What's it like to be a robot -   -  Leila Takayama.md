Robots have the potential to help us do things faster and more efficiently, but can also be difficult to understand and work with. One such robot is Dallas, who worked remotely from his home in Indiana. Thanks to a special device called a "robot body part," Dallas and his coworker Curt were able to continue working together even when Dallas was unavailable.

In this video, Leila Takayama explains the process of remote collaboration, specifically in the context of robots. She states that, initially, people were uncomfortable with robots in the office, but over time, social norms evolved to accept them. One key benefit of remote collaboration with robots is that people start to feel like they're just there, and this can lead to less conflict and more productive interactions. In addition, robots can help us better understand human psychology, which is essential for creating successful artificial intelligence.
