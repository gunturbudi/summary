This video talks about the experience of being intersex, which is a variation of sex characteristics. Most people learn about this variation of sex only when they are adults, and many intersex people don't even know they are intersex. This can be a difficult experience, as doctors and other professionals who are supposed to be unbiased often have prejudices against intersex people. Many intersex people end up feeling that their bodies have been violated, and some attempt to take their own lives as a result. However, despite the challenges, many intersex people live successful, productive lives.

Susannah Temko discusses the difficulties and challenges faced by intersex people, who often have to conceal their variations from society. She goes on to talk about the current approach to intersex people, which is based on a now-debunked academic study from a man who believed that you could raise a child in any gender by changing their genitals. The approach also stems from referring to healthy intersex variations as abnormal or disordered. This makes sense, as it suggests there is a fix for these variations and they are not just "normal." Temko discusses how the current approach to intersex people is a result of colonialism and homophobia, and she is not here to say that the categories of men and women do not exist.
