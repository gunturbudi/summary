# Summary of Jennifer Aaker and Naomi Bagdonas: Why great leaders take humor seriously | TED

In their TED talk, Jennifer Aaker and Naomi Bagdonas explore the importance of humor in the workplace and how it can enhance leadership, creativity, and team bonding. They emphasize that humor is a teachable skill and reveal how laughter can shorten the path to connection by releasing endorphins, cortisol, and dopamine. However, to practice safe humor, we must be mindful of not making fun of someone of lower status and pay attention to how humor will make others feel. Laughing together can flood our brains with hormones associated with love, and incorporating humor can make a real difference in people's lives in the workplace.

In this section, Jennifer Aaker and Naomi Bagdonas explain how humor is a teachable skill and an underappreciated asset in the workplace, even though people tend to laugh less as they enter the workforce. They share a story of a non-profit CEO who used humor to create a moment of levity during a tense virtual offsite and explain how leadership with a good sense of humor can be seen as more motivating, leading to more creative and bonded teams. They also reveal that laughter can shorten the path to connection and disclose personal information, citing the release of endorphins, cortisol, and dopamine, which makes it similar to exercise, meditation, and sex combined. They suggest noticing what is true rather than looking for what is funny and share examples of how people find humor in their own lives, emphasizing that incorporating humor in the workplace can make a real difference in people's lives.

In this section, the speakers discuss how having a humorous outlook can change our perception in life. By living our lives on the precipice of a smile, we shift how we interact with the world, and in turn, how it interacts back. Moreover, being human at work, even in serious situations or missions, is crucial to inspire trust, and humor is not necessarily at odds with gravity but can give power to both. To practice safe humor, we must recognize it is not about us, asking ourselves, "How will this make other people feel?" and never punching down or making fun of someone of lower status. Laughing together paradoxically floods our brains with hormones associated with love, and humor can indeed bring more joy and love into our lives.
