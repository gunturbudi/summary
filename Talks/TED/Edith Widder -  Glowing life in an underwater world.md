# Summary of Edith Widder: Glowing life in an underwater world

This video discusses the work of Edith Widder, an engineer who specializes in deep sea exploration. Widder discusses the importance of bioluminescence in the ocean and how it can be used to learn more about the animals that produce it. She also shows how her work has helped to develop a deep sea webcam and a more mobile form of the system.

This video discusses the importance of bioluminescence in the ocean and its many uses. It features a number of examples of animals that use bioluminescence for various purposes, such as predator avoidance, mating, and communication. Some of the creatures featured in the video are blue light-emitting fish, red light-emitting fish, viperfish, anglerfish, and Christmas tree fish.

Edith Widder's video "Glowing life in an underwater world" follows deep sea shrimp that use bioluminescence to create a dazzling light show to distract predators, and other animals that use bioluminescence for various purposes. While the technology is not new, Edith's project to create an electronic jellyfish was a shoestring operation that relied on the help of friends and strangers. The moment when everything came together was captured on film and now hangs in the lab where it is a source of pride.
