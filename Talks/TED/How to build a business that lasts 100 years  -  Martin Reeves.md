# Summary of How to build a business that lasts 100 years | Martin Reeves

In his video, "How to build a business that lasts 100 years," Martin Reeves highlights the importance of resilience and longevity in both biology and business, citing the average lifespan of a US public company being only 30 years. Reeves turns to biology to examine the principles that make systems sustainable and adaptable, highlighting six principles that underpin the human immune system, the same principles that keep natural, social, and long-lived businesses functional. He provides examples of companies such as Toyota and Essilor that employ the principles of the immune system in their business practices to thrive in today's dynamic environment, and pushes for larger companies to think more biologically in order to survive and grow in the long term.

In this section, a product designer pitches the concept of the human immune system to a skeptical manager, named Bob. While the designer describes the system as being inefficient, complex, and overreactive, it also has several adaptive and modular features, making it virtually foolproof. Bob argues that efficiency is more important in the short term, but the drawback is that the user of this type of system would likely die within a week of encountering a new strain of the flu virus. The discussion highlights the importance of longevity and resilience in both biology and business, with the average US public company now having a lifespan of only 30 years and a 32 percent probability of not being around in five years.

In this section, Martin Reeves discusses how he turned to biology to look at what makes systems resilient and enduring, noting that the same six principles that underpin the human immune system also underpin natural and social systems, as well as long-lived businesses. He cites examples such as Kong≈ç Gumi, the world's oldest continuously operating company until it failed due to a lapse in prudence, and Fujifilm, which thrives due to diversification and adaptation. Reeves also shares the story of how Toyota was able to recover car production just five days after a catastrophic factory fire wiped out the only plant that supplied them with valves for car-braking systems.

In this section, Martin Reeves gives examples of companies that have used the principles of the biological immune system in their businesses. Toyota's collaborative management of its supply network allowed it to recover quickly from a catastrophic fire, while Essilor stays ahead of technology disruption by acquiring and developing new technologies. Reeves argues that companies need to start thinking biologically in addition to mechanically in order to thrive in today's unpredictable and dynamic environment. Every small entrepreneurial company naturally does so, but larger companies need to rejuvenate their ability to think biologically to survive and thrive in the long term.
