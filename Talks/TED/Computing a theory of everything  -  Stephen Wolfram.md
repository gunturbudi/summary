# Summary of Computing a theory of everything | Stephen Wolfram

Stephen Wolfram discusses the idea of computation as the biggest idea of the past century and how it has led to the development of computer technology. He explains his work on three large projects, including creating a structure based on symbolic programming to build Mathematica and the development of the knowledge engine, Wolfram Alpha. Wolfram Alpha combines precision with a vast knowledge-base and democratizes programming, leading to mass customized creativity. Wolfram explores the computational universe and how it might offer clues to the theory of everything in physics, finding candidate universes with simple rules that reproduce special and general relativity and hint at quantum mechanics. He envisions that computation will be the defining idea of our future, from the foundations of science to technology and the human condition.

In this section, Stephen Wolfram discusses the idea of computation as the single biggest idea in the past century, which has led to the development of computer technology. He talks about his work on three large projects that try to take the idea of computation seriously, including creating a whole structure based on symbolic programming to build Mathematica. Further, he explains the concept of a space of all possible programs and demonstrates how cellular automata can follow simple rules to produce complex structures. Wolfram suggests that this new kind of science is different and more general than mathematics-based science and provides insight into new issues like computational irreducibility, the principle of computational equivalence, the limits of science, and the questions of intelligence in the universe, free will, and creating technology.

In this section, Stephen Wolfram discusses the creation of Wolfram Alpha, a knowledge engine that computes answers to questions in real-time by using available public data and computing fresh new answers with built-in knowledge. Wolfram Alpha is a huge, long-term project that required the curation of a vast array of sources for facts and data, as well as the implementation of methods, models, algorithms, and natural language processing. Despite a monumental effort, Wolfram Alpha has been successful, with more than 80% of web queries being handled successfully the first time. The future of Wolfram Alpha is promising, and the technology is expected to show up in more and more places.

In this section, Stephen Wolfram explains how combining Mathematica's precise, formal language with the messiness and vast knowledge-base of Wolfram Alpha creates a powerful new tool. This democratizes programming and allows anyone to input plain language, which Wolfram Alpha can then interpret and create precise code for. This leads to the ability to harness the computational universe to create technology and new discoveries. Wolfram Alpha is brimming with algorithms that have been discovered by searching the computational universe, and this method of searching can also lead to mass customized creativity. Wolfram then ponders whether the simple rules that generate complex behavior in the computational universe could be the same for our physical universe, operating at an abstract and low level.

In this section, Stephen Wolfram discusses his exploration of the computational universe and how it might offer clues to the theory of everything in physics. He explains that every universe corresponds to a possible rule, but finding a candidate universe for our own is hindered by computational irreducibility. However, he has found candidate universes with simple rules that reproduce special and general relativity and offer hints of quantum mechanics. Wolfram admits that it is a challenging project but feels committed to finding the rule for our universe within this decade. He envisions that computation will be the defining idea of our future, from the foundations of science to technology and the human condition.
