# Summary of Jonas Eliasson: How to solve traffic jams

Jonas Eliasson discusses the effectiveness of incentivizing drivers to reduce rush hour driving to solve road congestion rather than dictating how they should behave. He cites Stockholm's example, where charging drivers at bottlenecks reduced rush hour traffic by 20%, leading to a significant decrease in congestion, and the public support for congestion pricing increasing to 70%. Eliasson believes that nudging people in the right direction away from rush hour driving creates more effective and accepted results.

In this section, Jonas Eliasson discusses the pervasiveness of road congestion and how traffic planners have tried to solve the problem by figuring out what people should do instead of rush hour car driving. Eliasson argues that creating incentives and allowing people to figure out how to adapt to the new framework of congestion is a much more effective solution. He uses Stockholm as an example, where charging drivers one or two euros at bottlenecks reduced rush hour traffic by 20%. Eliasson explains that once the congestion charges were introduced in 2006, the reduction in traffic led to a significant decrease in congestion, and even after they were reintroduced following a referendum in 2007, the low traffic levels remained.

In this section of the video, Jonas Eliasson talks about the surprising public support for congestion pricing in Stockholm after it was introduced. Initially, 70% of the population opposed congestion pricing when it was first introduced in 2006. However, as time went on, the number of drivers using roads reduced by 20% and the public support for congestion pricing increased to 70%. Eliasson attributes this to the "power of nudges" where people were not told how to adapt, but were nudged in the right direction away from rush hour driving in a way that people didn't even notice. Consequently, people embraced the change and even liked it.
