Elizabeth Gilbert discusses how her recent book success has made her question her ability to continue writing. She looks to ancient Greece and Rome for ideas on how to manage the anxiety and pressure of creativity and finds that the idea of a genius as a divine entity living in the walls of an artist's studio is a better model. She poses the question of why not adopt this model in the modern world, and concludes that it makes as much sense as any other explanation for the unpredictable nature of creativity.
