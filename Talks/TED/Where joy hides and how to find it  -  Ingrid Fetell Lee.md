# Summary of Where joy hides and how to find it | Ingrid Fetell Lee

Ingrid Fetell Lee, a designer, discusses her journey to discovering the aesthetic of joy and the tangible attributes that evoke it in physical objects, environments, and even ourselves. Through interviews, she discovered universal items that bring joy like cherry blossoms, bubbles, and hot air balloons, and explains how certain designers, artists, and architects incorporated the "aesthetics of joy" into their designs. Fetell Lee emphasizes the importance of prioritizing joy in our physical surroundings, particularly in places with vulnerable populations, and the positive impact it has on our well-being, citing examples like Publicolor, a non-profit which found that colorful environments improve student behavior and attendance. She also notes that color and shape can affect our moods and behavior, and that the drive towards joy is a fundamental part of the drive towards life.

In this section, the speaker recounts her journey to discover the relationship between physical objects and joy. After her professors at design school praised her work, saying it gave them joy, she became curious about how joy could be evoked by tangible objects. She discovered that joy is an intense momentary experience of positive emotion that makes a person want to jump up and down, unlike happiness which measures how good one feels over time. The speaker then interviewed people to discover the things that brought them joy, discovering that certain objects and experiences such as cherry blossoms, swimming pools, bubbles and hot air balloons were universally joyful.

In this section, the speaker talks about discovering the "aesthetics of joy" and how they can be accessed through tangible attributes. By recognizing these patterns of joy, she began seeing joyful moments everywhere and realized how much of our built environment lacks these attributes. The speaker then shares examples of designers, artists and architects who are creating joyful spaces and environments. She emphasizes how important it is to prioritize joy in our physical surroundings, particularly in places that house vulnerable populations, and how it can positively impact our well-being.

In this section, the speaker explains how color and shape can affect our mood and behavior. Publicolor, a non-profit organization, has found that schools that have been transformed with colorful paint have seen improvements in attendance and student behavior. Research from four countries also shows that people working in colorful offices are more alert, confident, and friendly. The use of color can be traced back to our evolution, where color meant a sign of life and energy, and abundance meant survival. People also tend to feel safer in buildings with curves, as opposed to sharp angles. The drive toward joy is, fundamentally, the drive toward life, and we should find ways to put ourselves on the path of joy more often.
