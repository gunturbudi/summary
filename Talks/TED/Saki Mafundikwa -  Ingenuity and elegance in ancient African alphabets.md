This Ethiopian cross illustrates the creative spirit in Africa, which is as potent as it has always been, if only designers could look within. Africans of antiquity created civilization, and their monuments, which still stand today, are a true testimony of their greatness. Most probably, one of humanity's greatest achievements is the invention of the alphabet, and that has been attributed to Mesopotamia with their invention of cuneiform in 1600 BC, followed by hieroglyphics in Egypt. This discovery is vindicated by the Wadi el-Hol inscriptions, which were discovered in the Thebes desert on the limestone cliffs in western Egypt in 1998. The last word goes to Marcus Mosiah Garvey and the Akan people of Ghana with their Adinkra symbol Sankofa, which encourages us to go to the past so as to inform our present and build on a future for us and our children.
