# Summary of Molly Stevens: A new way to grow bone

Molly Stevens is a bioengineer who works on creating replacement bone, amongst other things. In her presentation, she talks about some of the techniques used in her lab to regrow bone, including an entirely new approach using an in vivo bioreactor that allows stem cells to grow and become new bone on demand. She also discusses the challenges of scaffold-based approaches in different medical procedures and how her team has used hybrid structures to adjust materials for different needs. Finally, Stevens explores the application of these approaches to cardiovascular disease and how her team is working to develop materials that give implanted stem cells more information to regenerate dead tissue.

In this section, Stevens discusses the history of biomaterials and how they have been used in the body over time. She shares examples of physicians who were creative with materials, like Sir Harold Ridley, who discovered that part of the canopy of Spitfires were made of bioinert plastic, which he then proposed as a new material for intraocular lenses. Stevens explains that in modern regenerative medicine, the focus has shifted to using bioactive materials that can interact with the body and dissolve over time. She also discusses the importance of the environment for stem cells in order for them to become the correct specialized tissue, and how different tissues have different abilities to regenerate. Stevens notes that bone is quite good at repairing itself, which is why it is one of the tissues they focus on in their lab.

In this section, Molly Stevens talks about the limitations and painful aftereffects of the iliac crest harvest procedure for bone repair. She introduces a new method called the in vivo bioreactor approach that utilizes the body's stem cells on the outside of long bones to generate new bone on demand. The process involves injecting liquid that turns into a rigid gel, creating an artificial cavity next to the bone and stem cells. The stem cells proliferate to form new bone, which can be harvested and transplanted without causing significant pain. The procedure has received attention, including a strange request from American football players who wanted double-thickness skulls.

In this section, Dr. Molly Stevens discusses the need for scaffold-based approaches in certain medical procedures, and the importance of designing materials that are simple enough to use in a clinical setting. She also explains the hybrid structure of bone tissue and how her team has been able to tailor materials to recreate this structure and adjust it for different needs. She then turns her focus to the application of these approaches to cardiovascular disease and the challenge of getting implanted stem cells to regenerate dead tissue. Her team is exploring the development of materials that are not only conductive but also surround the cells in 3D, giving them more information and the ability to regenerate tissue.
