In this section, Jackson Katz discusses the problematic framing of gender violence as a women's issue, arguing that this view actually gives men an excuse not to pay attention to the issue. Katz also points out the confusion of the term "gender" and how it is often synonymous with "women's issues," while men are erased from the conversation about a subject that is primarily about them. He illustrates how language and sentence structure conspire to keep men out of the conversation, using an exercise from feminist linguist, Julia Penelope, to show how the focus shifts from John to Mary, ultimately victim-blaming Mary for what was done to her by John.

In this section, Jackson Katz highlights the importance of asking different questions when it comes to preventing violence against women. Rather than focusing on individual women, we should be asking what is going on with men and why so many men are perpetrating violence against women and children. Katz stresses that institutions such as religious belief systems, sports, pornography, and family structures are involved in producing abusive men at epidemic rates. He calls on men to be part of the solution by standing up against violence and speaking out, be it with or for women. Katz also introduces the bystander approach to gender-violence prevention, which involves encouraging people, particularly men, to intervene in situations where violence may occur.

In this section, Jackson Katz emphasizes the bystander approach that focuses on interrupting and challenging abusive behavior instead of seeing it in a binary fashion. He emphasizes the goal of getting men who are not abusive to challenge abusive men, not just during physical attacks but also every day like in situations where sexist comments or degrading behavior are present. Katz argues that if men who act in sexist ways start losing status, we'll see a radical decrease in abuse. Additionally, the responsibility of taking a stand should not fall on the shoulders of teenage or college men, but on adult men with power who should prioritize these issues as leadership issues. Lastly, he emphasizes the importance of leadership training over sensitivity training as an important distinction to make.

In this section, Jackson Katz emphasizes the importance of leadership in preventing domestic and sexual violence, specifically in college and university athletics. He stresses that there is no excuse for not having domestic and sexual violence prevention training mandated for all student athletes, coaches, administrators, and those in charge need to make this happen. Katz believes that the failure to act in many cases is due to men's leadership. He also mentions that there are pressures and constraints within peer cultures on men that must be broken through, and encourages more men to stand with women and not against them. Finally, he emphasizes that working together, men and women can begin to transform and create a better future for future generations.
