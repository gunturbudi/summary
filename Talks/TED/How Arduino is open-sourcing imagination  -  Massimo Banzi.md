# Summary of How Arduino is open-sourcing imagination | Massimo Banzi

Massimo Banzi, co-founder of Arduino, discusses how open-source hardware is creating a DIY community that collaborates online and across different spaces. By sharing hardware designs, individuals can build their own objects using open-source printers that anyone can access instructions to make. Banzi showcases various projects that have utilized the open-source platform, including a Geiger counter developed in Japan during the Fukushima disaster and a machine developed by the DIY bio community that processes DNA from scratch. Projects that have utilized Arduino include the Large Hadron Collider, assistive devices for those with disabilities, and creative projects like the Botanicalls, where an Arduino measures the well-being of a plant and creates a Twitter account to report its status. Banzi expresses gratitude towards the community for the success of Arduino and is amazed by the variety of fields in which it is applied.

In this section, Massimo Banzi explains how open-source hardware and the maker's movement are revolutionizing manufacturing. By using open-source printers that anyone can access the instructions to make, individuals can now manufacture their own objects. Banzi also talks about his own project, Arduino, an open-source project that powers the printer. It is incredibly user-friendly and allows anyone to build projects, even kids, who Banzi has seen really excel in their projects. By sharing hardware designs and allowing them to be modified and built upon, open-source hardware is becoming a piece of culture that the world can share and build upon.

In this section of the video, Massimo Banzi explains that the Arduino methodology is open-sourced under Creative Commons. The open-source hardware movement, championed by people like Ladyada and communities like Make, has given rise to a turbo-charged DIY community that collaborates online and across different spaces. Banzi illustrates the scope of Arduino projects by highlighting a few examples such as Matternet, who created drone transportation for African villages using open-source products, and the "Enough Already" Arduino project, which muted the TV anytime over-exposed personalities such as the Kardashians were mentioned. Arduino has been used for serious endeavours such as the Large Hadron Collider, assistive devices for those with disabilities, and creative pursuits such as the Botanicalls project, where an Arduino measures the well-being of a plant and creates a Twitter account to report its status.

In this section, Massimo Banzi, one of the co-founders of the Arduino project, showcases various projects and case studies that have utilized the open source platform, which include a Geiger counter developed in Japan during the Fukushima disaster, a machine developed by the DIY bio community that processes DNA from scratch, students in developing countries replicating scientific instruments at a fraction of the cost, and numerous other endeavors. Banzi also mentions that Google and other tech companies have utilized Arduino to create interfaces between mobile devices and the real world. He concludes by showcasing the Pebble smartwatch and the ArduSat project, a satellite that can upload experiments programmed with Arduino.

In this section, Massimo Banzi expresses his gratitude towards the community for the success of the Arduino project. He acknowledges that it is the work of many people who have enabled others to create great things using Arduino. Banzi says that he feels overwhelmed and amazed by the variety of fields in which Arduino is applied. Every morning he wakes up to see the Google Alerts and feels encouraged by the growth of the community.
