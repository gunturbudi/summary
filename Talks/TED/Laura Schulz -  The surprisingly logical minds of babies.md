# Summary of Laura Schulz: The surprisingly logical minds of babies

In this video, Laura Schulz discusses the surprisingly logical minds of babies. She notes that babies use statistical evidence to make decisions and that they are capable of processing large amounts of data. Schulz goes on to discuss the hierarchical nature of human knowledge and how it remains a challenge for researchers to understand.

Detail Summary:

In one experiment, Hyowon Gweon Squeezes three blue balls out of a box of mostly blue balls. In the other experiment, Laura Schulz shows babies a BOX OF YELLOW BALLS and squeezes out yellow balls. The only difference between the two conditions is the statistical evidence babies are going to observe. Babies in the yellow ball condition expect the balls to squeak as well.

In this video, Laura Schulz discusses how babies use statistical evidence to make decisions. For example, babies will more likely generalize evidence when it is plausibly representative of the population than when it is clearly cherry-picked. This is especially important when it comes to problems, such as trying to make a toy go, in which one possibility is that the baby is doing something wrong and the other is that there is something wrong with the toy.

In this video, Laura Schulz discusses the surprisingly logical minds of babies, noting that when babies see a toy that they can't make work, they will often give the toy to their mother in order to change the person instead. These findings suggest that the toy is not broken, but rather the person. Babies also have a choice between asking for help from their mother or exploring the toy.

Laura Schulz discusses how human minds are capable of amazing feats beyond what even the most powerful computers can achieve, such as generating new ideas and getting the world right.
