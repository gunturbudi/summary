# Summary of Pointing to the future of UI | John Underkoffler

John Underkoffler discusses the importance of inventing interfaces that operate based on "real world geometry" and highlights the Spatial Operating Environment as a design concept that allows for intuitive and natural interaction with computers. He also demonstrates TAMPER, an editing and media manipulation system, and believes that technology needs to be more generous in its application for creative endeavors. Underkoffler believes this technology should be available to all within five years and suggests that Oblong's early-adopter customers address logistical, supply chain, and financial issues through heavy data processing.

In this section, John Underkoffler discusses the advent of the Macintosh and how it revolutionized the way people interacted with computers. He highlights the fact that the interface and the operating system are inseparable and that the supporting technologies for computers have drastically increased in capacity over the past 25 years. However, he also points out that in the flurry of supporting technologies, the focus on inventing new interfaces has become a distraction. He advocates for the importance of "real world geometry" and for inventing interfaces that operate based on it. Examples of such interfaces include the Luminous Room and Urp.

In this section, John Underkoffler discusses the Spatial Operating Environment, a design concept that he and his team developed based on their work creating the interfaces used in the film "Minority Report." Using hand gestures to control six degrees of navigational freedom, users can fly around and manipulate 3D elements, making interaction with computers more intuitive and natural. This concept allows for collaboration and multiple displays, breaking away from the outdated notion of one machine per person. Underkoffler also demonstrates the use of this technology in a logistics system, combining traditional data with three-dimensional and geospatial information for more efficient operation.

In this section, John Underkoffler demonstrates TAMPER, an editing and media manipulation system, and asserts that technology needs to be more generous in its application for creation and art, and not just for corporations and movie producers. Underkoffler believes his technology should be available to all within the next five years, built into the bezel of every display as part of a standard computer interface. He suggests that Oblong's early-adopter customers do heavy data processing to address logistical, supply chain and financial issues. However, the company is still searching for a killer app.
