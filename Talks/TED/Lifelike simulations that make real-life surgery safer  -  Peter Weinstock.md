# Summary of Lifelike simulations that make real-life surgery safer | Peter Weinstock

Dr. Peter Weinstock, the director of the Pediatric Simulator Program at Boston Children's Hospital, advocates for the use of lifelike surgical simulations to improve patient outcomes. His team creates detailed simulations using data from CT scans and MRIs, utilizing 3D printing and Hollywood special effects to enhance realism. By rehearsing surgeries before the actual procedure, surgical teams can reduce mistakes and become more confident and comfortable. Weinstock's team also emphasizes the importance of post-simulation debriefing using Lean and Six Sigma technologies to optimize performance. This technology-based approach has revolutionized how doctors can practice and prepare for complex surgeries.

In this section of the video, Dr. Peter Weinstock presents a case of a newborn girl born with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, a rare condition in which the intestines sneak up into the chest, making it difficult for the baby to breathe. He explains that the current model of training in the healthcare system is an apprenticeship model, and the implicit assumption is practicing on patients. He proposes a better approach that would be using medical simulation, which has proven to be successful in other high-stakes industries such as nuclear power and the airline industry. Simulations can help make the rare common and ultimately make surgery safer for patients.

In this section, Peter Weinstock talks about the importance of training for scenarios that may not occur often in real life, but are critical to be prepared for. He draws parallels to the airline and sports industries where simulators and progressive training are used to prepare for rare events. Weinstock then discusses a case of a child with hydrocephalus and the traditional surgery involved, along with minimally invasive approaches. He highlights the challenge in training for this procedure and how surgeons often use a red pepper as a training model. Weinstock emphasizes the need for better training methods and how his team at Boston Children's Hospital is manufacturing reproductions of children to practice surgical procedures on, similar to how baseball players use batting cages to practice their swings.

In this section, Peter Weinstock, the director of the Pediatric Simulator Program at Boston Children's Hospital, explains how his team has created lifelike surgical simulations that enable surgical teams to rehearse operations before the actual surgeries, thereby making the procedures safer for patients. Weinstock's team uses data from CT scans and MRIs to create digital anatomy, surface-scan different elements of the patient, and recreate them through three-dimensional printing, allowing for simulators that are incredibly detailed. They have even teamed up with Hollywood special effects firm Fractured FX to enhance the realism of the simulations. The simulations enable surgical teams to practice until they feel confident and comfortable, reduce mistakes, and improve patient outcomes. The team's approach includes a debriefing step that uses Lean and Six Sigma technologies to optimize the team's performance.

In this section, Peter Weinstock explains how the team at Boston Children's Hospital uses lifelike simulations to prepare for surgeries. The team assembles before the baby is born, and they use the reproduced anatomy that they gained from scans and images to do the procedure on a simulated bedside multiple times. By doing so, they can tackle any problems that they might face during the surgery. This new technology in healthcare has revolutionized how doctors can approach surgeries and has allowed them to take on complex surgeries with confidence.
