Epidemiology is the science of how we know in the real world if something is good for us or bad for us. Ben Goldacre discusses some of the examples of bad science that he has come across, such as headlines that claim coffee both causes and prevents cancer, divorce both causes and prevents cancer, and that eating spinach will make you wrinkly. He goes on to explain that proper science requires proper evidence, and that observational studies such as the one cited in the article are not good enough. He finishes by discussing the importance of real world studies in epidemiology, and how observational studies can be misleading if the population studied is not representative of the population as a whole.

Ben Goldacre discusses the problem of data disappearing in clinical trials, and how statistics and stories can be used to investigate this problem. He discusses the case of reboxetine, a drug he himself has prescribed, and how data on this drug was withheld from doctors and patients. He also discusses the problem of incomplete trial data, and how this is preventing scientists from making informed decisions about treatments. Goldacre concludes that sunlight is the best disinfectant, as all of these problems are being protected by a force field of tediousness.
