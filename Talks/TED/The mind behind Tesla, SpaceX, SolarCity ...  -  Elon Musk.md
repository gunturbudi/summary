# Summary of The mind behind Tesla, SpaceX, SolarCity ... | Elon Musk

Elon Musk believes sustainable transport and energy production are crucial for the future of humanity and the biggest problem we must solve this century. He explains that charging an electric car with power from a stationary power plant is at least twice as efficient as burning it in an internal combustion engine car. Tesla aims to create mass-market electric cars and has developed the Supercharging technology for convenient charging times. Musk also discusses SolarCity, the company he founded to enable properties to generate their own power, and predicts that solar power will be a plurality of power within 20 years. SpaceX, his space exploration project, aims to evolve humanity into a space-faring civilization and explore other planets. The company has been working on reusable rockets to make spaceflight more affordable, and Musk credits his ability to think at a system level and use first principles reasoning to synthesize design, technology, and business for the company's success.

In this section, Elon Musk explains his motivation for taking on the auto industry and building an all-electric car. He believes that sustainable transport and energy production are crucial for the future of humanity, and the biggest problem that we have to solve this century, even beyond environmental concerns. Using natural gas as an example, he explains that charging an electric car with power produced at a stationary power plant is at least twice as efficient as burning it at the power plant in an internal combustion engine car. The Tesla Model S is an example of an incredibly energy-efficient car due to its all-aluminum body and chassis, low drag coefficient, and advanced battery pack. Despite being an expensive car, Tesla ultimately aims to create a mass-market electric car.

In this section, Elon Musk talks about Tesla's three-step process for their cars and their progress in creating a compelling mass-market product. He also talks about Tesla's charging infrastructure and how they've developed the Supercharging technology to allow people to drive long distances with convenient charging times. Musk also talks about his company SolarCity and how he's confident that solar power will beat everything, including natural gas. He goes on to talk about their current proposition to consumers, which is zero upfront cost when installing the panels and the notion of buying or leasing solar systems.

In this section, Elon Musk talks about SolarCity, his company that aims to raise capital to purchase and install solar panels on residential and commercial properties, enabling them to generate their own power and become self-sufficient from traditional utility companies. Musk predicts that solar power will be a plurality of power within 20 years. He also discusses the goal of SpaceX, his space exploration project, which aims to advance rocket technology and make it more affordable and reusable so that humanity can evolve into a space-faring civilization and explore other planets. Musk explains how SpaceX has made significant advances in rocket technology but has not patented the innovations due to the questionable enforceability of patents against national governments. He discusses the plan to create a rapidly and fully reusable rocket.

In this section, Elon Musk discusses the importance of reusable rockets for space travel and achieving his dream of making life multi-planetary. He explains that the cost of fuel is a small fraction of the cost of a rocket, so achieving effective rocket reuse could bring about a 100-fold improvement in the cost of spaceflight. Musk's company SpaceX has been working on a Grasshopper Test Project to test the vertical landing of rockets, which has been making good progress. When asked how he has achieved such innovation, Musk credits his ability to think at a system level and use first principles reasoning to synthesize design, technology, and business.

In this section, Elon Musk talks about the importance of applying the physics approach when doing something new. He sees physics as a way of figuring out how to discover new counterintuitive things that can be incredibly helpful. Musk also stresses the importance of paying attention to negative feedback and soliciting it from friends, which he believes is incredibly helpful. Finally, he advises boys and girls to study physics and learn from the discipline as it can be helpful in one's life.
