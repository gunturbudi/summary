# Summary of The next manufacturing revolution is here | Olivier Scalabre

In a YouTube video titled "The next manufacturing revolution is here", speaker Olivier Scalabre discusses the decline in growth of the global economy over the past 50 years and the need for a new manufacturing revolution to improve productivity and change the current manufacturing model. He introduces the fourth industrial revolution, which incorporates advanced manufacturing robots and 3D printing through additive manufacturing to boost industrial productivity by over a third and create macroeconomic shifts that will benefit all. The new manufacturing model involves producing goods next to the consumer market, resulting in a cleaner and more environmentally friendly process and creating more growth and productivity. The revolution will also benefit developing economies and lead to a domestic consumption-driven model.

In this section, the speaker discusses the issue of declining growth in the global economy over the past 50 years and how this impacts future generations. He attributes the growth of economies to manufacturing revolutions in history such as the steam engine, mass-production model and automation wave. The speaker proposes a new revolution that will change the way globalization is shaped by improving productivity and changing the current manufacturing model that has remained unchanged for the past 50 years. He highlights current attempts to fix the manufacturing model as short-sighted and suggests that technology innovations haven't really helped productivity.

In this section, the speaker introduces the fourth industrial revolution, where major technologies that boost industrial productivity by more than a third are entering the manufacturing space. Advanced manufacturing robots play a significant role in this revolution and can perform complex, non-repetitive tasks alongside human workers, leading to a 20% increase in productivity, manufacturing output, and growth in the next ten years. 3D printing through additive manufacturing is also part of this revolution, improving production output and product customization capabilities. The new manufacturing revolution will lead to macroeconomic shifts, including relocating factories to home markets, driving regional trade flows instead of East-to-West trade, and ultimately creating growth opportunities.

In this section, the speaker discusses the benefits of a new manufacturing model that involves producing goods next to the consumer market, creating a cleaner and more environmentally friendly process. This will lead to more growth and productivity, but mature economies will have to retrain their workforce and teach manufacturing again at the university level. The manufacturing revolution will also benefit developing economies and lead to a domestic consumption-driven model, creating more growth than ever before. If done correctly, this revolution will result in more wealth being distributed to all of us and a better future for our children.
