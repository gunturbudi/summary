# Summary of The age of genetic wonder | Juan Enriquez

Juan Enriquez recounts the incredible evolution of technology from telescopes which were once considered miraculous to the current developments in gene editing. Genetics research has led to an understanding of life as a simple code, opening up the potential for scientists to edit genetic code, from terminal diseases to personality traits, at a relatively low cost. However, as the power of genetic editing grows, ethical and policy concerns will arise. Enriquez discusses the potential of synthetic biology in the development of carbon-neutral fuels and the ability to redesign species and humans. Ultimately, the merging of digital age, genome biology, CRISPR, synthetic biology, and the age of the brain will lead to an age of miracles and wonders.

In this section, Juan Enriquez discusses the impact and evolution of technology from telescopes to the current developments in gene editing. While telescopes were once considered a miracle that could help us discover if life existed beyond our planet, recent genetically-based breakthroughs have given scientists the power to read, write, and edit life. These developments are being made possible due to the realization that life is simple code, much like a computer program. By editing genetic code, editing anything from a terminal disease to a personality trait is now possible, opening up a whole new world of opportunities. However, as the cost of genetic editing continues to drop, he emphasizes that issues around ethics and policy centering around the technology will also arise in the near future.

In this section, the speaker discusses the advancements being made in genetics research and the ability to zoom in on and identify specific genes. He highlights the amount of information being gathered and created in one of the largest databases in the world and the use of this information to create maps of various plagues and diseases. The new proactive biology allows scientists to make things rather than just observe them, as seen in the creation of the world's first synthetic life form. This ability to program cells will lead to a new industrial revolution and allow the creation of almost anything at a rapid pace.

In this section, Juan Enriquez discusses the potential of synthetic biology, including the ability to produce close to carbon-neutral fuels and substitute agricultural lands with vats at a higher productivity rate. He also touches on the rise of theoretical biology through the use of large amounts of data to make predictions. On a consumer level, companies like 23andMe give access to genomic sequencing and will have access to large databases. Enriquez also discusses the long-term trends of redesigning species and designing humans, including the ability to eliminate genes for diseases like cystic fibrosis and the ethical debates that come with it. Furthermore, the ability to use gene drives in mosquitoes to stop the spread of malaria raises questions about possible effects on the environment.

In this section, Juan Enriquez discusses two long-term trends in technology: artificial life and the merging of the digital age, genome biology, CRISPR, synthetic biology and the age of the brain. These trends will eventually lead to humans being able to regrow most of their body parts, and the quest to answer questions like "how common is life in the universe?" and "where did we come from?" will open up new frontiers in science. Enriquez concludes that we are living in an age of miracles and wonders.
