# Summary of Chimps have feelings and thoughts. They should also have rights

Animal rights lawyer Steven Wise discusses the concept of legal personhood, the historical legal separation between humans (as legal persons) and non-human animals (as legal things), and the idea that non-human animals, specifically chimpanzees, possess the cognitive capabilities that should grant them rights as non-human persons. Wise and his team at the Nonhuman Rights Project have used the writ of habeas corpus to argue for the autonomy and self-determination of non-human beings, filing lawsuits on behalf of chimpanzees to demand their release from captivity and recognition as legal persons. Wise argues that taking into account chimpanzee cognition studies conducted by experts worldwide shows that they possess consciousness, mental time travel, moral capacity, intentional and referential communication, and even culture.

In this section, Steven Wise, an animal rights lawyer, discusses the legal separation between legal things and legal persons. He explains how non-human animals have always been legally considered as things or slaves, while only human beings are legal persons. However, legal things like corporations and holy books have also been recognized as legal persons. Wise has been advocating for animal rights and the idea of legal personhood for non-human animals for over 30 years, and he explains how litigating such cases involves establishing a legal cause of action.

In this section, an interesting legal case from 1772 is discussed, where a black slave named James Somerset was able to move from being a legal thing to becoming a legal person, thanks to a writ of habeas corpus being issued on his behalf by the powerful judge, Lord Mansfield. The values of liberty and equality were chosen as guiding principles by the Nonhuman Rights Project to argue for the autonomy and self-determination of nonhuman beings, who like humans should have rights and be considered legal persons. The Nonhuman Rights Project searched through 80 jurisdictions for seven years before deciding to file their first suit in the state of New York on behalf of their plaintiffs.

In this section, legal scholar and animal rights activist Steven Wise talks about the cognitive capabilities of chimpanzees and how their autonomous and self-determined behaviors should grant them rights as non-human persons. He discussed the various ways in which chimpanzees possess the same cognitive traits as humans, such as consciousness, mental time travel, moral capacity, numeracy, intentional and referential communication, and even culture - a material, social, and symbolic one. By taking into account chimpanzee cognition studies conducted by experts across the world, Wise and his team at the Nonhuman Rights Project filed three suits using the common law writ of habeas corpus to demand that adult chimpanzees be released from captivity and be brought to a sanctuary to live as chimpanzees should.
