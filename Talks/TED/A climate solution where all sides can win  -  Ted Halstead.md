This Ted Halstead video discusses a climate solution that would involve allocating money directly to citizens in the form of equal monthly dividends, solving the psychological barrier of giving everyone a tangible benefit, and creating a positive feedback loop that would result in even more emissions reductions. The solution would be more effective than current climate regulations and would be able to be implemented rapidly due to the border carbon adjustments component. China would be the first country to adopt this solution, and other countries would soon follow suit.

Ted Halstead discusses the logic behind his climate solution, which would enable all sides to win. He argues that the Trump administration's repeal-only strategy is only the first move in a complex game of climate chess, and that the pressure will mount for a replacement program. He cites three reasons why this is likely to happen: the business community is against climate change, there is a fundamental gap between Republican leadership and the Republican base on this issue, and the international pressure will be overwhelming if the Trump administration doesn't stay in Paris Agreement.
