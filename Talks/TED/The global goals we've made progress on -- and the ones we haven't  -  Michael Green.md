# Summary of The global goals we've made progress on -- and the ones we haven't | Michael Green

In this video, Michael Green discusses the progress made and not made on the global goals, focusing on water and sanitation. He predicts that by 2030, the world will only achieve a score of 86 on this goal. He suggests that the solution to this problem is to scale water and sanitation solutions to all countries.

The Social Progress Index is a measure of the quality of life of countries, ranging from the basic needs of survival (food, water, shelter, safety) to the foundations of well-being (education, information, health and the environment) and opportunity (rights, freedom of choice, inclusiveness and access to higher education). Denmark is predicted to achieve the SDGs by 2030, but the US is projected to fall far behind.

The global goals have made progress on some issues, but have not made as much progress on others. The biggest opportunity for progress is on SDG 6, which is aimed at reducing inequality. However, countries are not making much progress on this goal. Inclusiveness is also a challenge, with many countries falling backwards on this issue.
