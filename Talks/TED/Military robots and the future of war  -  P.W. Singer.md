# Summary of Military robots and the future of war | P.W. Singer

In this YouTube video titled "Military robots and the future of war," P.W. Singer discusses the role of military robots in modern warfare and how they are revolutionizing the way wars are fought. Singer stresses that the use of robots in war will have a major impact on the future, and it will fundamentally change the "who" of fighting as well as the "how." He also mentions the rise of cubicle warriors and the ethical concerns surrounding autonomous military machines. Singer challenges the audience to face the reality of modern warfare and not make the same mistakes as previous generations by not addressing the ethical concerns surrounding autonomous weapons until it is too late.

In this section, the speaker describes the role of military robots in the Iraq War and how they are already revolutionizing the way wars are fought. The use of robots like the PackBot has saved many lives, but it also represents a new era in which robots will play a critical role on the battlefield. With thousands of robots already in use, and tens of thousands more expected in the future, the speaker warns that this robots revolution may be even bigger than the atomic bomb because it will fundamentally change the "who" of fighting as well as the "how".

In this section, P.W. Singer discusses how the future of war, even in robotics, is not going to be a purely American one. While the US is currently ahead in military robotics, there are 43 other countries working on military robotics, including Russia, China, Pakistan, and Iran. As warfare becomes more open-source, there is a worry about going to war with soldiers whose hardware is made in China and software is written in India. Additionally, good guys might play around and work on hobby kits, but so might bad guys. This cross between robotics and terrorism may be fascinating and even disturbing, and we are likely to see an expansion in the realm of terrorism as these two trends take place.

In this section, the speaker discusses the impact of the ability to turn video clips of war, particularly those featuring robots or machines, into entertainment, resulting in war porn. He highlights the irony that while the future of war may involve more machines, it's human psychology and failings that are driving it. This is seen in the continued war of ideas against radical groups, as seen with the different messaging that is missed with the use of machines in conflict. The section also discusses the rise of a new type of warrior - the cubicle warrior - that is redefining the experience of going to war. The psychological balancing of their experiences is incredibly tough, and this disconnection may lead to easier contemplation of war crimes. Finally, the section highlights the new human dilemmas that come with gaining incredible new capabilities in war, including the "oops" moments that can be both funny and tragic, as well as the new wrinkles in the laws of war and accountability that arise from unmanned slaughter.

In this section, the speaker discusses the ethical concerns surrounding unmanned slaughter and autonomous military machines. The possibility of autonomous military robots with the authority to use force raises questions about war crimes, since robots lack emotions and cannot differentiate between a person and a tank. Outdated laws of war may need to be updated to catch up to 21st century technology and its implications for war. The speaker challenges the audience to face the reality of modern warfare and not make the same mistakes as previous generations with atomic weaponry by not addressing the ethical concerns surrounding autonomous weapons until it is too late. The potential for duality in machines and humans to be used for both good and evil is also discussed, questioning if it is the machines themselves or the inherent drive within human nature that is wired for war.
