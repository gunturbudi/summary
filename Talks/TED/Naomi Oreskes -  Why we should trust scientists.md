# Summary of Naomi Oreskes: Why we should trust scientists

In this video, Naomi Oreskes discusses the importance of trusting scientists in matters such as climate change and vaccine safety. She explains that science is not a matter of belief but rather a method that scientists follow, which involves developing hypotheses, deducing the consequences of those hypotheses, and testing them in the natural world to know if they're true. However, she notes some flaws in the traditional textbook model of science, including the fallacy of affirming the consequent and the problem of auxiliary hypotheses. Oreskes also emphasizes how scientists use physical models and computer simulations to understand the causes of natural phenomena, and how science is an appeal to the authority of a collective community of researchers who work on a specific problem. She encourages the public to become better listeners, trusting scientific inquiry based on evidence, and not blindly accepting what they are told.

In this section, the speaker discusses why many people don't believe in science even though scientists tell us that things like climate change is real and vaccines are safe. She explains that scientists themselves don't consider science to be a matter of belief like religion is, but rather rely on a method that they follow. The textbook model, or hypothetical deductive method, involves scientists developing hypotheses, deducing the consequences of those hypotheses, and testing them in the natural world to know if they're true. This model is important because it concerns a law of nature, which can't be broken and will always be true in all times and places. Therefore, we should trust scientists not because they're always right, but because they follow this method to come to their conclusions.

In this section, Naomi Oreskes talks about the flaws in the traditional textbook model of science. The first reason she gives is the fallacy of affirming the consequent, where false theories can make true predictions. The second reason is the problem of auxiliary hypotheses, where assumptions are made by scientists that may or may not even be aware of. Lastly, Oreskes mentions that a lot of science does not fit into the textbook model as much of it is inductive, meaning that scientists do not necessarily start with a theory or hypothesis, they just collect data to look for patterns in the natural world.

In this section of the video, Naomi Oreskes discusses how scientists use physical models and computer simulations to understand the causes of natural phenomena. She uses the example of climate change, demonstrating how a computer model helps scientists determine the causes of the observed temperature increase in the Earth. Oreskes emphasizes how scientists scrutinize data and evidence collectively through organized skepticism, which means that they are skeptical of new claims and that the burden of proof lies with the person making the claim. Ultimately, science is the consensus of scientific experts.

In this section, Naomi Oreskes explains that scientific knowledge is a consensus of experts, similar to a jury of geeks who come to a conclusion either confirming or denying the evidence through organized and collective scrutiny. She notes that science is an appeal to authority, but not the authority of an individual, but the authority of the collective community of researchers who work on a specific problem. The scientist has to become a better communicator in explaining to the public how they know something, and the public must become better listeners, trusting scientific inquiry based on evidence, and not blindly accepting what they are told.
