# Summary of How Airbnb designs for trust | Joe Gebbia

Joe Gebbia, co-founder of Airbnb, shares how the company was able to build trust between strangers through design, which was crucial to the company's success. Initially, investors were wary of the concept due to the fear of strangers, but the company addressed this by creating a reputation system and waiting until both guests and hosts had left a review before revealing them. The key was to design for trust by finding the right amount of disclosure to encourage sharing. Gebbia believes that design can overcome our inherent "stranger-danger" bias and wonders what else can be designed for next.

Eventually, the team learned to wait until both guests and hosts left a review before revealing them. They also discovered that building the right amount of trust takes the right amount of disclosure, and they use prompts to encourage sharing. Airbnb's whole success was due to the hope that people would be willing to overcome the stranger-danger bias, thanks to the right design.

In this section, Joe Gebbia discusses the importance of trust in the sharing economy, and how it can lead to magical experiences between guests and hosts. Though there have been some negative incidents, such as unauthorized parties and hosts leaving guests stranded, these are rare occurrences. The key is to see the sharing economy as commerce with the promise of human connection, where people share a part of themselves, changing the transaction. The future of this economy goes beyond just renting out homes and could involve shared cities that encourage community and connection. Ultimately, the power of the sharing economy lies in its ability to provide authentic local experiences.

While he acknowledges that design cannot solve all of the world's problems, he wonders what else can be designed for next if it can help make a dent in something as fundamental as trust.
