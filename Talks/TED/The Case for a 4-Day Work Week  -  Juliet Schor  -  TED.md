# Summary of The Case for a 4-Day Work Week | Juliet Schor | TED

Juliet Schor makes a case for a four-day workweek in this TED talk. She explains that many companies have seen benefits such as happier and more productive employees, lower turnover rates, and higher-quality applicants with shorter hours. The policy has shown benefits for workers, businesses, and society, and can even be a gateway for addressing climate change. Schor argues that implementing a four-day workweek can address several challenges in our current moment, including burnout and depression, inequalities of race and income, and the climate crisis. She suggests that starting company by company will eventually lead to a universal transition from scarcity thinking to appreciating the true wealth of our ingenuity, compassion, and humanity.

In this section, the speaker discusses the "four-day week", a policy that's been around for nearly a decade but has recently been growing in popularity, especially due to the pandemic. Some companies have started experimenting with shorter hours and have seen benefits such as happier and more productive employees, lower turnover rates, and higher-quality applicants. The speaker explains that in most cases, individuals are as productive in four days as they are in five, and many companies have cut back the least productive activities, such as meetings, to make the workday more efficient. Government initiatives have also seen positive results, with physical and mental stress decreasing and productivity and service quality remaining the same or improving. The four-day week has shown benefits for workers, businesses, and society, and can even be a gateway for addressing climate change.

In this section, the speaker discusses various countries that have implemented reduced work weeks and seen productivity improvements. Long-hour countries like the UK and Italy have lower productivity compared to Norway and Denmark with shorter work hours. Even the US could do better in productivity if work time is reduced. While some industries are suited for reduced hours, it is not feasible everywhere. Nonetheless, with digitization and AI, the opportunity to reduce work time has arrived. This path could also address the climate crisis, as people tend to have a lower carbon footprint when given more time rather than money. The four-day week is a down payment on a new way of living and working, and everyone deserves a right to free time, which can be made possible with government support and the adoption of a universal basic income.

In this section, Schor argues that implementing a four-day workweek can address several challenges in our current moment, including burnout and depression, inequalities of race and income, and the climate crisis. She suggests that starting company by company will eventually lead to a universal transition from scarcity thinking to appreciating the true wealth of our ingenuity, compassion, and humanity. In response to a practical question, Schor explains that every company can adopt the four-day workweek differently depending on their needs and schedules.
