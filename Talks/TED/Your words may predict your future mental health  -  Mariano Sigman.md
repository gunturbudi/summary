# Summary of Your words may predict your future mental health | Mariano Sigman

This video discusses an algorithm that can be used to predict a person's mental health based on their words. The algorithm was used to predict the mental health of 34 people who were at high risk of developing schizophrenia, and despite the hopes of the researchers, the algorithm was not successful in predicting the future development of psychosis.

The video discusses the idea that the deepest aspects of human thought--such as our ability to imagine, be conscious, and dream--have always been the same, or that the social transformations that have shaped our culture may have also changed the structural columns of human thought.

The hypothesis is that consciousness, at least in the way we perceive it today, where we feel that we are the pilots of our own existence, is a quite recent cultural development.

The problem with the hypothesis is that it is based on just a few and very specific examples.

One way to investigate the hypothesis is to follow the simple assumption that when two words are related, they tend to appear in the same sentences, paragraphs, and documents more often than would be expected just by pure chance.

This simple method, using computational tricks that have to do with the fact that this is a very complex and high-dimensional space, is quite effective at finding the emergence of a concept that's never said.

For instance, words automatically organize into semantic neighborhoods, break down into subcategories, and hierarchize concepts.

The video discusses how semantic coherence--the extent to which words stay within one semantic category--can predict who will develop psychosis. It shows how reading between the lines can help predict a person's mental health.
