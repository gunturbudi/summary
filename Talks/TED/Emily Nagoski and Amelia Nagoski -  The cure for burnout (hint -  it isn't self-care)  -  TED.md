# Summary of Emily Nagoski and Amelia Nagoski: The cure for burnout (hint: it isn't self-care) | TED

Burnout is a condition where a person's body and mind are worn down from stress. It can be caused by any situation that requires ongoing investment and requires that a person separates themselves emotionally from their work. The three components of burnout are depersonalization, decreased sense of accomplishment, and emotional exhaustion. All of these factors can be caused by any number of stressors, but the way the individual experiences them is largely determined by their gender.
