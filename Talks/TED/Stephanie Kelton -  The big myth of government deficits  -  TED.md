# Summary of Stephanie Kelton: The big myth of government deficits | TED

Stephanie Kelton challenges traditional thinking about government spending and deficits in the US, arguing that deficits can actually become financial surpluses when viewed from a different perspective. As the Federal Government is the issuer of currency, it can never run out of money, but deficits need to be used wisely and fairly. Kelton suggests that Congress should prioritize keeping inflation in check instead of worrying about the deficit by focusing on resourcing rather than paying for initiatives. With a better understanding of public money, the government can build a world that cares for its people and the planet.

In this section, Stephanie Kelton highlights the flaws in the traditional way of thinking about government spending and deficits in the United States. While the pandemic offered opportunities for governments to realize how deficits and spending can help support the economy and reduce inequality with direct money sent to citizens and debt relief offered to millions of students, we are now reverting back to old habits and ways of thinking about the limits on government spending. Instead of asking how we will pay for things, Kelton suggests we should ask whether we have the political will and real resources to implement social programs that make society better off. Kelton emphasizes the important reminder that we are no longer on a gold standard and points to the flaws of the contemporary version of Margaret Thatcher's dictum.

In this section, Stephanie Kelton explains that unlike individuals, small businesses and corporations, the federal government can never run out of money as it is the issuer of the currency. When Congress and the president agree to spend more, the Federal Reserve gets that money into the financial system electronically. Deficits, which are usually seen negatively, can actually become financial surpluses when viewed from a different perspective. Kelton sees deficits as a financial contribution to some part of the economy and believes it matters how the money is spent and who benefits from it. Tax cuts for the wealthy without investment and opportunity for the rest of the population do not make good use of deficits.

In this section, Stephanie Kelton argues that Congress should prioritize keeping inflation in check instead of worrying about the deficit. She says that rather than asking how the government will pay for something, Congress should be asking how it will resource it, by considering the people, factories, and materials needed for a particular plan. Kelton mentions that in a full-employment economy, all resources are already fully employed, and the government would need to compete with the private sector, leading to inflation. She emphasizes that with a better understanding of public money and a focus on resourcing rather than paying for initiatives, the government can build a world that cares for its people and the planet.
