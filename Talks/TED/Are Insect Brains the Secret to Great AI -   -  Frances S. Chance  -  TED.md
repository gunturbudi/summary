# Summary of Are Insect Brains the Secret to Great AI? | Frances S. Chance | TED

Neuroscientists believe that studying insect brains could help them to create artificial intelligence that is more efficient than what is currently possible. Insect brains are able to perform complex tasks with very few neurons, which could lead to better computer models of the brain and new neuro-inspired devices.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Insect brains are fascinating for their small size and ability to perform specific tasks well. By studying these brains, neuroscientists hope to learn how to create artificial intelligence that is as efficient as natural intelligence.

Insect brains are small and efficient, able to calculate coordinates transformations in only one step using a limited number of neurons. This has implications for computer models of the brain, as well as for neuro-inspired devices.
