# Summary of Lessons from the longest study on human development | Helen Pearson

The study found that children who come from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to struggle in all areas of their lives, including their health as adults. The video highlights two lessons from the study: that parents matter, and that even small things that parents do can have a big impact on their children's lives.

In the 70 years since scientists began following thousands of children through their lives, they've found that those who start off disadvantaged in life are more likely to struggle in all areas of their lives. One surprising finding is that those who have a difficult start in life are also more likely to be unhealthy as adults.

The first lesson from this study is that to have a successful life, choose your parents carefully as their environment and behavior during the first few years of life has a profound impact on the rest of their lives. The second lesson is that parents matter, and even small things that parents do (e.g. reading to their children) are associated with better outcomes for their children.

This 1-minute video summarizes the findings of a study that found that good parenting only reduced the educational gap between the rich and poor children by 50%. This research suggests that child poverty leaves a lasting scar that can hinder a child's success. Parents can help their children by listening to them, providing talking time, and reading to them.
