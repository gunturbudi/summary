# Summary of After billions of years of monotony, the universe is waking up | David Deutsch

David Deutsch discusses how the lack of creative progress in human existence before the scientific revolution and Enlightenment led to a static society and suffering. He emphasizes that humans have the ability to create novelty, which can alleviate suffering and transform the planet. The universe has been relatively simple and monotonous, but the biosphere violates the hierarchy rule, and explanatory knowledge can control any physical process. Deutsch argues that humans' ability to create knowledge is critical to the ongoing evolution of the universe, which has gradually become more complex and interesting over billions of years.

In this section, David Deutsch discusses the lack of creative progress in human existence before the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment. He explains how ancient people often explained the constant suffering and monotony of their world in grandiose cosmic terms through falsehoods instead of trying to guess better explanations. Deutsch emphasizes that human life without novelty is life without creativity, without progress, and is a static society that leads to a zero-sum game. Additionally, all sources of suffering hurt people until knowledge can be created to prevent them. Through the scientific revolution and Enlightenment, humans have been able to progress and create novelty for future generations, alleviating suffering and monotony.

In this section, David Deutsch highlights the different perspectives in physics, from the classical view of order and chaos to the current battle between sustainability and wastefulness. These accounts of the human condition are pessimistic and inaccurate in the sense that they do not portray humans as shapers of the universe, as we have the ability to create novelty. Deutsch explains that the first era of novelty in the universe after the big bang gave rise to the first atom, star, black hole, and galaxy. However, after the great monotony began, there were no new astronomical objects until the origin of life. The creation of life on Earth gave birth to genetic knowledge, creating novelty, transforming the surface of the planet, and creating billions of different chemicals, and eventually explanatory knowledge, which is universal and the defining adaptation of our species.

In this section, David Deutsch explains that the universe is relatively simple, leading to great monotony by the hierarchy rule; since large, massive, and powerful things strongly impact smaller things, but not the other way around. However, the hierarchy rule is not a law of nature, and our biosphere violates or reverses it because genes control large-scale resources. Explanatory knowledge is more powerful than the hierarchy rule as it can control any physical process. The progress of knowledge is slow and gradual but has significant impacts on the world, turning Earth into the only known object in the universe that diverts incoming asteroids instead of attracting them.

In this section, David Deutsch talks about how the universe, once a mundane and monotonous place, has gradually become more and more complex over billions of years. He discusses the role of evolution and natural selection in this process, as well as the critical importance of knowledge and learning in driving it forward. Deutsch argues that as agents capable of creating knowledge, humans have a unique role to play in the ongoing evolution of the universe. He suggests that by continuing to learn and create new knowledge, we can help to ensure that the universe continues to become more complex and interesting over time.
