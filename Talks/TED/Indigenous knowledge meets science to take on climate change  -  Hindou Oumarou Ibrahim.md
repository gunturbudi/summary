In this section, the speaker, Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, emphasizes the significant impact of climate change on her community's environment, leading to their social life changes as well. She explains how her community's way of life, as pastoral and nomadic people, is closely connected to nature, and they depend on it for various purposes such as their supermarkets, pharmacies, and schools. However, the shrinking resources due to climate change have resulted in conflict and migration, affecting the social roles of men and women in their community. Climate change has threatened the dignity of men by taking them away from their families in search of resources, leading some of them to migrate to the big city, and some even to Europe.

In this section, Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim discusses how indigenous knowledge can be combined with scientific knowledge to tackle climate change. Indigenous peoples have traditional knowledge that can help increase resilience to climate change, not just for their communities but for others as well. Indigenous peoples are also responsible for saving 80 percent of the world's biodiversity. By combining the knowledge systems of science, technology, and traditional knowledge, we can protect our planet and restore the ecosystem that we are losing. Hindou also talks about how she used 3D participatory mapping, which involves bringing an entire community together to build a map that has all the knowledge they have about where their sacred forest, water points, corridors, and other key locations are.

In this section, Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim discusses 3D participatory mapping, an innovative tool that combines indigenous knowledge and modern technology to help communities adapt to climate change. The map is created by both men and women in indigenous communities, with women's voices and knowledge being crucial in identifying resources needed for adaptation. Through the use of this map, communities can mitigate conflict over resources and manage them for the long term. Ibrahim emphasizes the importance of combining indigenous knowledge with scientific and technological knowledge to build resilience against climate change impacts, calling on decision makers to prioritize this collaboration on a global scale.
