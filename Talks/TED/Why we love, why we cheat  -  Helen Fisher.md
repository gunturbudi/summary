# Summary of Why we love, why we cheat | Helen Fisher

Love expert Dr. Helen Fisher discusses the science behind the three basic drives of the human brain- the sex drive, romantic love, and long-term attachment. Fisher explains how romantic love drives possessiveness, obsession, and intense craving, which evolved from the mating and reproduction process. She delves into the impact of gender differences on the job market, sexuality, romance, and family life. Fisher predicts that women moving into the workforce and the rise of technology are profoundly affecting the three brain systems. Ultimately, Fisher concludes that love is unpredictable, and the unconscious "love map" we develop in childhood, timing, proximity, mystery, and the compatibility of the brain systems may contribute to why we fall in love with certain people over others.

In this section, Fisher discusses her research on romantic love and the specific traits associated with it. According to Fisher, when a person falls in love, they begin to focus all their attention on that person, aggrandize them, experience intense energy and craving, develop an obsession, and become extremely sexually possessive. Fisher believes that the point of romantic love is to pull two people together enough to rear babies as a team, and that this is the reason for the intense craving and possessiveness.

In this section, Fisher explains that romantic love is more than just an emotion, it is actually a drive that comes from a craving part of the mind. She further explains that romantic love, the elation and obsession of early love, is one of three different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction. The other two systems are the sex drive and attachment for a long-term partner. Fisher predicts that the two most profound social trends affecting these three systems are women moving into the workforce and the rise of technology.

In this section, the speaker discusses the impact of gender differences on the job market, sexuality, romance, and family life. Women are a powerful force in the business community, bringing with them incredible people and negotiating skills, as well as a tendency to be web thinkers. As women move into the job market, they are starting to express their sexuality more openly, earlier on, with more partners, and without any remorse. Symmetrical marriage between equals is becoming more common, which is compatible with the ancient human spirit. Moreover, there is a rise in romantic love, and people are unlikely to marry someone who ticks off all their boxes for a partner.

In this section, Fisher explains that arranged marriages are becoming rare around the world, and people in 37 societies wish to be in love with the person they marry. Fisher believes that marriages may become more stable because of the aging world population, with the highest age category of people aged 76 to 85 showing 40% of people have nothing wrong with them. Fisher suggests marriages can be even better now because women have never been as educated, interesting, or capable as they are now. However, Fisher also notes that the three brain systems of lust, romantic love, and attachment can exist independently from one another or together, and we are capable of loving more than one person at a time. Additionally, Fisher expresses a worry about antidepressants that raise the level of serotonin which in turn can suppress the dopamine circuit associated with romantic love and kill the sex drive, the orgasm, and attachment-linked flood of drugs.

In this section, love expert Dr. Helen Fisher discusses why we fall in love with certain people over others. She cites factors such as timing, proximity, mystery, and the unconscious list of traits called the "love map" that we develop in childhood. Additionally, Fisher believes that people also tend to gravitate towards those with complementary brain systems. She then shares a story of a guy who attempted to make a girl fall in love with him through a novel and exciting activity, but she ended up crushing on the rickshaw driver instead, highlighting the magic (and unpredictability) of love. Fisher concludes by emphasizing that the three basic drives of the human brain—the sex drive, romantic love, and long-term attachment—are deeply ingrained within us and will continue to play a fundamental role in our lives for as long as we exist as a species.
