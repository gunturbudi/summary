# Summary of Geraldine Hamilton: Body parts on a chip

Geraldine Hamilton introduces organ-on-a-chip, a technology that recreates a tiny, functional unit that is capable of mimicking human body conditions, allowing for testing on human cells in a more accurate and efficient way. Hamilton's team has developed various organs on a chip, including a gut on a chip and a live human lung on a chip that displays white blood cells fighting bacteria, providing groundbreaking opportunities for research in drug development, toxicity testing, and safety testing of various products without animal testing. Additionally, Hamilton proposes personalized medicine that can identify individual differences that could lead to unpredictable drug reactions using an instrument that links ten or more organ chips together. Hamilton believes that organs on chips provide an innovative and revolutionary solution for improving the way many industries operate and conduct research.

In this section, Geraldine Hamilton explains that the current methods for discovering and developing new drugs are too costly, lengthy, and are not working for patients who badly need therapies. Of the two main tools used for testing whether a drug is safe and effective, cells in dishes and animal testing, both are failing. Hamilton introduces organ-on-a-chip, which recreates a tiny, functional unit that represents the biochemistry, function, and mechanical strain cells experience in the human body. The chip is made with a porous, flexible membrane and uses techniques from the computer chip manufacturing industry. This technology mimics the conditions in the human body, allowing for testing on human cells in a more accurate, efficient way.

In this section, Geraldine Hamilton discusses the various organs on a chip that her team has developed and demonstrates how they function using a live human lung on a chip. The lungs on a chip display white blood cells entering the lung to fight off bacteria, illustrating one of the most fundamental immune responses of the body. The gut on a chip is under constant peristaltic motion, allowing an opportunity to study diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome. Fluidic interconnectivity of the organ chips allows for the formation of a virtual human on a chip, opening groundbreaking opportunities for research in drug development, toxicity testing, clinical trial innovation, and safety testing of various products without animal testing. Organs on chips provide an innovative and revolutionary solution for improving the way many industries operate and conduct research.

In this section, Geraldine Hamilton discusses how the traditional clinical trial process tends to exclude at-risk populations, such as children, without providing adequate safety data on how they are affected by medication. She proposes a solution in the form of cells from different populations put together on chips. Hamilton's team has engineered an instrument that allows 10 or more organ chips to be linked together with an easy user interface. The future implications include personalized medicine that can identify individual differences that could lead to unpredictable drug reactions.
