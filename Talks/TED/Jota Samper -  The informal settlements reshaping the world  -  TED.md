# Summary of Jota Samper: The informal settlements reshaping the world | TED

Jota Samper explains in his TED talk that informal settlements, with over a billion people living in such conditions worldwide, represent one of humanity's biggest challenges. However, a lack of data impedes understanding and support. Samper and his team created the Atlas of Informality, a protocol using open-access software, remote sensing tools, and direct mapping to visualize the invisible populations of slums all over the world. They found that every year, 2,300 square kilometers of informal settlements are created, highlighting the importance of understanding and improving the conditions of living in these areas. Samper believes that by making these invisible populations visible, we can learn from their innovation and creativity for sustainable urban development.

In this section, Jota Samper discusses his experience growing up in a neighborhood of extreme poverty in Medell√≠n, Colombia, and how it led him to study informal settlements. He explains that informal settlements are a widespread form of city-making, with more than a billion people living in such conditions around the world, and that they represent one of humanity's biggest challenges. By making these populations and their living conditions visible, we can save lives, and by paying attention to the creativity of those who live in informal settlements, we could discover innovations that can save the planet. However, there is a scarcity of data available about informal settlements, creating a vacuum that impedes understanding and support.

In this section, Jota Samper discusses the Atlas of Informality, which is an attempt to visualize the invisible populations of informal settlements in an effort to understand the unique process of informal city-making. By creating a protocol with open-access software, remote sensing tools, and direct mapping, Samper and his team have been able to identify and map the change of informal settlements over the last 15 years all over the world. They have discovered that every year, 2,300 square kilometers of informal settlements are created out of the expansion of existing ones, meaning the informal settlement created is larger than some of the largest cities on the planet, highlighting the importance of understanding and improving the conditions of living in these areas. Samper also talks about the need for new cutting-edge strategies, such as those already present within the communities themselves, to solve the most challenging problems of informal settlements.

In this section, Jota Samper highlights the innovation and creativity found in informal settlements as solutions for sustainable urban development. These communities have always found unconventional ways to solve problems that are less environmentally impactful and rely less on big infrastructure improvements. The creation of pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods or community-based banking systems are some examples of the solutions found in these neighborhoods that could work both for informal settlements with less resources and cities in search of sustainable development. Samper argues that by making these invisible populations visible, there is much that we could learn from them for the future of the planet and for our cities that need to be safe.
