In this section, Tim Leberecht provides four subjective principles for building a beautiful organization in an age of machines where machines are replacing the human workforce. First, do the unnecessary, actions that are not necessary, and create something out of nothing. Second, create intimacy in the workplace, which depends a lot on the relationships we have with our coworkers, and the small moments of attachment between these relationships. Organizations should encourage staff to openly discuss their personal relationships to strengthen the bond among themselves, creating lasting intimacy.

In this section, Tim Leberecht discusses the importance of creating intimacy within an organization to foster creativity and productivity. He uses the example of a company, Danone, that asked employees to wear costumes during a three-day strategy retreat. The use of wigs and costumes eradicated hierarchy, allowing for more authenticity and intimacy. Leberecht suggests that authenticity is key and that organizations should be willing to embrace the ugly truth to transform business units, for example, by creating an “ugly room” where problems are identified and celebrated. Demonstrating inclusivity and keeping the organization incomplete is also essential to encourage a sense of community and avoid treating employees as cogs in a machine.
