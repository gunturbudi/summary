# Summary of Teach girls bravery, not perfection | Reshma Saujani

Reshma Saujani, founder of Girls Who Code, explains the bravery deficit that affects girls and women, which she defines as prioritizing perfection over taking risks. This results in fewer women in fields like STEM, boardrooms, C-suites, and Congress. Saujani calls for the need to teach girls to embrace imperfection and bravery from a young age, and to build a supportive sisterhood to undo the socialization of perfection. Saujani believes that when girls are taught to be imperfect and embrace their courage, they can build a better world and contribute to diverse engineering teams that will build the companies of tomorrow.

In this section, Reshma Saujani talks about the bravery deficit and how it impacts women in various fields. According to her, girls are taught to prioritize being perfect and avoiding failures, while boys are taught to take risks and be brave. This results in a lack of women in fields like STEM, boardrooms, C-suites, and Congress. Reshma cites examples like psychologist Carol Dweck's study that found bright girls were more likely to give up when faced with a challenge, while bright boys saw the challenge as energizing. She also references an HP report that shows women only apply for jobs if they meet 100% of the qualifications, while men apply even if they meet 60%. Reshma argues that in order to close the bravery deficit, girls need to be encouraged to take risks and embrace failure instead of fearing it.

In this section, Reshma Saujani discusses the negative effects of girls being socialized to be perfect, causing them to take fewer risks in their careers and be left behind in industries such as computing and tech. She shares how teaching girls to code has instead socialized them to be brave, as coding requires perseverance and trial and error. However, it is not enough to just teach girls to code - we must also undo the socialization of perfection and build a supportive sisterhood, as seen in the success of Girls Who Code graduates who have learned to embrace imperfection and persevere towards their goals. The dreams of girls and women are crucial for innovation and growth in our society, and it is imperative that we teach them to be comfortable with imperfection and bravery from a young age.

In this section, Reshma Saujani emphasizes the importance of teaching young girls to embrace imperfection and bravery instead of striving for perfection. She believes that when girls are taught to be imperfect and embrace their courage, they will build a movement of young women who can build a better world. Her program, Girls Who Code, has taught over 40,000 girls in all 50 states, and she has partnered with companies like Twitter, Facebook, and Microsoft to embed Girls Who Code classrooms. Saujani believes that building diverse engineering teams with women leads to building better things, and it will help women build the companies of tomorrow.
