# Summary of The wonderful and terrifying implications of computers that can learn | Jeremy Howard

Jeremy Howard discusses the rise of machine learning and its commercial success, with deep learning allowing computers to see, read, understand, and even write. Deep learning can recognize concepts, such as humans and cats, by watching videos, and has been used by companies like Google and Baidu to better search databases of images and maps, even to the extent of understanding language at a comparable level to humans. Howard also discusses the potential of machine learning combined with medical expertise, allowing for medical breakthroughs and the creation of diagnostic tests. However, he also highlights the implications of deep learning, such as the potential loss of employment in services as automation becomes more prevalent.

In this section, the speaker talks about the rise of machine learning and its commercial success stories, starting off with the man who invented machine learning, Arthur Samuel. He also discusses how the use of machine learning by companies like Google, Amazon, and LinkedIn have impacted our lives, allowing computers to learn from data rather than being programmed by hand. Furthermore, he speaks about the success of IBM Watson, self-driving cars, and an algorithm called deep learning, which can inspire computers to listen and understand. The speaker also talks about the results of a project run at Kaggle, where an algorithm inspired by the human brain called deep learning was used to win a competition for automatic drug discovery set by Merck and the international academic community in just two weeks.

In this section, Jeremy Howard explains how deep learning has enabled computers to see, read, understand, and even write. He highlights that deep learning can recognize traffic signs better than humans, and by watching videos, deep learning algorithms learn how to identify concepts such as humans and cats, similar to how humans learn. Companies such as Google and Baidu have employed deep learning to better search databases of images and maps. Deep learning's capabilities extend to understanding language at a level comparable to humans, including reading and writing, as shown by algorithms producing nuanced and descriptive sentences about images they have never seen before.

In this section, Jeremy Howard discusses the exciting opportunities that arise with the combination of machine learning and medical expertise. He gives examples of medical breakthroughs such as a Boston team discovering new clinically relevant features of tumors and a Stanford group developing a machine learning-based system that is better than human pathologists at predicting cancer sufferers' survival rates. Howard also talks about the possibility of using data analytic techniques to create diagnostic tests and leave doctors to do what they're best at. He demonstrates this by creating a diagnostic test of car images using deep learning algorithms in real time. The process of working together with humans and computers allows the algorithm to learn and improve on its own.

In this section, Jeremy Howard discusses the incredible potential and overwhelming implications of deep learning, showcasing how machine learning and humans can work together in the medical field to enhance efficiency and build solutions that require extensive amounts of data. However, he also examines the problems that come with this capability, highlighting how 80% of employment in services will be automated, and jobs will have to adjust to the change in labor. Howard further discusses how human performance grows at a gradual rate, but deep learning grows exponentially, making it necessary for us to consider its effects on social and economic structures.
