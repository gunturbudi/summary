# Summary of The Future of Early Cancer Detection? | Jorge Soto | TED Talks

In the future, early cancer detection will become easier and less expensive, thanks to advances in technology. Jorge Soto and his team have developed a blood test that can detect several types of cancer at an early stage, through the regulation of gene expression. This technology is being democratized, making it easier for teams of scientists from different disciplines to work together to find new ways to combat cancer.

Jorge Soto discusses the potential of microRNA as a biomarker for early cancer detection. He explains that microRNAs are small, similar molecules that can be difficult to differentiate and that his team has found a way to detect them using a low-cost, 3D-printed device. They are currently doing a clinical trial in collaboration with the German Cancer Research Center to identify microRNA patterns in breast cancer.
