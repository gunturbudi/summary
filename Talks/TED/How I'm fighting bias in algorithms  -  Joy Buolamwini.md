# Summary of How I'm fighting bias in algorithms | Joy Buolamwini

Joy Buolamwini talks about the dangers of algorithmic bias in facial recognition technology and predictive policing. She discusses how biased algorithms can lead to unfair outcomes and a negative impact on people's lives. To address this issue, she proposes the "incoding" movement, which involves inclusive coding practices, building bias-identifying platforms, and creating more inclusive training sets. Joy also launched the Algorithmic Justice League to encourage people to fight against biased algorithms.

In this section, Joy Buolamwini shares her personal experiences with the limitations of facial recognition technology due to algorithmic bias. She explains that computer vision uses machine learning techniques to do facial recognition, which involves creating training sets with examples of faces. However, if the training sets are not diverse enough, any face that deviates too much from the norm will be harder to detect. She discusses how algorithmic bias can lead to exclusionary experiences and discriminatory practices, such as how police departments in the US are using facial recognition software in their crime-fighting, which is not yet audited for accuracy and can lead to misidentification. Joy emphasizes the importance of creating full-spectrum training sets that reflect a diverse range of humanity to prevent such unfairness.

In this section, Joy Buolamwini discusses the potential dangers of biased algorithms, which are being used to make decisions in areas like facial recognition technology and predictive policing. She explains that these algorithms can lead to unfair outcomes that breach civil liberties and have a negative impact on people's lives. To combat this problem, she proposes the "incoding" movement that focuses on inclusive coding practices, building platforms that can identify bias, and creating more inclusive training sets. She has launched the Algorithmic Justice League as a way for people to get involved and fight against the coded gaze.
