# Summary of Rajesh Rao: Computing a Rosetta Stone for the Indus script

Rajesh Rao discusses the work that he and his collaborators have done in decoding the Indus script. They have found that the script is right to left, the symbols typically occur in groups, and the computer model has been successful in 75% of predictions. These findings may help in deciphering the script.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
The Indus script is undeciphered and difficult to read, but it has been used to stamp clay tags that were attached to bundles of goods. There is disagreement over what the symbols mean, with some believing they are Indo-European and others believing they are from the Dravidian language family. There is also disagreement over whether the Indus people were the ancestors of people living in South India today.

Rajesh Rao describes his work decoding the Indus script, which is a difficult task due to the lack of a Rosetta Stone and the short, choppy text. He and his collaborators have found that the direction of writing is right to left, the symbols typically occur in groups, and the computer model has been successful in 75% of predictions. These findings may help in deciphering the script.

The Indus script has been found to fall within the range of linguistic scripts, and it shares an important property with language: it can encode multiple languages. In order to read the script, researchers need to figure out the sounds of the symbols.

Rajesh Rao discusses the discovery of a possible Dravidian language script on seals from the Indus Valley Civilization. If this script is validated, it would provide evidence that the Indus Valley Civilization was home to a people with a culture and language similar to those of the South Indians and the North Indians.
