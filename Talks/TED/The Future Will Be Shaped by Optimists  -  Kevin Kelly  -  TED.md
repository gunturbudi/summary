# Summary of The Future Will Be Shaped by Optimists | Kevin Kelly | TED

In this TED talk, Kevin Kelly argues that optimism is important for two reasons: first, because it is the "default human condition" and second, because problems are the "conduit of progress." He cites examples of progress, such as the eradication of smallpox, and argues that optimism is based on historical data. He urges people to be optimistic about the future, and to understand that the progress made so far is not likely to continue indefinitely.

Kevin Kelly argues that because progress has been made in the past, and bad things happen faster than good things, we should be optimistic about the future. He cites examples of progress, such as the eradication of smallpox, and the fact that bad things happen less frequently than good things. He argues that optimism is not a blind attitude to the realities of the world, but is based on historical data. He urges people to be optimistic about the future, and to understand that the progress made so far is not likely to continue indefinitely.

Kevin Kelly argues that optimism is important for two reasons: first, because it is the "default human condition" and second, because problems are the "conduit of progress." He argues that most of the problems we face today are the result of our solutions to problems in the past, and that there is no limit to how much we can improve. He encourages people to be optimistic, because it is the "default human condition" and it helps us to shape the future in a positive way.
