# Summary of Neil MacGregor: 2600 years of history in one object

In this YouTube video, Neil MacGregor discusses the Cyrus cylinder, a clay object that contains a declaration by King Cyrus, who conquered Babylon without a fight and made himself out to be a great and powerful king who would bring freedom to the people. The cylinder allowed cultural and religious differences to be respected and showed how to run a diverse society peacefully, creating the first multicultural, multifaith state. This was admired by the Founding Fathers of the United States, including Jefferson, speaking to the 18th-century ideals of religious tolerance in a new state. The cylinder has also played a part in the politics of different countries, including Britain, Israel, and Iran. Iranians used it as a symbol of their identity and tolerance of all faiths after the Iran-Iraq War, with millions of people drawn to it in a few months. It continues to be a topic of debate about shaping different Irans and the future of the region.
