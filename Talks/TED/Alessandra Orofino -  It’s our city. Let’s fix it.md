Rio de Janeiro is one of the most violent and poverty-ridden cities in Brazil, and its young people are facing many challenges. Alessandra Orofino, a 20- to 29-year-old woman, is one of those young people. She started a campaign to save her public school from demolition, and her school actually ranks among the best in the country. Jovita, a mother whose daughter went missing 10 years ago, has also found support from the Our Cities network. Leandro, a slum dweller, has created a recycling project that has prevented an eviction. These stories make Alessandra happy because they show that even in the face of immense challenges, ordinary people can make a difference.
