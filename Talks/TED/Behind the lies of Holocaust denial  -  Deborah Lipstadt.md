# Summary of Behind the lies of Holocaust denial | Deborah Lipstadt

Deborah Lipstadt discusses Holocaust denial, describing it as a form of revisionism that uses Nazi-style rhetoric and tries to rewrite history to downplay the crimes of the Nazis. She shares two examples of what she found when doing her research: that deniers are Nazis in sheep's clothing, and that they have an "Institute for Historical Review" and a "Journal of Historical Review" filled with revisionist papers. Lipstadt argues that truth is not relative, and that we must use direct confrontation to expose Holocaust deniers for the liars that they are.
