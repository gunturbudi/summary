# Summary of The Beauty of What We'll Never Know | Pico Iyer | TED

Pico Iyer in his TED talk, "The Beauty of What We'll Never Know," talks about the importance of acknowledging what we don't know rather than clinging to the illusion of knowledge. He draws on the examples of the Dalai Lama and Nobel Prize-winning economist Daniel Kahneman, both of whom stress the importance of admitting ignorance. Iyer argues that it is in the unknown, rather than the known, that true intimacy and growth can be found. Surrendering to the unknown can lead to powerful transformations and, ultimately, reminds us that being human is more important than having complete knowledge.

In this section, the speaker shares his experience of venturing out and discovering things that were uncertain and surprising to him. He talks about a time when he traveled to Myanmar and was invited into the home of a man who offered to show him around. The two men found common ground in their shared love of foreign cultures. In the home, the man shows the speaker a box filled with letters from visitors and pasted snapshots. This experience taught the speaker the secret point of travel - to plunge inward and go to places one would never go otherwise. The opposite of knowledge, he says, isn't always ignorance; it can be wonder, mystery, and possibility.
