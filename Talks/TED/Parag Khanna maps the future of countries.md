In this section, the speaker discusses the relevance of nations and borders in the world despite the interconnectedness of spaces, highlighting how 90% of the world's population still lives in one place and why this basic political geography needs a deeper understanding of how people, money, power, religion, culture, and technology interact to shape the world's map. The maps of the past and present demonstrate how new countries were created over time, and in the context of Eastern Eurasia, he explains the implications of the demographic shift in Russia as a result of the government's infrastructure investment in the far east while also discussing how China is buying Mongolia's resources and people are moving north to Siberia.

In this section, the speaker discusses China's globalization model that involves establishing hierarchies and empires in the Far East. China has become the hub of global capital, and many countries in the region such as Australia, Japan, and Korea have become dependent on it. China has also signed military and diplomatic agreements and has been promoting ethnic Chinese people to occupy greater heights of the economies in other countries. There is a greater co-prosperity sphere emerging in the region, which is much more fluid and imperial. On the other hand, the speaker proposes state-building day by day, starting with Iraq, where the oil-rich Kurdistan region has the potential to have its own statehood if it can control its pipelines.
