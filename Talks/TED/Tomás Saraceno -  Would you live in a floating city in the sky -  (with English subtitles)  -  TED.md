# Summary of TomaÃÅs Saraceno: Would you live in a floating city in the sky? (with English subtitles) | TED

Tomas Saraceno discusses his Aerocene project, which aims to create a new era focused on ecological awakening and an ethical commitment to the atmosphere and the planet. He describes the use of wind and solar power to fly around the world without emitting pollutants and using spherical sculptures to create gardens in the air. Saraceno sees these constructions as a way to overcome political, social, cultural, and military restrictions and to celebrate the air as a symbol of a peaceful, inclusive, and equal global society. He encourages taking smaller steps towards the Aerocene era by becoming independent from fossil fuels and celebrating Air Day.

In this section, artist Tomas Saraceno describes his inspiration for creating a floating museum made of used plastic bags and how that idea led to the emerging era of the "Aerocene." Saraceno discusses his desire to create an ecological awakening and to build an ethical commitment to the atmosphere and the planet. Furthermore, he explains that the Aero-Solar museum can lift people up in a simple, clean, and accessible way without using any fossil fuels, helium, or hydrogen, and how it is possible to float in the air and live in the clouds. The Aerocene project aims to create a new era to replace the violence of the Anthropocene.

In this section, Tomas Saraceno discusses the possibility of using wind to fly around the world without emitting any pollutant. He also talks about using his spherical sculptures that rely only on the sun to create gardens in the air, which could become a transnational space where we could learn to navigate and inhabit. Such constructions, according to him, could be a solution to overcome our political, social, cultural, and military restrictions and help us celebrate the air and make it a symbol of peaceful, inclusive, and equal global society.

In this section, Tomas Saraceno encourages us to take smaller, yet radically different steps towards the Aerocene era. He believes these steps, which started with a bag full of air and wishes, can lead us to independence from fossil fuels and the opportunity to celebrate Air Day. By taking these steps together, we will be able to learn to float with our feet on the ground and go much further than the moon.
