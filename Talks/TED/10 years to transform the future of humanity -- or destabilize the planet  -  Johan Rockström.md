Johan Rockström, a Swedish environmental scientist, warns of the dangers of humanity's continued reliance on fossil fuels, and urges the need for a transformation in society and in how we use energy to avert a potential planetary disaster. He outlines two fronts on which this transformation must take place: in science, where we need to find new ways to sustain the planet, and in society, where we need to develop new economic models based on sustainable practices.
