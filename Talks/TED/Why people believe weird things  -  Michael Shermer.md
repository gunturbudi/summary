# Summary of Why people believe weird things | Michael Shermer

Michael Shermer, director of the Skeptics Society and publisher of Skeptic magazine, explains in a YouTube video why people believe weird things. He argues that our natural tendency to see patterns and forget misses leads us to believe in phenomena like psychics, astrologers, and tarot card readers. He emphasizes the importance of using a scientific way of thinking, which involves looking for natural explanations for all phenomena. Shermer also gives examples of how a balance between data and theory is needed to draw scientific conclusions, and performs a demonstration to show how people can be primed to believe in supernatural phenomena based on preconceived notions.
