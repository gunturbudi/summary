# Summary of What really happens when you mix medications? | Russ Altman

In this video, Russ Altman discusses the complexities of studying drug interactions and how traditional methods of understanding interactions are usually insufficient. He shares a story of a student who used the FDA's adverse event database to create a classifier that predicts how drugs change glucose levels in patients, and how the student found a strong signal for paroxetine and pravastatin together. Altman also talks about his study on the interaction between these two drugs and how they affect glucose levels. He emphasizes the importance of using big data and medium-sized data to help understand drug actions and interactions and optimize their use, but notes that, as most patients are on multiple drugs, there is a lot more to discover about how these drugs interact with each other. However, Altman believes that we should continue using big data sources, even with privacy and security concerns, to find more productive drug interactions that can better treat our patients.

In this section, the speaker explains how studying the interactions between medications is complicated and traditionally not done. They explain that post-marketing surveillance is the only hope of understanding interactions, and shares a story of how a student leveraged the FDA's adverse event database to create a classifier that can predict how drugs change glucose levels in patients. The student also found a strong signal for paroxetine and pravastatin together. As millions of Americans take those two drugs and many take multiple medications, it is crucial that big data and data science are used to better understand how different drugs interact and can be used safely together.

In this section, Russ Altman talks about his study on the interaction between two drugs, paroxetine and pravastatin, and how they affect glucose levels. Initially, they found 10 patients with glucose bumping up 20 milligrams per deciliter after they started taking both drugs, but they weren't satisfied with such a small number. They then analyzed electronic medical records from Stanford, Harvard, and Vanderbilt and found 150 patients with similar conditions. They submitted the paper, and it was accepted based on the evidence alone. Still, they decided to feed mice the two drugs and discovered a similar effect on glucose levels. However, Altman was also interested in whether patients were experiencing side effects of hyperglycemia but needed to ask Google to provide their search logs, which they refused. Instead, they used Bing searches, and for 18 months, they collected data from individuals searching for words related to hyperglycemia.

In this section, Russ Altman discusses how big data and medium-sized data can help us understand drug actions and interactions. He shares a study that analyzed search data to see how frequently diabetes-related phrases were searched when paired with certain drug names. The study showed that patients are indirectly telling us about side effects through their searches. Altman says this creates a new ecosystem for understanding how drugs work and optimizing their use. However, he also notes that as most patients are on multiple drugs, there's a lot more to discover about how these drugs interact with each other. Altman believes we should continue using big data sources, even with privacy and security concerns, to find more productive drug interactions that can better treat our patients.
