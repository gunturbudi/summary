# Summary of Why paternity leave benefits everyone | The Way We Work, a TED series

The video discusses the importance of paternity leave and normalizing it. The speaker from Japan explains that despite offering 12 months of paid parental leave for both parents, only seven percent of fathers take paternity leave due to work pressures. Paternity leave allows fathers to bond with their children and provide emotional support for mothers, reducing the risk of postpartum depression. It can also promote gender equality in the workforce and boost productivity. Another speaker argues that a culture that values men as caretakers and creates systems allowing for both parents to take childcare leave can break free from patriarchal restrictions and lead to higher levels of happiness overall.

In this section, a man from Japan discusses his experience with taking paternity leave and why it is important to normalize it. He explains that despite Japan offering 12 months of paid parental leave for both mothers and fathers, only seven percent of fathers take paternity leave and three-quarters take a leave of two weeks or less due to pressure at work. Taking paternity leave allows fathers to bond with their children and become more engaged in the first few years of their child's life, as well as provide emotional support for mothers, which reduces the risk of postpartum depression. Moreover, paternity leave can have a profound impact on gender equality in the workforce, and men taking paternity leave can give women more options to rise into leadership roles. Finally, he explains that companies that offer paid family leave report a positive impact on morale and a boost in productivity, making paternity leave good for society overall.

In this section, the speaker argues that countries that have higher rates of paternity leave and that foster gender equality tend to have higher levels of happiness overall. She suggests that a patriarchal system, which systematically favors men, also restricts them in a cage, limiting their ability to be active caretakers in their children's lives. To break free from this, we need to build a culture that values men as caretakers and creates systems that allow for both parents to take paid childcare leave.
