In this section, Sheena Iyengar talks about the overwhelming number of choices that people make and how it leads to the choice overload problem. She shares her experience at an upscale grocery store with 348 different kinds of jam and reveals that people were six times more likely to buy jam when they encountered six flavors than when they encountered 24 flavors. This choice overload problem affects people even in consequential decisions such as financial savings as people choose not to choose, even when it goes against their best self-interests.

In this section, Sheena Iyengar, a professor at Columbia Business School, outlines four techniques that can make choosing easier. First, concretization, which makes people understand the differences between choices by helping them understand the consequences associated with each choice in a vivid and concrete way. Second, categorization, which enables more information to be handled by dividing choices into categorical groups that are meaningful to the choosers. Third, condition for complexity, which gradually increases complexity and the number of choices that a person can handle leading to better engagement. Fourth, condition for complexity, which gradually improves the order of information presentation, leading to better engagement when choosing.
