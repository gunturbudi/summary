# Summary of Rob Hopkins: Transition to a world without oil

Rob Hopkins discusses the challenges we face as we move from a time of oil abundance to oil vulnerability, and the importance of developing a transition response focused on resilience rather than sustainability. He outlines the characteristics of the transition response and the need to build modularity and surge breakers into our basic support systems, citing the Transition model as an example of community-based initiatives for building resilience. Hopkins emphasizes the importance of telling stories that help communities creatively move forward towards a post-oil future, highlighting examples of communities that have built resilience by producing their own currency, creating food gardens, and founding energy companies. He encourages communities to reduce carbon emissions and build resilience in all aspects of their lives.

In this section, Rob Hopkins gives a visual demonstration of a liter of oil and explains how it contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks of hard human manual labor, equivalent to about 35 strong people working for you. This marvel of the modern age has allowed us to design settlements, business models, transport plans, and the idea of economic growth based on the assumption that we will have it in perpetuity. However, we are moving from a time of oil abundance to oil vulnerability as the amount of oil discovered per barrel consumed continues to widen, and the energy extracted from oil is falling, leading us to scramble for new frontiers in oil extraction. As we face the challenge of going down the other side of the energy mountain, we need to come up with thinking that is based on a realistic assessment of where we are, before we lose the benefits we take for granted.

In this section, Rob Hopkins explores the idea of stories and how they help shape our understanding of the past and future. He looks back on the stories people used to tell before cheap oil and fossil fuels were available, and how these stories represent a kind of energy that is unimaginable to people today. He then discusses the four stories we tell ourselves about where we're going: business as usual, hitting the wall, technology can solve everything, and the transition response. Hopkins outlines the characteristics of the transition response, including its solutions-focused, self-organizing, and historic nature, and how it is centered on the idea of resilience, which is a more useful concept than sustainability.

In this section, Rob Hopkins explains that resilience runs much deeper than just focusing on energy efficiency and packaging of products. He states that we need to build modularity and surge breakers into how we organize basic things that support us, as only this can truly create a sustainable and resilient system. Hopkins then explains how Transition idea works, where people come together, start awareness programs, create working groups, and initiate various projects to transition their communities. Among the many projects that emerge are local food schemes, urban food production, energy companies, waste reduction, recycling, and various others. Hopkins highlights the importance of creating vibrant and self-sufficient communities, which would make it easier for international and national responses to be implemented.  Hopkins also mentions the importance of stories in this transition process.

In this section, speaker Rob Hopkins highlights the importance of telling stories that help communities move forward creatively towards a post-oil future. He gives examples of communities that have produced their own currency, converted car parks into food gardens, and founded their own energy companies. Hopkins also highlights the Obamas' initiative to create a vegetable garden at the White House, which led to the creation of 20 million vegetable gardens across the US. He encourages communities to build resilience while drastically reducing carbon emissions in all aspects of their lives. Hopkins acknowledges the benefits of living in the age of cheap oil but emphasizes the need to move forward towards a more resilient and connected world.
