In this section, Max Rashbrooke discusses three potential upgrades to democracy for the 21st century. The first is the idea of a citizen's assembly, where a group of 100 citizens who are representative of the country as a whole come together to deeply discuss an issue and come to a state of consensus recommendations. The second is participatory budgeting, where communities come together to decide on how to allocate a portion of their city council's budget to best serve the needs of the community. The third component is online consensus-forming, which has been used in Taiwan to facilitate high-quality public discussions and generate recommendations for the regulation of services like Uber.
