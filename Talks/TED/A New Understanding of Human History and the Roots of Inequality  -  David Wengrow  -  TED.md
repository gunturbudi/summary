David Wengrow argues that the traditional understanding of human history, which sees the invention of agriculture as leading to the development of rigid social classes and the emergence of civilizations, is not accurate. He suggests that what happened after the invention of agriculture was a period of around 4,000 years of villages largely remaining villages. There is little evidence for the emergence of civilizations during this time, and technological change proceeded apace. He argues that the concept of civilization is ambiguous and doesn't adequately describe the long spans of human history.

He also discusses the recent archaeological discoveries that show that human societies before the agricultural revolution were far more diverse and complex than previously thought.

The speaker discusses evidence that shows that large-scale societies, including cities, have existed in human history before the advent of agriculture. He argues that it is not necessarily necessary for societies to have a top-down structure in order to be successful, and that it is possible for participatory democracy to work well in small communities. He suggests that it is not too late to learn from the past and create new, egalitarian societies.
