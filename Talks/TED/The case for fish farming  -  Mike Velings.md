# Summary of The case for fish farming | Mike Velings

The global population needs at least 70 percent more protein by 2050, but our overfishing has decimated marine life, leading to global unrest and malnutrition. The solution lies in aquaculture or fish farming, which offers healthy and diverse protein options while alleviating the pressure on the ocean. While there have been issues with excessive use of chemicals and unsustainable feed ingredients, new technologies and knowledge have led to sustainable and healthy fish farming practices that produce delicious and natural feed ingredients like microbes, insects, seaweeds, and micro-algae. The speaker emphasizes that if people demand more sustainable fish farming practices, the industry will listen and improve, leading to benefits for all.

In this section, the speaker describes the impending protein crisis due to a growing global population that needs at least 70 percent more protein by 2050. While the ocean serves as the primary source of animal protein, our overfishing has decimated the global marine life, leading to global unrest and malnutrition. The solution lies in aquaculture or fish farming, which offers healthy and diverse protein options while alleviating the pressure on the ocean. Fish is not only healthy, but it also prevents heart disease and provides key fatty acids like Omega-3s that other meat cannot.

In this section, the speaker talks about the importance of fish farming for meeting the increasing demands of the growing population. He highlights that fish farming can be done in a very healthy and efficient manner that is good for the planet, and fish make the most resource-efficient animal protein available to humans. However, the speaker also points out the negative impact of badly managed fisheries, which are destroying the oceans and are connected to some of the worst slavery issues imaginable. The speaker also mentions that a shift to plant-based alternatives can be a sustainable and ethical solution to meet the growing demand for fish farming.

In this section, Mike Velings, a co-founder of Aqua-Spark, makes the case for fish farming and debunks common misconceptions about the industry. While there have been issues with excessive use of chemicals and unsustainable feed ingredients, new technologies and knowledge have led to sustainable and healthy fish farming practices that produce delicious and natural feed ingredients like microbes, insects, seaweeds, and micro-algae. Velings emphasizes that this revolution in fish farming is possible at a cost competitive with current methods, and it is up to consumers to ask questions about how their seafood is produced and put pressure on the aquaculture industry to do the right thing.

This final section of the talk is a call to action for the consumers to be more mindful of what they eat and where it comes from, encouraging them to ask for information and show that they care. The speaker emphasizes that if people demand more sustainable fish farming practices, the industry will listen and improve, leading to benefits for all. The talk concludes with a message of thanks and applause from the audience.
