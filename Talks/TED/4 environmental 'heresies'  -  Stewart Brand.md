# Summary of 4 environmental 'heresies' | Stewart Brand

Stewart Brand gives four "environmental heresies" in his video. Firstly, he claims that squatters in developing world cities are helping create prosperity, rather than undermining it. Secondly, Brand argues that cities are green and diffuse the population bomb. Thirdly, he argues that nuclear energy, particularly microreactors, has been unfairly demonized by environmentalists, and genetically modified foods have more environmental benefits than disadvantages. Finally, he suggests four geoengineering ideas to help tackle climate change, and encourages humans to take responsibility for their impact and become better stewards of the planet.

In this section, Stewart Brand talks about the rapid urbanization happening predominantly in the developing world. With the villages emptying out due to lack of opportunities, people are following opportunity into town where they see a cash economy that they were not able to participate in back in the subsistence farm. The squatters now building the urban world are intensely creative and valuable as a group. They start flimsy and they get substantial as time goes by, and even build their own infrastructure. It is not the case that slums undermine prosperity; they help create prosperity. People are busy getting out of poverty just as fast as they can and they're using the informal economy to do so.

In this section, Stewart Brand discusses the importance of cities and the urbanization of the world. He explains that cities are green because when people leave the poverty trap of subsistence farms, the natural environment starts to come back rapidly, and those who remain can shift over to cash crops to send food to the new growing markets in town. Cities also diffuse the population bomb as people immediately have fewer children when they move to cities, and this birth rate declines rapidly. However, climate change will keep getting worse faster than we think, leading to a great increase in climate refugees over the coming decades, resource wars, and chaos wars. The solution would be to switch to green baseload electricity like nuclear and hydro instead of coal to save the climate.

In this section, Stewart Brand argues that nuclear energy has been unfairly demonized by environmentalists, who are ignoring the fact that the waste generated by nuclear energy is much smaller than that of coal. He goes on to argue that microreactors, which are much smaller and more adaptable than traditional reactors, are the future of nuclear energy. Stewart also touches on the issue of genetically engineered food, which he believes is harmless and has many environmental benefits. Finally, he discusses geoengineering and suggests that harsh events that are coming might force us to consider geoengineering, but it raises complex moral questions, as we don't know who gets to decide how much to do and where to do it.

In this section, Stewart Brand presents four geoengineering ideas, including releasing sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere or atomizing seawater to brighten the reflectance of ocean clouds. He also suggests copying the ancient Amazon Indians by pyrolizing plant waste, as biochar fixes large quantities of carbon while also improving soil quality. Brand suggests that humans are in an era called the Anthropocene, where we are responsible for the environment and must live up to our obligations to make it better. Ultimately, Brand encourages humanity to get better at being "as gods" and take responsibility for their impact on the planet.
