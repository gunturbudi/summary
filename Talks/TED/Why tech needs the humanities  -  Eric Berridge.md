In this section, Eric Berridge argues against the notion that the future workforce will be dominated by STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math), contending that the humanities are just as important. He suggests that modern systems are intuitive and easy to learn, and operating them requires far less education than in the past. Additionally, the skills that are vital in a world with intuitive technology involve envisioning the end product and working together as humans. The sciences teach us how to build things, but the humanities teach us what to build and why we should build them. Berridge argues that the humanities deserve an equal footing with the sciences, and while tech companies require engineers, building a tech firm with artists can produce an incredible outcome.

It is crucial to have people from different professions like marketers, lawyers, HR specialists, etc. that have a variety of personality traits like introverts and extroverts. Furthermore, the accessibility of technology frees up the workforce to study whatever they want, leading to a more diverse and well-rounded group of individuals.
