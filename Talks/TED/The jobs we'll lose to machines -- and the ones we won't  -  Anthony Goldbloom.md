# Summary of The jobs we'll lose to machines -- and the ones we won't | Anthony Goldbloom

Anthony Goldbloom discusses the impact of machine learning on jobs, where machines can outperform humans in frequent, high-volume tasks like essay grading and loan application assessment but cannot keep up with humans in tackling novel situations. The future state of any job depends on how reducible it is to frequent, high-volume tasks versus how much it involves tackling novel situations. Machines will shrink the ranks of jobs like accountants and lawyers but humans will still be needed for complex tax structuring and pathbreaking litigation. Meanwhile, humans will be the ones creating marketing copy and developing business strategy, which require creativity and problem-solving skills.

In this section, Anthony Goldbloom discusses the impact of machine learning on jobs and how machines are capable of outperforming humans in frequent, high-volume tasks like essay grading, loan application assessment, mail sorting, and diagnosing certain diseases. However, where machines cannot keep up with humans is in tackling novel situations that they have not seen many times before. Humans can connect seemingly disparate ideas to solve problems they've never seen before. Thus, the future state of any single job largely depends on how reducible it is to frequent, high-volume tasks versus how much it involves tackling novel situations. While accountants and lawyers may still be needed for complex tax structuring and pathbreaking litigation, machines will shrink their ranks and make these jobs harder to come by. On the other hand, humans will be the ones creating copy for marketing campaigns and developing business strategy, which require creativity and problem-solving skills.
