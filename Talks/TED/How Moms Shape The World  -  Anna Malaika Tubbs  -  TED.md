In this section, the speaker discusses the erasure of mothers, particularly Alberta Christine Williams King, in historical narratives and media. She emphasizes the critical role that mothers play in society and how lack of attention to their contributions leads to a lack of support and resources for mothers. The speaker argues that shifting our perspective of motherhood on a cultural level through storytelling can make life better for everyone, especially mothers of color who historically have received the least resources. She highlights the life story of Alberta King, who was born into a family of leaders and activists and believed in intertwining Christian faith with social justice.

In this section, three stories are shared about Black mothers who shaped the world through their activism and nurturing. The first is Alberta Williams King, who became a talented organizer and musician but was forced to abandon her teaching career due to the law stating that married women couldn't teach. The second is Louise Langdon Little, an activist who raised eight children, including Malcolm X, and was institutionalized against her will for 25 years. The third is Berdis Jones Baldwin, a single mother of nine who endured abuse, raised her children on her own, and inspired her first-born, James Baldwin. These stories are a testament to the struggles and strengths of Black mothers who have been disrespected and erased for too long.

In this section, Tubbs calls for a change in the way we treat and talk about mothers. Instead of seeing them as selfless beings who sacrifice their own needs for others, we should recognize them as leaders, caretakers, and teachers. This includes celebrating stay-at-home moms and recognizing mothering as the ultimate test of multitasking, organization, and empathy. Tubbs also highlights the need for more stories, books, TV shows, and movies that accurately represent mothers and the importance of policies such as parental leave, affordable child care, unbiased health care systems, and even a guaranteed income. By changing the narrative, we can create a more equitable world for everyone.
