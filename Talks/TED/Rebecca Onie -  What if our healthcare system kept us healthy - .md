# Summary of Rebecca Onie: What if our healthcare system kept us healthy?

Rebecca Onie, the co-founder of Health Leads, discusses the need for a healthcare system that focuses on keeping patients healthy, rather than just treating symptoms. She suggests that healthcare must transition towards helping patients with non-medical issues, such as nutritional deprivation, as these can be root causes of illness. Health Leads connects patients with the resources they need to be healthy, including nutritious food and exercise programs. Onie believes that the waiting room can be used as an opportunity to connect patients to these resources and create a next-generation healthcare leadership pipeline by involving community health workers, case managers and college students. She advocates for a system in which quality healthcare is measured by the prevention of disease and the system's frequency of use, rather than its technological advancements.

In this section, Rebecca Onie recounts her experiences as an intern at Greater Boston Legal Services during her freshman year of college. Inspired by the lives of low-income families in Boston, she reached out to Dr. Barry Zuckerman, who was the Chair of Pediatrics at Boston Medical Center, and discovered that many of the medical issues he saw in his patients stemmed from non-medical issues such as nutritional deprivation, which healthcare providers did not have the time or resources to address. This led to the creation of Health Leads, which allows healthcare providers to prescribe nutritious food and basic resources the same way they prescribe medication. Today, the program has a thousand college student advocates working to connect nearly 9,000 patients and their families with the resources they need to be healthy.

In this section of the video, Rebecca Onie discusses her experience with healthcare and how healthcare must transition from just treating the disease towards making patients healthier. She asks the audience questions about what it takes to have a healthcare system that keeps patients healthy and why they aren't doing it. Her belief is that it's almost too painful to articulate our aspirations for our healthcare system, and we don't admit that we have any at all. Onie encourages the audience to listen quietly because they all share a similar set of desires, and if we are honest with ourselves, we all want the healthcare system that keeps us healthy. She talks about how her organization, Health Leads, began with a prescription pad to figure out what patients needed to be healthy instead of just treating the symptoms. They're now working to automate the prescription process in electronic medical records so that patients can connect to healthy food and exercise programs within their communities. Rebecca believes that Health Leads transforms the electronic medical record from a static repository of diagnostic information into a health promotion tool.

In this section, Rebecca Onie discusses the concept of using the waiting room not just as a place where patients sit when theyâ€™re unwell, but also as an area where they can go to get healthy instead. Health Leads seeks to connect patients to the resources they need to be healthy by reclaiming waiting room real estate and time. Onie suggests that a broader workforce is necessary to achieve good health, including community health workers, case managers and college students. Health Leads is based on the belief that college students can make a significant impact on vulnerable communities by recruiting and training them as a kind of Teach for America for the healthcare system. The goal is to mobilize them to help patients with their basic health needs, creating a next-generation healthcare leadership pipeline.

In this section, Rebecca Onie shares how she was encouraged by a rabbi to pursue her vision to develop a more efficient healthcare system that prioritizes preventive measures rather than disease curing or treatment. She believes that quality healthcare should be measured in terms of diseases that were prevented rather than diseases cured or technological advancements. Moreover, she believes that the performance of the healthcare system should be evaluated based on how frequently it was required rather than by what it was initially designed.
