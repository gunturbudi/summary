# Summary of Leather and meat without killing animals | Andras Forgacs

Andras Forgacs proposes the idea of biofabrication as a sustainable and humane way to produce animal products like meat and leather without harming animals. He emphasizes the potential of growing leather from animal cells, which involves multiplying skin cells in a culture medium to produce collagen, the main building block of leather. The process allows for the creation of multilayered skin, which is then put through a tanning process to create high-quality leather. The resulting product is versatile, as it can be grown to any shape, and eliminates the negative side-effects of traditional leather production. Forgacs highlights the environmental impact and ethical concerns of raising animals for their products and suggests biofabrication as a more viable alternative.

In this section, Andras Forgacs talks about the idea of growing animal products like meat and leather using biofabrication - a technique used to grow tissues and organs from cells. He discusses the environmental impact and ethical concerns of raising animals for their products, and suggests biofabrication as a more sustainable and humane alternative. He emphasizes leather as a good starting point for the new industry, as it is technically simpler to grow than meat and less polarizing for consumers and regulators. He explains the process of growing leather from animal cells, which involves taking skin cells and multiplying them in a culture medium to produce collagen, the main building block of leather.

In this section, Andras Forgacs explains how they create genuine, high-quality leather in a lab without animal sacrifice. They start by taking a few cells from an animal, then put them in a nutrient-rich soup where they multiply until they become tissue layers. A multilayered skin is then created, which they put through a tanning process to create leather. This new leather has all the characteristics of traditional leather but without the negative side-effects of removing scars, insect bites, hair or waste. It is also more versatile than regular leather and can be grown to any shape, allowing for more creative freedom. Andras Forgacs further explains how biofabrication may be the way forward for more sustainable, environmentally-friendly and humane manufacturing of animal products such as meat and leather.
