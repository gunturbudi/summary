# Summary of Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality | Anil Seth

Anil Seth discusses the mystery of consciousness and how the brain generates our perception of reality in this YouTube video. He argues that consciousness emerges from within the brain due to its biological machinery and that what we experience is a controlled hallucination based on sensory input and perceptual predictions. The sense of self is also a construct of the brain and can be fragmented through different experiences. Seth demonstrates this using the rubber hand illusion and highlights the importance of interoception. He presents three implications of how our brains construct our reality, including the potential for treating psychiatric and neurological conditions, the impossibility of uploading consciousness to computers or robots, and the uniqueness of our individual experiences rooted in shared biological mechanisms.

In this section, Anil Seth explains how the process of anesthesia and the consciousness it brings up reveals the mystery of how the human brain generates consciousness. He explains that consciousness happens as billions of neurons in each brain generate a conscious experience. The depth of this consciousness mystery is so great that some people believe it can never be fully explained by science. Seth has dedicated much of his life to studying consciousness and believes that science is the key to understanding consciousness. He believes that consciousness emerges from within the brain because of the biological machinery that makes up the brain.

In this section of the video, Seth explains that perception is not solely based on external sensory information, but also depends on perceptual predictions generated from within the brain's circuits. The brain's best guess of what's out there in the world is often mistaken, which Seth illustrates through optical illusions and speech distortion. Seth argues that what we experience as reality is actually a controlled hallucination, and that the sense of self is also a construction of the brain that can be fragmented through different experiences.

In this section, Anil Seth discusses how our brain generates the experience of having a body and being a self. Using the rubber hand illusion, he shows that the brain makes its best guess about what is and what is not part of its body. He also highlights the importance of interoception- the perception and regulation of the internal state of the body. Unlike our experiences of the external world, we don't perceive our internal bodily organs as objects in the world- they're about control and regulation rather than figuring out what's there. Overall, our experiences of the world and ourselves are kinds of controlled hallucinations that have been shaped by millions of years of evolution to keep us alive in both dangerous and opportunistic environments.

In this section, Anil Seth presents three implications of how our brains construct our reality. Firstly, understanding that the mechanisms of prediction can go wrong and cause us to misperceive ourselves and the world around us has huge potential for treating conditions in psychiatry and neurology. Secondly, the fact that we are biological organisms means that we cannot simply upload our consciousness to computers or robots, as true sentience only arises from these biological mechanisms. Finally, our individual consciousness is just one possible way of experiencing the world, and our uniqueness as individuals is grounded in biological mechanisms shared with other living creatures, leading to a greater sense of wonder and connectedness with the natural world.
