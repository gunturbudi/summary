# Summary of Where is cybercrime really coming from? | Caleb Barlow

Cybersecurity expert Caleb Barlow discusses the impact of organized criminal gangs in perpetrating cybercrime, accounting for 80% of illegal economies in the world. These gangs operate like regular businesses and offer basic to advanced malware on the Dark Web, with licenses, money-back guarantees, and even ratings and reviews. Barlow proposes changing the economics for these criminals to effectively combat cybercrime. He also calls for collaborative sharing of threat intelligence data, citing IBM's successful publication of actionable data that has been leveraged by over 4,000 organizations to date.

In this section, cyber security expert Caleb Barlow reveals that cybercrime is not only caused by nation-state activity, but mostly by organized criminal gangs, who account for 80% of illegal economies in the world, surpassing the GDP of 160 nations. One specific example is the Dyre Wolf Trojan, which steals banking credentials and operates a fake help desk; thus, tricking victims into providing their identity and authentication information. This illustrates how sophisticated these criminal gangs have become and how vulnerable we all are to cyber attacks.

In this section, the speaker discusses the structure of criminal organizations that perpetrate cybercrime, describing how they operate like regular businesses and peddle their software on the anonymous underbelly of the internet known as the Dark Web. The catalog of services on offer includes everything from basic to advanced malware, and even gold, silver, and bronze levels of service. Just like in a regular marketplace, there are products, prices, ratings, and reviews. The criminals even offer licensing terms and money-back guarantees. He suggests an approach on how to stop cybercrime which is centered on changing the economics for the bad guys.

In this section, cybersecurity expert Caleb Barlow calls for open and collaborative sharing of threat intelligence data in order to effectively combat cybercrime. Barlow argues that organizations are often reluctant to share information about cyber attacks due to concerns about competitive advantage, litigation, or regulation. However, by sharing this information, organizations can effectively inoculate themselves and others against cybercrime. Barlow points to IBM's decision to publish actionable threat intelligence data on the internet as evidence that such sharing can be effective, with over 4,000 organizations leveraging this data to date.
