# Summary of Maryn McKenna: What do we do when antibiotics donâ€™t work any more?

In this talk, Maryn McKenna discusses the current issue of antibiotic resistance, highlighting the severity of the problem and the potential devastating consequences if it is not addressed. She explains how antibiotics were once thought of as miracle drugs but are now becoming ineffective due to bacterial evolution that creates defenses against antibiotics. McKenna argues that humans have accelerated the process of antibiotic resistance through careless use, and she calls for systems to harvest data and higher regulations to combat the problem. She also emphasizes the importance of changing social norms by taking small steps and demanding more information about the source of meat products.

In this section, the speaker recounts the story of her great uncle, who died from a simple infection before antibiotics existed. She then describes how antibiotics were thought of as a miracle drug that could cure infections almost instantly, but now we are entering the post-antibiotic era where simple infections are becoming life-threatening once again due to antibiotic resistance. Bacteria evolve defenses against antibiotics, which has led to widespread resistance in many commonly used antibiotics over the years. The back-and-forth "leapfrog" game of drug and resistance is no longer sustainable, and we need to find new ways to fight and prevent infections.

In this section, the speaker highlights the seriousness of antibiotic resistance, which has led to some infections, such as KPC and NDM, becoming resistant to all but one or no drugs. The number of deaths from infections with no available drugs is estimated to be 50,000 in the US and Europe alone, and a project by the British government called the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance projects that this will soar to 10 million per year worldwide by 2050 if the problem isn't addressed. Antibiotics benefit almost all of modern life, and losing them would mean losing the ability to perform surgery and treat diseases, in addition to severely impacting daily life and causing a significant increase in mortality rates.

In this section, the speaker explains how humans have accelerated the process of antibiotic resistance with the careless use of such drugs. In the United States, antibiotics are unnecessarily used in 50% of hospital patients and 45% of prescriptions written in doctors' offices are for conditions the antibiotics cannot treat. In addition to human use, much of the world's meat animals are given antibiotics daily, primarily to fatten them up and protect them from diseases arising in the factory conditions in which they're raised. Aquaculture and fruit growing also rely on antibiotics. Fleming, who discovered penicillin, predicted this resistance would happen because bacteria can pass their DNA to other bacteria so that once resistance is encouraged, it spreads beyond its origins. To combat the problem, companies are working on novel antibiotics, but evolution always wins. The solution involves having systems to harvest data specifying how antibiotics are being used, gatekeeping drug ordering systems, and higher agricultural use regulations.

In this section, Maryn McKenna argues that changing social norms is key in the fight against antibiotic resistance. She compares it to the way people change their behavior to address climate change or deforestation, taking small steps that can have a big impact. McKenna suggests that people can forgo antibiotics if they are not sure if they are necessary, and that consumers can demand more information about where their meat products come from. She warns that we don't have a lot of time to make these changes, as we have already reached the edge of disaster in just 70 years of antibiotic use.
