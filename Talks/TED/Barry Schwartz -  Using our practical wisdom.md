# Summary of Barry Schwartz: Using our practical wisdom

Barry Schwartz argues in this video that practical wisdom is a virtue that is desperately needed in addition to better rules and smart incentives in society. Practical wisdom involves improvisation, rule-bending, and exception-finding, and is required in interactions with others. However, it's essential that wise practice is carried out in the service of others and not in the service of oneself to avoid ruthless manipulation of others. He cites several examples of people who have transformed flawed systems, including Judge Robert Russell and a banker who created a for-profit community bank that served low-income clients. Schwartz suggests that practical wisdom is required to improve relations with others and engage in meaningful work, and that rules and incentives are no substitute for wisdom in guiding us towards right action.

In this section of the video, Barry Schwartz discusses the general dissatisfaction among people about the way institutions run, including educators, doctors, bankers, and brokers. He offers two kinds of responses: creating more rules and guidelines for behavior, and devising incentives that will motivate people to act in the community's interest. However, Schwartz argues that these two responses are inadequate because they fail to address the core problem: the lack of practical wisdom in our society. Without a sense of practical wisdom, which comes from experience and judgment, rules and incentives will not drive the desired behavior.

In this section, speaker Barry Schwartz discusses the importance of practical wisdom as a virtue that is desperately needed in addition to better rules and smart incentives in society. Practical wisdom, according to Aristotle, is "the moral will to do the right thing and the moral skill to figure out what the right thing is." It involves improvisation, rule-bending and exception-finding, as seen in skilled craftsmen, and is required in interactions with others. However, it's essential that wise practice is carried out in the service of others and not in the service of oneself to avoid ruthless manipulation of others. The example given was of a young guy, Michael, who lost his job and stole 50 dollars at gunpoint but was redeemed by a judge who used practical wisdom to see that a mandatory sentence would only wreck his family.

In this section, two examples are given that demonstrate the subversion of practical wisdom by rigid rules and guidelines that are meant to be helpful, but in reality can demoralize professional activity. The first involves a judge who demonstrated improvisational wisdom by creating her own sentence guidelines, which successfully rehabilitated a convicted criminal and reunited his family, but then had to enforce mandatory minimum sentencing rules when ordered to do so on appeal, losing the rehabilitated criminal once again. The second scenario involved a school teacher who listened to a consultant's advice about how to get more students to pass standardized tests, which included ignoring students that either would pass the test regardless or could not pass the test no matter what they did, which left her unhappy and demoralized. The danger of incentivizing people with rewards or punishments has been known for decades by psychologists, and yet policies are still created using these measures rather than cultivating a system that inspires people to do the right thing for the right reasons.

In this section, the speaker talks about two types of people who can create positive change in flawed systems: canny outlaws and system changers. Canny outlaws are people who navigate around the rules to subvert the system and achieve results. However, they cannot maintain this level of activity for a long time. In contrast, system changers aim to transform the system, not just dodge its rules.  The speaker cites several examples, including Judge Robert Russell, who created a Veterans' Court in the United States that treats each criminal like an individual and helps them rehabilitate themselves. This approach has prevented relapses into the criminal justice system. Finally, the speaker talks about a banker who created a for-profit community bank that served low-income clients and helped revive a struggling community while maintaining profitability.

In this section, Barry Schwartz discusses the need to transform medical education in order to prevent ethical erosion and loss of empathy in medical students. He describes an example from Harvard where third-year medical students are given patients to follow for an entire year, who are viewed as people with lives rather than just diseases or organ systems. This approach fosters effective doctors who have time for the people they treat, and the mentoring between students and doctors creates a generation of practitioners who are true to the mission of the profession. Schwartz suggests that people want to be allowed to be virtuous and have permission to do the right thing, rather than feeling the need to take a shower to get the moral grime off their bodies every day when they come home from work. He highlights that practical wisdom, which he believes is the key to happiness, is required to improve relations with others and engage in meaningful work. Rules and incentives are no substitute for wisdom in guiding us towards right action.
