# Summary of How Your Memory Works -- and Why Forgetting Is Totally OK | Lisa Genova | TED

Lisa Genova, a neuroscientist, talks about how our memory works and why forgetting is actually normal. She explains that our memories are stored in neural networks, and that when we learn new things, we are actually building new neural connections. This is important because it helps us to have a cognitive reserve, which is a back-up system of neural connections that can help us to remember things even if we start to experience some pathology. Genova argues that there is no limit to what humans can learn and remember, no matter their age.

Detail Summary:

Our memory is not perfect, and that's okay. Our brains are not designed to remember everything we encounter. Memory is fallible, and we forget things all the time. The two most common reasons for forgetting are lack of attention and blocked words.

Lisa Genova, a neuroscientist, talks about how our memory works and why forgetting is totally normal. She explains that when we try to retrieve a memory, sometimes we get stuck on the wrong thing (like the wrong name for a person). This is because our brains are organized in a way that makes it difficult to access the correct information. However, we can use Google to look up the information we're trying to remember, and this doesn't weaken our memory.

Lisa Genova explains that forgetting is normal because our memories are connected neural networks of associations. She says that forgetting common words or where you parked your car is not necessarily a sign of Alzheimer's, but if you start forgetting things frequently, it may be something to talk to your doctor about.

Lisa Genova explains that there is no limit to what humans can learn and remember, no matter their age. She cites the example of Akira Haraguchi, a Japanese engineer who learned 100,000 digits of pi at the age of 69. Genova argues that everyone has the same potential to achieve great things if they set their mind to it.
