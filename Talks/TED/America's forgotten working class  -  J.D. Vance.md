In this section, JD Vance talks about how affirmative action seems like a tool to hold the white working class back, as many people with political and financial power are contending against them. Because of this perception, many working-class individuals may not work as hard or go after traditional markers of success because they feel it won't be worth it. Vance stresses the importance of social capital, stating that working-class communities lack access to information about opportunities and education that is needed to succeed in the 21st century. He also notes that many working-class individuals are more likely to face adverse childhood experiences, such as childhood trauma or violence. This results in a continuous cycle of difficulties in education or facing negative outcomes, where children would end up doing to their kids what their parents did to them.

In this section, J.D. Vance discusses his personal journey of beating the odds despite his circumstance of a broken family, low social capital, childhood trauma, and generational poverty. He attributes his success to his grandparents' support, the United States Marine Corps, and his mentors from Ohio State, Yale, and other places. Vance recognizes that he was fortunate to have those people in his life who filled the social capital gap and admits that many kids from low-income backgrounds won't have the same support. Therefore, he raises important questions about how society can help give low-income children access to a loving home, teach parents how to better interact with their children, and give mentorship to those who lack social capital. Vance ends his talk by emphasizing the importance of asking better questions to change the trajectory of many forgotten working-class communities across the country.
