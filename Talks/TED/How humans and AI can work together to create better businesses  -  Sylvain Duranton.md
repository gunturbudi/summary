# Summary of How humans and AI can work together to create better businesses | Sylvain Duranton

This video discusses how humans and artificial intelligence (AI) can work together to create better businesses. AI fails when it is not coded by data scientists and domain experts together, and it is important to build powerful interfaces between humans and AI to solve the most difficult problems. In one example, a team trained an AI model in a few weeks to outperform human buyers in predicting sales at a competing fashion retailer.

The author shares the paradox that many companies are currently pursuing: becoming less bureaucratic and more autonomous in order to be more agile. However, he warns that this might backfire, as AI operates just like bureaucracies and can easily create new, terrifying forms of bureaucracy called "algocracy." He suggests that human judgment should always be kept in the loop in order to avoid these negative consequences.

Sylvain Duranton argues that businesses should use human-AI collaboration to reduce forecast errors. He provides an example of a retailer that was able to reduce forecast errors by 50% using this method. The video also argues that businesses should invest in human knowledge instead of just data and AI.
