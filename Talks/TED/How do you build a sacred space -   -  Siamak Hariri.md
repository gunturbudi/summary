# Summary of How do you build a sacred space? | Siamak Hariri

Architect Siamak Hariri describes his experience designing a sacred space, the Bahá'í Temple for South America. The temple is meant to be open and welcoming to people of all faiths, with a design that evokes emotions and is alive with light. Hariri faced the challenge of designing a temple with no pattern or models to draw from, but ultimately created a symmetrical, circular building comprised of nine wings with borosilicate glass and Portuguese stone. The Temple of Light, set against the Andes, provides visitors with views of the city below and radiates gardens and paths. The opening ceremony was a sacred event attended by 5,000 people from 80 countries. The temple aims to make all who enter feel welcome.
