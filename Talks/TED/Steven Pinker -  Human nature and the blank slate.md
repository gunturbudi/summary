# Summary of Steven Pinker: Human nature and the blank slate

In "Human Nature and the Blank Slate," Steven Pinker discusses the idea of the blank slate and reasons to doubt it such as the innate structure of the brain, the genetic component to behavior, and children displaying certain temperaments and talents from birth. He also argues that the belief in the blank slate is politically appealing as it implies equality and the possibility of perfecting mankind through social engineering, but suggests that the human mind has the ability to inhibit ignoble motives. Pinker also addresses controversial topics in the behavioral sciences such as the arts and parenting, suggesting that certain movements and studies have abandoned widely appreciated elements and that many parenting studies do not control for heritability. Finally, he suggests that exploring human nature can challenge political belief systems and quotes Anton Chekhov as an argument for exploring taboo topics.

In this section, Steven Pinker discusses the idea of the "blank slate," which refers to the belief that the human mind is a blank slate and that socialization and experience shape all aspects of our behavior. Pinker explains that there are various reasons to doubt this idea, including the fact that children display certain temperaments and talents from birth and that the minds of men and women are not indistinguishable. He also cites evidence from neuroscience and genetics, including studies of identical twins, which suggest that the brain is innately structured and that certain behaviors and thoughts have a strong genetic component.

In this section, Steven Pinker discusses the reasons why the notion of the blank slate has been politically appealing despite scientific data proving it to be untrue. He explains that the idea of the blank slate implies equality and the possibility of perfecting mankind through social engineering, whereas the existence of innate human nature could lead to prejudice, selfishness, and violence. However, Pinker argues that these are non sequiturs and that even if people have ignoble motives, the human mind is a complex system with the ability to inhibit those motives. Pinker also discusses the risks involved in exploring controversial topics in the behavioral sciences, citing examples of researchers who faced slander and physical assault for their findings.

In this section, Pinker discusses two hot topics that have aroused irate responses - the arts and parenting. Despite claims of decline in the arts over the years, Pinker disregards them as by all economic standards today the arts have never been flourishing more than ever before. The demand for art is skyrocketing, only revealing a grain of truth to the complaint that the arts are in decline. The other topic was parenting, which Pinker claims is not as influential as the common belief that how a child is nurtured accounts for everything including their success or failure, the influence of genes and society must also be considered.

In this section, Steven Pinker discusses the supposed decline in the elite arts and criticism, which he suggests coincides with the denial of human nature. He argues that modernism and post-modernism have rejected beauty, pleasure, clarity, insight, and style, with movements in visual art, literature, poetry, architecture, music, and criticism abandoning certain elements widely appreciated through the centuries. Pinker also notes that many parenting studies do not control for heritability, and that until the research is redone using adoptive children, it is impossible to know whether the causal relationships assumed by these studies are valid.

In this section, Pinker explains the results of genetically controlled studies that show that siblings, even if separated at birth, are no less similar than if they had grown up together. This suggests that children are not only shaped by their genes but also by their culture and chance events. The sciences of human nature have the potential to challenge deeply-held political belief systems, and Pinker argues that we should explore them honestly. He quotes Anton Chekhov, who said, "Man will become better when you show him what he is like," as an argument for exploring these taboo topics.
