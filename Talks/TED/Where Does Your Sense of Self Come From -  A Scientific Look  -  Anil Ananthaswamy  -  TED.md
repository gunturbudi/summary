# Summary of Where Does Your Sense of Self Come From? A Scientific Look | Anil Ananthaswamy | TED

The self is a slippery subject, and the sense of ownership of one's body and body parts is not as permanent as it seems. Alzheimer's disease impairs the formation of short-term memory and the growth of narratives, leading to a distorted understanding of oneself.
This neuropsychologist discusses the concepts of phantom limb syndrome and xenomelia, which are conditions in which people feel as if their body parts don't belong to them. He argues that both conditions are manifestations of a wrong-headed construction of the self.
The speaker discusses the idea that our sense of self is not necessarily permanent, and that our stories and emotions are modulated by it. He goes on to say that our sense of self is fragile, and that it can crack. He urges us to be compassionate towards those who are struggling with altered selves.
