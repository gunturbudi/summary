# Summary of Danny Hillis: The Internet could crash. We need a Plan B

Computer scientist Danny Hillis warns about the potential crash of the internet, highlighting incidents where mistakes in protocols have caused significant issues, and states that we need a Plan B in place. Hillis notes that the internet has become vulnerable to mistakes and attacks due to its increasing complexity and the presence of bad actors. He suggests that the focus should be on defending the internet itself, which has been expanded beyond its limits, and proposes a backup system with different building blocks to work independently of the internet. Hillis emphasizes that recognizing the need for a backup system is crucial, and it does not necessarily need the performance of the internet, but certain functions such as emergency services and hospitals should be able to function remotely.

In this section, Danny Hillis talks about the early days of the internet when there was a strong sense of trust and community among the small group of people using it. He highlights how the internet was built on principles of ‘from each according to their ability, to each according to their need’ and how this idea of only taking what you need was a fundamental belief that surrounded everyone. However, today, with more and more bad actors on the internet and the internet being even more complex than ever, the internet has become vulnerable to mistakes and attacks which can cause catastrophic outcomes. Hillis highlights a couple of incidents where mistakes in protocols caused significant issues which subsequently means we need to have a Plan B in place.

In this section, computer scientist Danny Hillis talks about the vulnerabilities of the internet and how it could potentially crash due to not being properly defended. He warns that people are mostly focused on defending the computers on the internet and there is little attention paid to defending the internet itself. Hillis notes that because of the increasing dependence on the internet for daily functions, even modern systems such as rockets and phones use internet protocol. However, this leaves the internet open to cyberattacks that could bring it down, and while the experts have an informed opinion, the internet changes so quickly that nobody knows exactly what is going on.

In this section, Danny Hillis highlights that the internet has been expanded way beyond the limits of how it was meant to operate, and could crash at any moment as we are not prepared for it. He adds that we need a backup system or Plan B made out of different sets of building blocks to work independently of the internet. Danny suggests that it is not a hard problem but people won't decide to do it until they recognize the need for it, and it does not necessarily have to have the performance of the internet, but the police and fire department should be able to call each other even without the internet, and hospitals should order fuel oil remotely.
