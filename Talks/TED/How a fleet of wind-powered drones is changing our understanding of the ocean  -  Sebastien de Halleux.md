# Summary of How a fleet of wind-powered drones is changing our understanding of the ocean | Sebastien de Halleux

Sebastien de Halleux, the co-founder of Ocean Infinity, discusses the use of wind-powered drones equipped with science-grade sensors to collect oceanographic data. These “surface satellites” are crucial in understanding air-sea interactions and global weather patterns. They can survey fishing grounds with acoustics using a sonar, track marine mammal movements, and identify warming in water temperatures. By deploying one ocean drone per 6-by-6-degree square, we can achieve planetary coverage and better insights into the planetary systems affecting humanity.

In this section, the speaker introduces a wind-powered robot designed as an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) that can sail across the globe for months at a time using wind power alone. He highlights the urgent need to better understand our oceans as the ocean data is scarce and expensive as it relies on a small number of ships and buoys. Additionally, satellites can only see through one micron of the surface of the ocean, and their signal needs to be corrected for cloud cover and other factors. The speaker breaks down the importance of understanding the ocean, especially the surface, which acts as the interface through which all energy and gases must flow, making it crucial in understanding air-sea interactions and global weather patterns.

In this section, Sebastien de Halleux, co-founder of Ocean Infinity, discusses the use of wind-powered drones to collect oceanographic data. These “surface satellites” are about 15 feet high, 23 feet long, and 7 feet deep, and are equipped with science-grade sensors that measure oceanographic and atmospheric movements in real-time. Ocean Infinity has conducted missions in the Bering Sea to assess the size of the pollock fish stock, an essential resource for the United States. The drones survey the fishing ground with acoustics using a sonar and are also helpful in tracking the movements of marine mammals, such as the fur seals in the Pribilof Islands.

In this section, Sebastien de Halleux explains how a fleet of wind-powered drones has helped to uncover the mystery of declining seals in the Pribilof Islands. By using acoustic data collected by the drones, they discovered that the seals were expending more energy to swim to a place where they could find more nutritious fish, but it left them without enough energy to lactate their pups back on the island. The drones also identified a significant warming in the water temperature around the island, which may be driving the pollock north in search of colder regions. Depleting the fish stocks affects not only the seals but also humans who depend on oceans for up to 20 kilos of fish per year. By deploying one ocean drone per 6-by-6-degree square, we can achieve planetary coverage and better insights into the planetary systems affecting humanity.
