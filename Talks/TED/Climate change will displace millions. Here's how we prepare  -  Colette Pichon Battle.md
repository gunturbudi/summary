# Summary of Climate change will displace millions. Here's how we prepare | Colette Pichon Battle

Climate change is expected to displace over 180 million people by the end of the century, making it crucial that we prepare for global migration now. Colette Pichon Battle stresses the importance of understanding and mitigating climate gentrification, which displaces vulnerable communities from their homes and can lead to social and economic consequences. To address this, society must restructure its economic and political systems to focus on regeneration and repair of the earth, and reframe its understanding of climate change as a symptom of a larger economic system. Additionally, Pichon Battle emphasizes the need for us to reindigenize ourselves and follow the leadership of each specific place to commit to ecological equity, climate justice, and human rights. She believes that only by collectively transforming into a just, fair society can we survive and thrive.
