# Summary of What makes something go viral? | Dao Nguyen

Dao Nguyen, the Vice President of Growth and Data at BuzzFeed, discusses the science behind viral content in her YouTube video. She explains that shared anticipation and creating a sense of community are instrumental in driving viral content. Nguyen also suggests reframing content categorization based on its job for the audience, rather than traditional metadata such as tags or formats. This process, called "cultural cartography," involves understanding the audience's culture, interests and values, making it easier to create impactful, viral content. Finally, Nguyen emphasizes an understanding of the audience is crucial to creating effective and shareable content.

In this section, Nguyen describes her team's discovery of the power of shared anticipation in driving viral content, using the example of the "goats in the office" livestream, which attracted unexpectedly large viewership. She hypothesizes that people enjoyed being part of a shared community, and her team went on to test this hypothesis by creating another viral video, which involved wrapping rubber bands around a watermelon until it explodes. Nguyen argues that traditional metadata, such as tags or formats, does not get at what really matters. Instead, she suggests categorizing content according to the job it does for the reader or viewer, an approach that she calls "cultural cartography." Nguyen describes the map that BuzzFeed has created to categorize its content, based on such jobs as "makes me laugh," "identity," and "helps me connect with another person."

In this section, Dao Nguyen talks about how media and creators can establish a deeper connection with the audience, which is often achieved by putting themselves in their audience's shoes. She provides examples of how different types of content go viral by targeting a specific job, such as making someone feel something, helping them learn something about themselves, or helping them bond with family or friends. Nguyen highlights the potential of this project to help media companies and advertisers better understand their audience and change the relationship between media and data.
