# Summary of Why is the world warming up? | Kristen Bell + Giant Ant

The video uses the analogy of the Earth as a greenhouse to explain why the world is warming up. The Earth's atmosphere reflects some of the sun's energy, but most of it heats up the planet. The excess carbon dioxide that humans emit thickens the glass of the greenhouse, slowing down the release of heat back into space and contributing to rising temperatures on Earth. This could lead to temperatures too hot for humans and eventually, life on Earth.

In this section, the video explains why the world is warming up, using the analogy of the Earth as a greenhouse. The Earth’s atmosphere reflects some of the sun’s energy but most of it heats up the planet. The excess carbon dioxide humans emit thickens the glass of the greenhouse, which slows down the escape of heat back into space, contributing to rising temperatures on Earth. The video emphasizes that the result will be temperatures too hot for humans and eventually, life.
