# Summary of The Disappearing Computer: An Exclusive Preview of Humaneâ€™s Screenless Tech | Imran Chaudhri | TED

Imran Chaudhri, former Apple designer, previews a new kind of wearable device that integrates with artificial intelligence (AI) and is standalone, screenless, seamless, and sensing, allowing users to access computing power while remaining present in their surroundings. He emphasizes the importance of designing for a future where technology is both ambient and contextual, creating a world where we can be fully engaged without screens. He believes that as AI advances, it will transform every aspect of our lives, re-imagining the human-technology relationship to enhance our ability to navigate the world around us.

In this section, Imran Chaudhri, former Apple designer, explains how technology has evolved from desktop computers to smartphones, smartwatches, and augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) glasses but believes the future lies in wearable devices that integrate with artificial intelligence (AI). Chaudhri introduces a new kind of wearable device, built entirely from the ground up for AI, that is completely standalone, screenless, seamless, and sensing. It interacts with the world the way the user interacts with the world, allowing the user to access the power of compute while remaining present in their surroundings. Chaudhri emphasizes that this device will unlock a world of possibility for us if done right.
