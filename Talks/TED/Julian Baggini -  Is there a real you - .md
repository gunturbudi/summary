# Summary of Julian Baggini: Is there a real you?

Philosopher Julian Baggini challenges the notion that there is a permanent and unchanging core to a person's identity. He argues that a person is simply the sum of their parts, and any changes in their beliefs, memories or even a heart transplant would not change their core identity. Baggini calls this the "ego trick," a mechanical trick which makes us believe that we have an abiding core of self, which neuroscience has shown not to be the case. Instead, we should embrace the idea that we are a process and not a permanent entity, and our true self is not discovered within us but shaped and created as we develop over time, according to Baggini. Embracing this perspective can drive personal growth and is a liberating concept.

In this section, philosopher Julian Baggini challenges the idea that there is a permanent, unchanging core to a person's identity. While common sense suggests that a person is defined by their memories, desires, beliefs, and experiences, Baggini argues that these components are not related to a central "you," but are instead a collection of connected experiences. He proposes that a person is simply the sum of their parts and that even if one were to undergo a heart, memory, or belief transplant, they would remain the same person.

In this section, Julian Baggini argues that the idea that humans are separate entities with an underlying essence or core, different from everything else in the universe, is a fallacy. He highlights that like anything else in the universe, we are an ordered collection of things suitably arranged, which makes us who we are. Baggini refers to this as the "ego trick" and highlights that it is a mechanical trick, making us experience a sense of self that is more unified than is realistically present. He suggests that this view is supported by neuroscience, which has shown that there is no central control spot in the brain where things come together, making it hard to reject the idea of an abiding core of self for each of us. However, Baggini explains that embracing this idea is liberating, and we should think of ourselves as a process rather than a permanent entity.

In this section, Julian Baggini explains his perspective on the concept of the "true self." He argues that our true self is not something that we simply discover within us, but rather, we have the capacity to shape and create it as we develop over time. Baggini emphasizes that, while there are limits to what we can achieve, we should think of ourselves as malleable entities that can be changed and channeled. This idea of creating our true selves is, according to Baggini, a liberating and exciting prospect that can drive our personal growth.
