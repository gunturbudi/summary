In this section, Dan Widmaier explains how the fashion industry is in the midst of a sustainability crisis due to the materials it uses, and why it's difficult to solve this problem with consumption habits alone. However, scientists can create sustainable fashion by changing the materials themselves, and the answers to these problems lie in nature. Widmaier fell in love with spider silk during his PhD and even created a tie out of it. However, the real challenge was replicating the microstructure of leather without using cows. After many failed attempts, he found that the world of fungi offered a potential solution.
