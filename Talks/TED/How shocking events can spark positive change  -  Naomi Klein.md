In this section, Naomi Klein discusses the idea of how some large-scale crises can inspire positive change, whereas other crises fail to do so. She talks about how events like the Great Crash of 1929 led to an awakening and a subsequent leap towards creating safety nets and job-creating public investments. However, given the non-stop shocks of today, like climate change and rising fascism, she questions why they do not lead to significant action. According to Klein, the answer lies in a combination of imagination and organization, which are often left out of history books but are crucial in catalyzing transformation. She explains that revolutionary power lies in the interplay between these two factors.

Klein emphasizes the need for a holistic and universalist vision of a different world than our predecessors had, and suggests breaking down the walls between silos to make the connections between different issues and solutions more visible.

In this section, Naomi Klein talks about the need for a clear and coherent vision of the world we want to live in. She highlights the importance of having a destination to leap towards, rather than just blindly jumping up and down. Klein talks about The Leap Manifesto which was created by a diverse group of people in Canada to agree on a short statement describing the world they want to see after transitioning to a cleaner economy and a fairer society. The Leap platform includes ideas such as a 100% renewable energy economy, free universal daycare, and electoral reform. Klein believes that The Leap Manifesto rejects the idea of hierarchy of crises and provides permission to act less like brands and more like movements. The manifesto has traveled well since its launch in Canada, being written in different countries, and gaining a lot of traction.
