# Summary of Clay Shirky: How the Internet will (one day) transform government

In this video, Clay Shirky discusses the potential for the internet to transform government. He highlights how open-source programming and Git systems have allowed for collaboration and peer-review in projects, which could be applied to lawmaking, budgets, and citizen-developed bills. He acknowledges potential power struggles and the resistance to participation, urging the use of collaborative tools for society at large. He suggests that we currently have the technology to allow citizens to participate in legislative processes and proposes the question of whether or not we should press these tools into service for society.

In this section, the speaker shared stories of the open-source programming world and Martha Payne's food blog to emphasize how the medium changes society by putting a lot of new ideas into circulation that people can either agree or disagree with. He also spoke about how the first scientific journal ever published was created by natural philosophers who needed "openness" and "speed" to synchronize what other scientists knew and improved the way scientists argued with each other. The peer-reviewed system allowed the scientific community to determine truth versus opinion. Similarly, although the Internet has led to more arguing, it has also created a platform for fact-checking, collaboration, and peer review, which means we are closer than ever before to an open-sourced form of government.

In this section, the speaker discusses how open-source programmers have been leading the way in using social media to improve arguments instead of creating more arguments. They tackle the problem of managing large software projects where multiple programmers overwrite each other's work or send competing instructions to the computer by adopting a feudal management system with version control. However, Linus Torvalds, the most famous open-source programmer, challenged this and believed in giving everyone access to all the source code all the time. He created Git, which is a distributed version control system that has two major differences with traditional version control systems. It lives up to the promise of open-source and allows everyone who works on a project to have access to all the source code all of the time, and it brings chaos back by creating a complicated workflow for working together.

In this section of the video, the speaker discusses how the Git system has brought about cooperation without coordination among open-source programmers. The system generates unique signatures that tie to each change, allowing programmers to modify the same file without knowing of each other's existence beforehand. This has led to the formation of enormous and complex communities that are now able to create things together. The speaker suggests that this method can be applied to democracies, particularly lawmaking, as law is another field that relies on resolving many opinions to a single canonical copy. He cites examples of projects hosted on GitHub experimenting with the political ramifications of such a system, indicating the potential for change.

In this section, Shirky discusses the potential for using collaborative tools such as GitHub for citizen-developed bills or budgets. He explains how programmers take for granted the collaboratively edited text visible on GitHub and how no democracy in the world offers this feature to its citizens for legislation or budgets, despite these being done with consent and money of the citizens. Shirky acknowledges the power struggle at hand, the lack of legislative power for individuals experimenting with participation, and the resistance to participation among those who hold legislative power. Shirky highlights that the citizens' expectation that Martha Payne's opinions should not be censored played a significant role in getting her opinions out to the public, along with a piece of technology. He closes by suggesting that we are now at a point in time where we have several collaboration tools that have revealed what they can do. The question now becomes, are we going to let the programmers keep these tools to themselves, or press them into service for society at large?
