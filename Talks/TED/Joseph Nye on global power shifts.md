# Summary of Joseph Nye on global power shifts

Joseph Nye discusses two major shifts in global power: power transition and power diffusion. Power transition refers to the shift of power from West to East, particularly with the recovery and return of Asia as more than half of the world's population and product. On the other hand, power diffusion pertains to the rise of non-state actors due to the significant decrease in computing and communication costs, which now allows everyone to have access to technologies that were previously exclusive to governments and multinational corporations. Nye argues that a new narrative of power that combines hard and soft power is necessary, focusing on producing global public goods while protecting national interests, similar to Hillary Clinton's "smart power."

In this section, Joseph Nye discusses the two major shifts in global power: power transition and power diffusion. Power transition refers to the shift of power from West to East, particularly with the recovery and return of Asia as more than half of the world's population and product. On the other hand, power diffusion pertains to the rise of non-state actors, due to the significant decrease in computing and communication costs, which now allows everyone to have access to technologies that were previously exclusive to governments and multinational corporations. While this shift does not signal the end of the State's prominence, it does mean that a wide range of actors now have the capacity to affect others, making traditional concepts like war and interstate war less relevant.

In this section, Joseph Nye discusses power and the different ways it can be achieved, such as through coercion, payments, or by getting others to want what you want, which he categorizes as soft power. The traditional view of power was primarily in terms of military power, but Nye argues that we need a new narrative to understand power in the 21st century, one that is more focused on narratives and whose narrative is more effective. He also argues that current narratives about the decline of the United States due to the rise of China are over-enthusiastic, stating that such narratives tell us more about psychology than they do about reality. Nye points out that projections about China's economic growth surpassing that of the United States may not be accurate and that we need to be very careful about such projections, as history is not linear, and there are often bumps and accidents along the way.

In this section, Joseph Nye explains that simple projections of power shifts, such as those based solely on economics, are insufficient for understanding power transition. He argues that misreading power shifts can be dangerous and even lead to overreaction, citing fear as the greatest danger in managing the shift towards the East, as well as the rise of China. Nye also illustrates the three-dimensional nature of power, with military power among states on the top board, economic power among states on the middle board, and transnational relations that cross borders outside the control of governments on the bottom board, where power is chaotically distributed. Nye highlights that cooperation and the ability to organize networks are crucial for solving global problems, particularly those that fall under the bottom board of the three-dimensional chess game.

In this section, Joseph Nye argues that the traditional view of power as a zero-sum game, where one country wins at the expense of another, is outdated. Instead, he suggests that countries should look for ways to collaborate and produce global public goods that benefit everyone. Nye acknowledges that hard power, such as military strength, is essential in the 21st century, but smart power, combining hard and soft power, is necessary to address the new kinds of problems we face. He advocates for a new narrative of power that focuses on producing global public goods while also protecting national interests. Hillary Clinton's "smart power," which uses all tools available in foreign policy, serves as an example of this new narrative.
