In this section, the speaker talks about how families are overwhelmed and shares the story of the Starr family who found a solution inspired by the agile development program. Unlike the traditional top-down approach where executives dictate the plan, agile development allows small groups to manage themselves, receive feedback and make changes on a daily basis. With his family, David Starr drew upon this strategy and implemented weekly family meetings that increase communication, decrease stress and increased happiness. The speaker explains that agile development is based on the principles of adaptability, flexibility, and quick decision making which can, in turn, work very well for families who need to be "agile" and quickly adapt to changing circumstances in their own lives.
