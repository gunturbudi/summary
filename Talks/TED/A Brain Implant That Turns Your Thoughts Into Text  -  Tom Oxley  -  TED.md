# Summary of A Brain Implant That Turns Your Thoughts Into Text | Tom Oxley | TED

Tom Oxley discusses the development of a brain implant called Stentrode, which records brain activity to create a brain-computer interface (BCI) that can help people with disabilities communicate through digital devices. Unlike previous brain implants that required invasive surgery, Stentrode can be delivered through blood vessels in the brain, allowing for a more scalable and less risky approach. Oxley also highlights the potential of BCI technology in treating medical conditions such as epilepsy, depression, and dementia, and envisions a future where the full potential of the brain can be unlocked through BCIs.

In this section, the speaker discussed how brain-computer interfaces (BCI) can help people with disabilities who are unable to use their hands or speak. With the help of a BCI, people can now send text messages, emails, and even social media updates just by thinking. While neurosurgeons use to drill needles directly into the brain, which involves open-brain surgery, this is no longer necessary. Since the blood vessels are the natural highways into the brain, there is a way in without invasive surgery, and the speaker is trying to explore this method. BCIs have the power to revolutionize the way we communicate and can significantly improve the lives of those with disabilities.

In this section, Tom Oxley explains how his team has managed to develop an implant called a Stentrode which can be left inside the blood vessels of the brain. The Stentrode is a sensor that can record brain activity, which is connected to a cable to bring the information out of the brain, and can be delivered in the cath lab. This technology can be used to create a brain-computer interface (BCI), which can restore control to the outside world. The Stentrode is always ready to go and uses specific movements to build blocks for control on digital devices.

In this section, the speaker discusses how creating a dictionary of brain signals across all humans can make brain-computer interfaces (BCI) scalable. He describes how BCI technology has already enabled people with paralysis to regain some autonomy and independence. The speaker then goes on to discuss the exciting possibilities that BCI could bring to other medical conditions such as epilepsy, depression, and dementia. He concludes by pondering the future of communication and how the full potential of the brain could be unlocked through BCI technology.
