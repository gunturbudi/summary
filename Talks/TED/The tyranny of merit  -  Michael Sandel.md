# Summary of The tyranny of merit | Michael Sandel

Michael Sandel argues that the meritocratic ideal, which suggests that everyone has an equal chance to succeed and those who succeed deserve it, is flawed and has a dark side. It leads to a divide between the winners and losers, which breeds political polarization. To solve the issue, he suggests rethinking the role of universities as arbiters of opportunity and focusing on making life better for everyone. Additionally, Sandel believes that the pandemic has highlighted the importance of workers who are often overlooked and suggests a public debate about how to better align their recognition and pay with the importance of their work. He also urges for the renewal of the dignity of work and its placement at the center of politics.

In this section, Michael Sandel discusses how the meritocratic ideal is flawed and how it has a dark side. The ideal is that everyone has an equal chance, and those who succeed deserve their winnings. However, not everyone has an equal opportunity to rise, and the rich often pass on their advantages to their children. Meritocracy is corrosive to the common good, as it leads to hubris among the winners and humiliation among the losers. This creates a divide between winners and losers, which leads to political polarization. To solve this issue, we should rethink the role of universities as arbiters of opportunity and focus less on arming people for meritocratic combat, and more on making life better for everyone.

In this section, Michael Sandel argues for the renewal of the dignity of work and its placement at the center of politics. He laments the fact that people often assume the money others make is the measure of their contribution to the common good. He suggests that we need to appreciate the role of luck in life, which can prompt a certain humility and civic virtue. Sandel believes that the pandemic has shown how deeply we rely on workers who are often overlooked, and it is time for a public debate about how to bring their pay and recognition into better alignment with the importance of their work.
