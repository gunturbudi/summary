# Summary of New thinking on the climate crisis | Al Gore

In his talk, "New thinking on the climate crisis," Al Gore emphasizes the urgent need to address the climate crisis through global mobilization for renewable energy, conservation, efficiency, and a low-carbon economy. He discusses the impact of climate change on the North Polar ice cap, and the lack of urgency surrounding the crisis, calling for a carbon tax and investment in renewable energy rather than sub-prime carbon assets. Gore urges us to approach the climate crisis with joy and gratitude, and stresses the importance of changing global treaties and laws to address the crisis. Lastly, he quotes a proverb emphasizing the need to work together to achieve far-reaching goals.

In this section, Al Gore discusses the importance of behavior and citizenship in addressing the climate crisis. He notes that optimism should not just be a belief or intellectual posture, but rather should bring about new behavior. While changing individual behavior, such as using renewable energy sources, is important, it is more important to change the laws and address the democracy crisis. Gore argues that solving the climate crisis requires a global mobilization for renewable energy, conservation, efficiency, and a low-carbon economy.

In this section, Al Gore highlights the significant impact of climate change on the North Polar ice cap, which has drastically decreased in size in the last 28 years. He explains that this not only affects the Arctic but also puts pressure on Greenland, which could soon be completely melted away. Gore goes on to compare Earth and Venus, emphasizing that Earth has leeched most of its carbon out into the ground, whereas most of the carbon on Venus is still in its atmosphere, causing its temperature to reach a scorching 855 degrees. He then discusses the evidence for man-made global warming pollution, citing the scientific consensus that it is responsible for trapping more outgoing infrared and heating up the planet. Though there has been progress in public awareness of climate change, there is still a lack of urgency in confronting this global challenge.

In this section, Al Gore discusses the lack of urgency surrounding the climate crisis and laments the media's apparent disinterest in discussing it. He comments on the accelerated pace of developing countries' greenhouse gas emissions and how they are contributing to the problem. He also proposes a solution to the crisis: put a price on carbon through a CO2 tax that would be revenue-neutral and replace taxation on employment. Gore states that integrating responses to poverty with climate solutions can make a huge difference in poor countries, noting a proposal for a "supergrid" linked to renewable energy plants in developing countries to supply Europe's electrical power.

In this section, Al Gore talks about how investing in tar sands and shale oil represents a portfolio of sub-prime carbon assets based on an old model. He suggests investing in geothermal, concentrating solar, advanced photovoltaics, efficiency, and conservation. Australia, which was the only country that did not ratify the Kyoto agreement, has now changed its position on it, given the horrible drought they experienced, and the new Prime Minister's campaign to lift the sense of urgency for the people. Al Gore urges for a heroic generational mission that sets aside distractions and rises to the historical challenge presented by the climate crisis. He concludes by expressing optimism that humanity has the capacity to solve this problem, given moments of great challenge.

In this section, Al Gore reframes our perception of the climate crisis from being a burden to being a challenge worthy of our best efforts. He encourages us to approach this crisis with joy and gratitude, knowing that we have a rare opportunity that only a few generations in human history have had. Al Gore also discusses the election campaign dialogue on the climate crisis, stating that while the candidates are saying the right things, their dialogue lacks the bold initiative needed to address the crisis. Changing the pattern of CO2 emissions requires a scope, scale, and speed of change beyond what we have achieved in the past. Therefore, Gore urges us to be optimistic and active citizens in the fight against climate change.

In this section, Al Gore stresses the importance of changing not only personal habits but also laws and global treaties to address the climate crisis. He calls for an active democracy and a higher level of consciousness, stating that it will take a collective effort to enact change. Gore also discusses the Alliance for Climate Protection's upcoming campaign, which will mobilize people from various backgrounds to address climate change. Lastly, he quotes a proverb that emphasizes the need to work together in order to achieve far-reaching goals.
