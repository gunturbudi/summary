# Summary of Rob Knight: How our microbes make us who we are

This video discusses the importance of the human microbiome in health and disease. It explains how different microbes can affect our health, and how we can use data from the Human Microbiome Project to develop new therapies.

Detail Summary:

The human body is host to trillions of microbes, many of which are critical to our health and well-being. The Human Microbiome Project has mapped out the microbes in different parts of the body, revealing that different regions of the body have different microbes. This information is helpful in understanding how different people are and in developing new medical treatments.

Rob Knight discusses how our gut microbes play an important role in our health, and how they are affected by our birth mode and lifestyle. He shows how one baby's stool changes over time and how this correlates with their antibiotic use.

The video discusses the importance of the gut microbiota in human health and how it can be affected by environmental factors, such as exposure to antibiotics. It also explores the importance of studying the gut microbiota in mice and how it can be used to develop therapies for diseases such as obesity and malnutrition.

Rob Knight, a scientist at the BioFrontiers Institute, discusses the use of robots and lasers to study the human microbiome. He explains that microbes are important for both our health and for curing diseases. He shows how, after transplanting healthy microbes into patients with C. diff, the patients' symptoms immediately improve. Knight says that we need to develop a microbial GPS in order to better understand and treat diseases. He urges the audience to try out some of the microbiome-related kits available at the BioFrontiers Institute.
