# Summary of Capitalism will eat democracy -- unless we speak up | Yanis Varoufakis

Yanis Varoufakis argues that democracy is often taken for granted in the West, and that capitalism does not inevitably bring democracy. He believes that democracy is needed to solve problems, develop human talents, and finance green technologies. He advocates for reuniting the political and economic spheres through democratization in order to avoid a surveillance-mad hyperautocracy. Varoufakis suggests the implementation of a capital market and a green fund financed by a universal, global currency called "the cosmos" to achieve a Star Trek-like utopia. He also discusses the missed opportunity to reboot the Eurozone architecture and emphasizes the catastrophic consequences of its failure.

In this section, Yanis Varoufakis highlights the mistake that people in the West make in terms of taking democracy for granted. He notes that democracy is naively seen as part of society's furniture and that capitalism inevitably brings democracy, which has been proven wrong by leaders like Lee Kuan Yew, Beijing and even the Eurogroup. Varoufakis believes that democracy is needed because our societies will be nastier, our future bleak and our great new technologies wasted without it. He explains the twin peaks paradox; a mountain of debt and a mountain of idle cash. The result of this is stagnant wages, and low aggregate demand. Varoufakis suggests that democracy may be the answer to problem-solving in our societies, developing human talents, and financing green technologies.

In this section, Yanis Varoufakis argues that ancient Athenian democracy's significance lay in the inclusion of the working poor who acquired free speech and the right to political judgments in decision-making while modern liberal democracies didn't focus on masters and gave superiority to the Magna Carta tradition. However, liberal democracy only emerged when politics and the economy were separated, which led to an epic struggle between them, giving rise to the colonization of the political by the economic sphere, bringing corporate power to the fore, and cannibalizing political power, causing economic instability. Varoufakis advocates for reuniting the political and economic spheres but democratizing them, so people's autonomy remains intact. If not, he warns, we may end up with a surveillance-mad hyperautocracy, making The Matrix look like a documentary.

In this section, Yanis Varoufakis poses the question of whether capitalism will be succeeded by a Star Trek-like utopia or a Matrix-like dystopia as technology creates new innovations. To achieve the former, Varoufakis suggests the implementation of a capital market where people earn capital as they work and it follows them from one job to another, and a green fund that invests in eco-friendly technologies based on a universal, global currency named “the cosmos”. Such a world is simultaneously libertarian, Marxist, and Keynesian, but ultimately requires a political choice to be made democratically.

In this section, Yanis Varoufakis discusses the hypocrisy in Western democracies, highlighting how democracy has only been confined to the political sphere while the economic sphere remains democracy-free, which is similar to China in the 19th century. He also laments the missed opportunity to reboot the Eurozone architecture and move away from complacency and denial that is threatening its future. Despite the aggression he faced as the former Finance Minister of Greece, Varoufakis remains pro-European and emphasizes the catastrophic consequences of the Eurozone not surviving, both for Europe and the global economy.
