# Summary of The search for dark matter -- and what we've found so far | Risa Wechsler

Dark matter is a substance that humans cannot see but makes up most of the material in the universe. Physicists believe it is made up of a particle that behaves differently than known subatomic particles and passes through normal matter without emitting or absorbing light. Scientists are searching for dark matter through various means, such as experiments at the Large Hadron Collider and observing small galaxies. Despite its mystery, researchers are excited about the possibilities for discovery and the potential to gain a deeper understanding of physics and our place in the universe.

In this section, the speaker explains that most of the material in the universe is made of something entirely different than ordinary matter, and it's known as "dark matter." Although humans cannot see it, we know it's there because of its influence on what we can see. Dark matter particles are probably going through our body right now, and in order to understand how we came to be, we first need to understand how our galaxy came to be. The speaker explains that they make model universes in a computer to test different possibilities, which has allowed us to learn a lot about the universe so far.

In this section, the speaker discusses how dark matter is essential for the formation of the galaxy and its constituents, including stars like the Sun. She goes on to explain that most physicists believe that dark matter is made up of a particle similar to known subatomic particles but behaves differently, as it neither emits nor absorbs light and passes through normal matter. Scientists are searching for it using sensitive detectors in deep underground mines and observing the skies with gamma-ray telescopes to detect the high-energy light that is created. Despite several educated guesses, physicists still don't know what dark matter is, and its discovery could unlock many mysteries about the universe.

In this section, the speaker discusses different ways in which scientists can try to learn more about dark matter. One way is through experiments like those conducted at the Large Hadron Collider, which have so far shown us what dark matter is not. Another way is through studying galaxies and making maps of the universe with galaxies. By observing small galaxies that are difficult to find, scientists have detected 60 tiny galaxies orbiting the Milky Way. The existence of these galaxies provides a clue about dark matter as it suggests that it cannot be moving very fast and not much can happen when it runs into normal matter. Despite still being a mystery, it's an exciting time to be studying dark matter.

In this section, the speaker admits that they are unsure if dark matter will ultimately be found and identified, but emphasizes that the search itself will be an exciting and informative process. With numerous possibilities for discovery and increased knowledge of what dark matter is and is not, the quest will likely lead to a deeper understanding of physics and our place in the universe, regardless of whether the elusive particle is ever found.
