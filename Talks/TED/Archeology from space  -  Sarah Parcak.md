# Summary of Archeology from space | Sarah Parcak

Archaeologist Sarah Parcak explains how satellite imagery helped her locate the ancient Egyptian city of Itjtawy, the capital of Egypt for over 400 years during the Middle Kingdom period. To find the buried city, NASA topography data was used to map subtle changes in the landscape, and coring work was done with Egyptian scientists. Evidence of an elite jeweler's workshop was discovered, emphasizing the importance of the city, and Parcak has funding to train young Egyptians in satellite technology for more discoveries. She highlights the power of satellite imagery in finding hidden historical structures and connecting with our past.

In this section, Sarah Parcak, an archaeologist, explains how satellite imagery has helped her to locate an ancient Egyptian city called Itjtawy in the Faiyum of Egypt that was missing for thousands of years. The site was the capital of ancient Egypt for over 400 years during the Middle Kingdom period, about four thousand years ago. Parcak states that to find a buried city in a vast landscape, NASA topography data was used to map out subtle changes in the landscape, and the coring work was done with Egyptian scientists to identify where the city is located. They found a dense layer of pottery and evidence of an elite jeweler's workshop, showing the important status of the city. Parcak also has funding to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can make great discoveries.
