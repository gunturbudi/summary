# Summary of How urban agriculture is transforming Detroit | Devita Davison

Devita Davison discusses how urban agriculture is transforming Detroit, a city with a scarcity of fresh food retail resulting in high rates of obesity and overweight populations. Through over 1,500 gardens and farms, urban agriculture provides access to healthy, fresh food and spaces for social cohesion in low-income communities and people of color. Davison takes the audience through examples like Oakland Avenue Farms and Brightmoor, two projects that combine sustainable ecologies and new market practices. Non-profits like Keep Growing Detroit and FoodLab Detroit help small farmers sell their produce and provide workshops to build and scale healthy food businesses. Ultimately, Devita believes that urban agriculture can kickstart economic opportunities in vulnerable neighborhoods by providing healthy, accessible, delicious, and culturally appropriate food.

In this section, Devita Davison discusses how urban agriculture is transforming Detroit. Due to disinvestment and capital flight, Detroit has a scarcity of fresh food retail resulting in over 70% of Detroiters being obese and overweight. However, Detroit now has open land, fertile soil, proximity to water, willing labor, and a demand for fresh food. As a result, the city has over 1,500 gardens and farms that grow healthy, fresh food and provide spaces for social cohesion in low-income communities and people of color. Davison takes the audience through Oakland Avenue Farms, a five-acre landscape in Detroitâ€™s North End neighborhood that combines sustainable ecologies and new market practices.

In this section, Devita Davison discusses how urban agriculture has transformed the city of Detroit. One example is hosting farm-to-table dinners where people meet and talk with growers, and they're served a meal made from produce grown directly on the farm. Brightmoor, a lower-income community in Detroit, transformed a block into a farmway with parks, gardens, greenhouses, and a community kitchen, cafe and storefront for food artisans and farmers. Keep Growing Detroit, a non-profit, helps small farmers sell their produce through a cooperative called Grown in Detroit, and FoodLab Detroit provides small enterprises with workshops, technical assistance, and industry experts to build and scale healthy food businesses.

In this section, Devita Davison acknowledges that urban agriculture cannot solve all of the problems in Detroit, but it has led to a different way of thinking about the city. Through small, neighborhood-based stories, urban agriculture has helped create a new society left vacant by disintegration from the old, demonstrating how devastation, despair, and decay can be overcome. Despite the challenges of transforming a big city like Detroit to one that is prosperous and inclusive, Devita believes that strengthening the social fabric of communities and kickstarting economic opportunities in vulnerable neighborhoods can start with healthy, accessible, delicious, and culturally appropriate food.
