The speaker suggests three ways to improve the system: economic zones, preference matching between states and refugees, and humanitarian visas. These ideas would give refugees more choice and opportunity, and help to save lives.

The system was created to deal with situations like the one in Syria, but is not being used properly due to a lack of resources and a lack of commitment from the countries involved. The video discusses how the system works from the perspective of a refugee and describes the options available to them.

The author discusses three ideas for improving the refugee system: economic zones, preference matching between states and refugees, and humanitarian visas. He argues that all of these ideas can be successful if implemented carefully and with input from refugees themselves.

The speaker discusses the problems with Europe's refugee system, and suggests ways to fix it. One way would be to allow refugees to travel directly to Europe and seek asylum there, which would save lives and undercut the market for smugglers. The speaker also refers to a historical precedent of allowing refugees to enter other European countries and claim refugee status. This would be a more rational and realistic way to manage migration, instead of relying on outdated humanitarian assistance and charity models. Politicians need to wake up and adopt these ideas, in order to provide more choice and opportunity for refugees.
