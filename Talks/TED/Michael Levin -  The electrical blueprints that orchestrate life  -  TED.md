# Summary of Michael Levin: The electrical blueprints that orchestrate life | TED

Michael Levin discusses the role of bioelectricity in the development of organisms, with cells using electrical signals to communicate with one another to guide the construction of anatomy. By eavesdropping on these signals, Levin was able to create electrical software that determines an organism's fate, offering researchers the opportunity to rewrite living systems' goals. In experiments with flatworms, they found that manipulating the organism's electrical gradient could regenerate multiple heads. Levin also discusses using skin cells to form a new body without a nervous system or brain, improving regenerative medicine, and how this research into bioelectric patterns could lead to AI applications that mimic cells.

In this section of the video, Michael Levin explains that rather than DNA being the sole determinant of an organism's development, bioelectricity plays a crucial role in orchestrating the process. Levin and his team were able to eavesdrop on the electrical signals that cells use to communicate with each other, creating a sort of electrical software that determines the organism's fate. This discovery gives researchers opportunities to target or rewrite the goals toward which these living systems operate.

In this section, Michael Levin explains that biological lifeforms operate through a complex system of electrical circuits, which act as a language to guide the development of large-scale anatomy. Levin compares the traditional methods of life science research with machines programmed through hardware, stressing that electrical signals can be understood as software guiding the construction of organisms. This has potential as an alternative to rewiring specific cellular pathways. In an experiment conducted on flatworms, Levin and researchers discovered that two or more new complete heads could be created by manipulating the organism's electrical gradient rather than applying electricity. The creatures continued to regenerate two or more heads even after the excess tissue was amputated, due to the pattern memory etched in their electrical circuits.

In this section, Michael Levin discusses how the information structure that tells worms how many heads they're supposed to have is not directly in the genome but in an additional bioelectric layer. He explains that by manipulating the electrical transistors inside cells, they can impose a state on cells to build a complete eye and tadpole limbs. Levin refers to this as cracking the bioelectric code, which may eventually provide a way to defeat aging and traumatic injury. He also mentions the creation of a new, novel life-form called a xenobot, which is made up of genetically unaltered cells that have been asked to re-envision their multicellularity. These tiny bodies can move and run a maze, completely separate from frogs or tadpoles.

In this section, Michael Levin discusses his work on using skin cells to form a new body with locomotion, without the use of a nervous system or brain. The plasticity of cells shown here is remarkable, with the cells adapting to form a new body and explore its environment. The cells have spontaneous behaviors, and Levin believes this is a remarkable model for understanding how cells communicate and evolving them to improve regenerative medicine. Furthermore, Levin believes that this research on the bioelectric patterns of cells could lead to new applications in machine learning that mimic the artificial intelligence of body cells.
