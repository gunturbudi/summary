# Summary of Jonathan Eisen: Meet your microbes

Jonathan Eisen discusses the importance of DNA sequencing for studying the microbes that live in and on humans. He explains that this microbial diversity may be responsible for some health and illness differences between people. Eisen suggests probiotics and fecal transplants as ways to restore balance in the human microbiome.

Jonathan Eisen, a microbiologist, discusses the importance of DNA sequencing to studying the microbes that live on and in humans. DNA sequencing can identify the different microbes present on a person, and Eisen explains that this microbial diversity may be responsible for some health and illness differences between people.

Jonathan Eisen discusses the benefits of fecal transplants, or delivering microbes from a healthy donor through the other end of the digestive tract, for treating certain infectious diseases. DNA sequencing technologies are allowing researchers to study the microbes living in and on people more closely, and identify which microbes might be responsible for certain illnesses.
