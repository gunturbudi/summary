In this section, the speaker discusses the power of language and how it is used to alter the settings in someone else's brain to suit the speaker's interests. The subversive power of language has been recognized throughout history in censorship and the Tower of Babel story serves as a fable and warning about the power of language. The speaker explains how social learning is the key to our unique ability to improve on others' ideas and learn from others' mistakes. The lack of social learning in chimpanzees and other hominid species is evidenced by their repetitive tool use over thousands of years. This leads the speaker to question how and why language evolved only in humans and what makes our species unique.

In this section, Mark Pagel explains that social learning, or the ability to learn by watching and imitating others, is what sets humans apart from other animals. Through social learning, humans have been able to accumulate knowledge and ideas, leading to the development of technology and advancements in society. However, this ability to learn from others also created a dilemma: visual theft. In order to solve this dilemma, humans had to choose between retreating into small family groups or developing systems of communication. Choosing the latter option led to the development of language, which is a piece of social technology that enhances the benefits of cooperation. Language allowed humans to share knowledge and coordinate activities, leading to the vast accumulation of knowledge and wisdom that we take for granted today.

In this section, the speaker explains how language has helped people to cooperate and prosper in ways other animals cannot. He gives an example of how difficult trading would be without language and why people might fight over misunderstandings. Humans with language can put their ideas together and cooperate, which has helped our species to dominate the planet. However, it is ironic that we have developed thousands of different languages, and the greatest density of different languages is found where people are most tightly packed together. This suggests that while language can help cooperate, it is also used to draw rings around cooperative groups and to establish identities and protect knowledge and skills from eavesdropping from outside. Different languages can slow the flow of ideas, technologies, and genes between groups.

In this section, Mark Pagel discusses how the phenomenon of globalization creates a dilemma concerning language, as different languages create a barrier to the exchange of goods, ideas, technology, and wisdom. The European Union, for example, spends over one billion euros yearly on translating among the 23 official languages of its 27 member countries. In a world seeking more cooperation and exchange, it raises the possibility that it might be inevitable that our destiny is to be one world with one language. Pagel also tackles the idea that genes alone cannot determine the outcome of complex things like language.
