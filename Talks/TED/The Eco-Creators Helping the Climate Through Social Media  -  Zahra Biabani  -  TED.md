In this section, the speaker, Zahra Biabani talks about her experience as part of EcoTok, a collective of 19 people that uses social media to share climate education, memes, infographics, and TikToks with their four-million-strong audience. Most of EcoTok's followers are millennials and Gen Z. Biabani stresses the impact of the weight of doom and gloom and bad news, amplified by social media, and the tendency of individuals, including herself, to believe in change through passive sharing of awareness posts instead of active participation. To counter this, EcoTok's approach shares positive news stories, week after week, to inspire hope and turn anxiety into action. Through their work, Biabani found that institutional divestment from fossil fuels, the return of land to indigenous communities, and the implementation of renewable energy standards were examples of positive news stories worth sharing.
