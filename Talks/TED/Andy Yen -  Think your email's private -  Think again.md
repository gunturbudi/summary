In this section, we are reminded that in today's society, our personal information is online and adds up every time we send an email, post on Facebook or Google. Our data lasts forever, so our data will outlive us, and we have largely lost control of our privacy. This piece delves into the most basic solution which is to use encryption on emails. This section goes on to explore why this encryption process hadn't already been implemented, which was largely due to the internet's business model, and advertising is a massive player in this.

In this section, the speaker discusses the need for accessibility to privacy technology and how his project, ProtonMail, offers a simple solution to email privacy. ProtonMail uses an encryption process that generates keys on the user's computer rather than storing them on a server, allowing for the transmission of encrypted messages that cannot be read by the server. This encryption process is done in the background, hidden from the user, making it accessible to everyone without the need for technical knowledge. The speaker concludes that accessibility to privacy can be achieved when individuals prioritize data protection over ad revenue and unite with others towards a common goal.

Yen emphasizes that each and every one of us is responsible for protecting our privacy as it is an essential component of a free society, and encourages everyone to work together towards making online privacy a reality.
