# Summary of A smart new business loan for people with no credit | Shivani Siroya

Tala, founded by Shivani Siroya, is a mobile application in emerging markets that enables people with no formal credit history to build credit scores through alternative data points, such as communication and travel habits, and social networks. The credit scores allow people like Jenipher, a Kenyan small-business owner, to access loans to improve their financial stability and invest in their businesses. Siroya shares that Tala has delivered over 200,000 loans with repayment rates above 90%, demonstrating that people in emerging markets can repay loans when given the opportunity. Jenipher, aided by Tala's credit score, has even applied for a small-business loan from a commercial bank.

In this section, we learn about how traditional financial institutions rely on credit scores to determine who they can trust with loans and other financial products. However, 2.5 billion people around the world do not have a credit score due to a lack of formal public records. To address this issue, Shivani Siroya created a mobile application that builds credit scores using mobile data, such as a person's smartphone usage. Through this app, people like Jenipher, a small-business owner in Nairobi, Kenya, can access loans to improve their financial security and invest in their businesses. Jenipher was able to apply for a loan through the app and by allowing the app access to her phone data, she was able to prove her creditworthiness despite not having a traditional credit score.

By analyzing data such as communication patterns, travel habits, and social networks, Tala can determine if someone is likely to repay their loan, even if they have no formal credit history or income. Siroya shares the story of Jenipher, a Kenyan borrower who was able to increase her savings and start multiple businesses thanks to a loan from Tala. With these new opportunities, Jenipher is now applying for a small-business loan from a traditional commercial bank.
