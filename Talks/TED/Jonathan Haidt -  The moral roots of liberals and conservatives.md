# Summary of Jonathan Haidt: The moral roots of liberals and conservatives

In this YouTube video, Jonathan Haidt discusses the moral roots of liberals and conservatives. He explains that people's personality trait called "openness to experience" plays a significant role in shaping political views and group participation. Haidt emphasizes the five foundations of morality: harm/care, fairness/reciprocity, in-group/loyalty, authority/respect, and purity/sanctity, with liberals having a two-channel morality centered around harm and fairness, while conservatives have a five-channel morality that includes in-group, authority, and purity. He also argues that the balance between change and stability offered by liberals and conservatives is necessary for a functioning society, and encourages listeners to understand other people's points of view to cultivate moral humility.

In this section, Jonathan Haidt discusses the personality trait called "openness to experience" and how it influences political views and group participation. He explains that people high in openness to experience crave novelty, variety, and new ideas, while those low on the trait prefer things that are familiar and safe. He also cites research that shows open individuals tend to have liberal, left-wing political views, while closed individuals tend to have conservative, right-wing views. The lack of moral diversity in groups can lead to the psychology of teams, which can shut down open-minded thinking. Haidt urges people to step outside of their moral matrices and study moral psychology to gain a deeper understanding of the world.

In this section, Jonathan Haidt discusses the five foundations of morality that can be found in almost every culture and species: harm/care, fairness/reciprocity, in-group/loyalty, authority/respect, and purity/sanctity. Haidt explains how these foundations are like the five settings on an audio equalizer that can be set to different levels for different people. Liberals have a two-channel morality centered around harm and fairness, while conservatives have a five-channel morality that includes in-group, authority, and purity. This difference can be seen in the varying scores on a questionnaire taken by people across political spectrums and in different countries.

In this section of the video, Jonathan Haidt discusses the three moral foundations that are commonly supported by conservatives: loyalty, authority, and sanctity. He argues that these foundations are necessary for creating cooperative groups and communities, and that they are key to understanding the origin of religion. On the other hand, liberals tend to reject these foundations in favor of individual rights and celebrating diversity. While Haidt acknowledges the noble motivations behind liberal ideology, he emphasizes the importance of order and institutions in achieving a functioning society.

In this section, Jonathan Haidt suggests that liberals and conservatives offer a balance between change and stability, like yin and yang in Asian religions. He goes on to explain that our moral psychology was designed by evolution to unite us into teams, divide us against other teams, and blind us to the truth so that the struggle between "for" and "against" becomes the mind's worst disease. Haidt encourages listeners to step out of the moral matrix, even if just for a moment, to cultivate moral humility and to understand other people's points of view. Doing so, he argues, will help us to use our passionate commitment to the truth for a better future for all rather than to force our ideas on others.
