# Summary of How I held my breath for 17 minutes | David Blaine

In this TED talk, David Blaine recounts his tale of ambition to hold his breath for as long as possible. Initially seeking methods like liquid breathing, high-oxygen chemicals, and heart/lung bypass machines, he ultimately turned to free-diving to learn static apnea, techniques of not moving, slowing his heart rate down, and purging CO2 from his body. Blaine trained for months, losing 50 pounds and eating a healthy diet to adapt his body, bringing down his resting heart rate and increasing his breath-holding time to over seven minutes, before attempting to break the world record on live television. His first attempt and the one adding handcuffs for entertainment purposes failed, but with the help of Oprah, he trained longer and broke the world record by holding his breath for 17 minutes and four seconds. Blaine concludes by thanking the audience and stating that magic is not about manipulation but rather about creating a profound connection with people and pushing personal limits.

In this section, David Blaine, a magician, reveals how he challenged himself to do things that doctors said were not possible. He narrates some of his previous stunts like being buried alive, frozen in a block of ice for three days, and living in a glass box for 44 days. Blaine then tells the story of how he pursued holding his breath for as long as he possibly could. He started by creating a water tank but realized it wouldn't work out. Then, a doctor suggested he create the illusion of not breathing, making it easier to hold his breath for several minutes. However, he later considered the possibility of liquid breathing â€“ a method of breathing that involves the use of a breathable liquid to supply oxygen to the lungs.

In this section, David Blaine discusses the different ideas he had in his quest to hold his breath for an extended period of time, including experiments with high-oxygen chemicals, heart/lung bypass machines, and pearl divers. He ultimately discovered the world of free-diving, where he studied static apnea and learned techniques such as never moving, slowing his heart rate down, and purging to rid his body of CO2. Blaine trained for months, losing 50 pounds and eating only nutritious foods to adapt his body, bring down his resting heart rate to 38 beats per minute, and increase his breath-holding time to over seven minutes. He then attempted to break the world record live on TV.

In this section, David Blaine shares the story of his first failed attempt to beat the world record for breath-holding on live television. He had to add handcuffs for entertainment purposes to the challenge, but it proved to be a critical mistake as it hampered his performance and led to a failed attempt, causing him to start to black out. However, his determination pushed him to seek the help of Oprah to train longer and make another attempt. With a successful attempt of 15 minutes, he publicly announced his intention to break Sietas' record but unfortunately failed, as the record was pushed up by 3 minutes more than he anticipated.

In this section, David Blaine describes the difficulties he faced while holding his breath for 17 minutes. There was a heart rate monitor that made him more nervous as he heard the ticking every time his heart would beat. Even though he normally started at 38 beats per minute when holding his breath, this time it started at 120 beats and never went down. He spent the first five minutes trying to slow his heart rate while nervously thinking that he was going to fail. At the halfway mark, he was 100% certain that he was not going to be able to make it but he pushed himself through the pain and went on to break the world record by holding his breath for 17 minutes and four seconds.

In this section, David Blaine concludes his TED Talk on the power of magic by thanking the audience for his chance to share his own experiences with them. He emphasizes that magic is not about manipulation, but rather about creating a profound connection with others and pushing personal limits. He closes with an expression of gratitude for his ability to share his passion with others, and leaves the stage to a round of applause.
