# Summary of The neurons that shaped civilization | VS Ramachandran

VS Ramachandran discusses the role of mirror neurons in human civilization, suggesting that their sudden emergence allowed early humans to imitate and emulate the actions of others, leading to the rapid spread of skills and the emergence of culture. He also explains how mirror neurons for touch allow empathy towards others being touched, but feedback from our skin receptors prevents us from confusing our own experiences with those of others. This feedback creates the notion of an independent self, but when a patient with a phantom limb watches someone else being touched, they feel it in their phantom limb, undermining the notion of an independent self and laying the groundwork for Eastern philosophy. The discovery of the mirror neuron system highlights the importance of the interface between science and psychology in understanding issues such as consciousness, representation of self, and civilization's emergence.

In this section, VS Ramachandran talks about the importance of mirror neurons in the human brain and how they may have played a role in the emergence of human culture and the rapid spread of skills such as tool use, fire making, and language. He suggests that the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system allowed early humans to emulate and imitate the actions of others, making evolutionary progress much more Lamarckian than Darwinian. Ramachandran also touches on mirror neurons for touch and how they allow empathy towards others being touched.

In this section, Ramachandran explains that our ability to empathize with others stems from mirror neurons in our brains that are activated when we witness others being touched. However, we do not actually feel the touch because feedback from our skin receptors prevents us from confusing our own sensory experiences with those of others. This feedback creates the notion of an independent self, but when a patient with a phantom limb watches someone else being touched, they feel it in their phantom limb. This connectivity undermines the notion of an independent self and is the basis for much of Eastern philosophy. The discovery of the mirror neuron system also shows that the interface between science and psychology is critical to understanding issues such as consciousness, representation of self, and the emergence of civilization.
