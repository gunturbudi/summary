# Summary of Does money make you mean? | Paul Piff

Paul Piff discusses the effects of wealth on empathy and pro-social behavior in society. His studies have shown that as individuals become wealthier, their entitlement, self-interest, and unethical behavior increases while their empathy and pro-social behavior decreases. Economic inequality leads to negative outcomes such as obesity and violence, and decreases physical health, social trust, and mobility. However, Piff mentions that small interventions can help restore empathy and egalitarianism, and highlights grassroots movements such as "We are the 1 percent" and "Wealth for Common Good" as a way for wealthy individuals to advocate for policies that reduce inequality and restore the American dream.

In this section, the speaker discusses the results of a study conducted at UC Berkeley in which rich and poor players were randomly assigned and played a rigged game of Monopoly over 15 minutes. Rich players were given more money, better opportunities to move around the board, and the chance to roll two dice instead of one. As the game went on, rich players became louder, ruder, and more demonstrative of their material success, showcasing how well they were doing. At the end of 15 minutes, rich players talked about what they'd done to earn their success in the game, becoming far less attuned to the randomness that had put them in their privileged position in the first place. This study provides valuable insight into how the mind makes sense of advantage and can be used as a metaphor for understanding society's hierarchical structure.

In this section, Paul Piff talks about the effects of hierarchies on people's levels of wealth and status. His studies over the past seven years have found that individuals' empathy decreases as their wealth increases, and their entitlement and ideology of self-interest increases. In fact, surveys have found that wealthier individuals are more likely to view the pursuit of self-interest as favorable and moral. Piff's studies on pro-social behavior have found that poorer individuals are more likely to give to strangers than those who are wealthier, and that wealthier individuals are more likely to cheat, lie, and endorse unethical behavior.

In this section, Paul Piff discusses the relationship between money and the pursuit of personal success while disregarding the interests of others. With unprecedented levels of economic inequality, the top 20 percent own almost 90 percent of the total wealth in the country. As economic inequality gets worse, negative outcomes like obesity and violence are exacerbated, and physical health, social trust, and social mobility all decrease. However, small psychological interventions can help restore levels of empathy and egalitarianism. Even the wealthy become just as generous as the poor after reminders of the needs of others in society.

In this section, the speaker highlights the issue of inequality in society and how it can be addressed. He mentions the Harvard commencement speech in which the speaker talked about applying discoveries to reduce inequity. The Giving Pledge is also noted, where wealthy individuals are donating half their fortunes to charity. The emergence of grassroots movements, such as "We are the 1 percent," "Resource Generation," and "Wealth for Common Good," is also discussed. These movements involve wealthy individuals leveraging their own resources to advocate for social policies that may be against their own economic interests, but could help reduce inequality and restore the American dream.
