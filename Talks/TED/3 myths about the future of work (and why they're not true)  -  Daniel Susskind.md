# Summary of 3 myths about the future of work (and why they're not true) | Daniel Susskind

In this video, Daniel Susskind debunks three myths about the future of work. Firstly, he argues against the Terminator myth that machines will replace humans in the workplace, instead saying that technological progress also complements human work. Secondly, Susskind challenges the Intelligence myth that machines need to think like humans to outperform them, arguing that machines can perform tasks in novel ways. Finally, he confronts the lump of labor fallacy, noting that while technological progress may create new jobs, it is not a guarantee that humans will occupy those jobs. Susskind suggests that we must ensure that everyone benefits from the economic prosperity generated by technology and that technological unemployment is a good problem to have because it's a sign of economic success.

In this section, the speaker confronts the Terminator myth that machines aim to replace human beings in the workplace. He explains that as productivity increases and incomes rise due to technological progress, new industries arise and new tasks need to be performed, creating new roles that humans can fill. This means that technological progress does not just substitute for human beings, but it also complements them and makes their work more valuable and important. In addition, the speaker introduces the second myth called the Intelligence myth, explaining that machines do not necessarily have to copy the way humans think and reason to outperform them.

In this section, the speaker debunks the myth that certain tasks are non-routine and thus impossible to automate. Advances in technology have made the routine-nonroutine distinction increasingly irrelevant. For instance, Stanford researchers developed a system that used pattern recognition algorithms to diagnose skin lesions, outperforming human dermatologists. Machines are not limited by our current understanding of human intelligence and may perform tasks in novel ways. Additionally, the speaker argues against the lump of labor fallacy that suggests technological progress creates unemployment. Rather, progress creates new opportunities and innovations that lead to a larger "lump of work."

In this section, the speaker challenges the myth of the lump of labor fallacy, which argues that the advancement of technology does not necessarily cause job losses but rather creates new jobs. According to the speaker, while technological progress can indeed create more jobs, it is not a guarantee that humans will be the ones occupying those jobs. The speaker argues that machines will not only complement humans but also complement machines themselves as technology advances, making them more capable of performing new tasks that were initially reserved for humans. This trend leads to a troubling future in which machines encroach on tasks performed by humans, weakening the force of machine complementarity and favoring machines instead of humans. Nonetheless, the speaker views technological unemployment as a good problem to have since it is a symptom of economic success that requires finding a way to ensure that everyone gets a slice of the economic pie.

In the final section of the video, the speaker highlights the collective challenge of ensuring that everyone benefits from the material prosperity generated by our economic system in a world where traditional work is withering away. He suggests that solving this problem will require thinking in different ways, and while there may be disagreements, it is important to remember that it is a far better problem to have than the one that plagued our ancestors: how to make the pie big enough in the first place.
