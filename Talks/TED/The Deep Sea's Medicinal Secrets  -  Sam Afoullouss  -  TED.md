# Summary of The Deep Sea's Medicinal Secrets | Sam Afoullouss | TED

In this TED talk, Sam Afoullouss discusses how researchers are exploring the oceans to find potential medicines. While over half of our medicines are derived from natural sources, the oceans have remained an underexplored area. The deep-sea coral reefs are incredibly biodiverse and contain unique species that have developed chemical warfare as a means of survival and competition for resources. Researchers are attempting to isolate the toxic compounds produced by these ecosystems to develop future antibiotics and anti-cancer therapies. Techniques such as taking the genes carrying the biological recipes for producing molecules from these organisms and inserting them into microbes are being developed to produce medicines sustainably and cost-effectively. Furthermore, the potential profits from pharmaceutical sales could provide the financial sustainability to explore and protect these reefs, which are already in danger due to threats like deep-sea mining.

In this section, Sam Afoullouss explains how researchers are turning to Mother Nature for help in finding medicines of the future. Organisms contain specialized metabolites that defend themselves from diseases and predators. Scientists have traveled around the world searching for these medicinal molecules, resulting in over half of our medicines derived from natural sources. However, one area that remained underexplored was the oceans. The oceans are the most biodiverse ecosystems on our planet, and scientists are now exploring them to find new potential medicines. Seventeen medicines in local pharmacies and hospitals are derived from marine sources, including ziconotide, a painkiller 1,000 times stronger than morphine that is produced by the magical cone snail.

In this section, the speaker discusses the exploration of the deep-sea coral reefs and their extreme conditions using a robotic submarine. Despite the harsh environment, these reefs are incredibly biodiverse and contain unique species, leaving much of the ocean unexplored. The battle for survival and competition for resources in these ecosystems among different species led to the development of chemical warfare. The speaker aims to isolate the toxic compounds produced by these ecosystems to develop future antibiotics and anti-cancer therapies. By soaking the corals and sponges in alcohol to extract, researchers can test their ability to fight various diseases. The high level of biodiversity and abundance of the species in the deep-sea creates opportunities for new medicines from complex natural compounds.

In this section, the speaker explains how researchers are isolating and testing molecules found in deep-sea organisms as potential medicines for diseases. However, they cannot extract these organisms from the reef because it will destroy the vital biodiversity that creates these molecules. Instead, they can use cutting-edge techniques to take the genes which carry the biological recipes for producing these molecules and insert them into microbes to produce medicines sustainably and cost-effectively. Moreover, potential profits from pharmaceutical sales could provide the financial sustainability to explore and protect these reefs, which are already in more danger now than ever before due to threats like deep-sea mining.
