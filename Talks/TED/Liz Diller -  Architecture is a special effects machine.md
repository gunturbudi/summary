# Summary of Liz Diller: Architecture is a special effects machine

In this video, Liz Diller discusses her work in the field of architecture and how it is often used to create special effects. She shows a video of an unfinished exhibition pavilion made out of water that is filtered and shot through high-pressure fog nozzles. She then discusses how the ICA in Boston balances outward focus with inward focus. Finally, she discusses the challenges of designing an intimacy into a 1,100-seat chamber music hall.

Liz Diller's work in the 1980s and 1990s was focused on creating installations and media projects. In 2003, the Whitney exhibited retrospective of her work. The show featured pieces from the 1980s and 1990s, but the work resisted the nature of a retrospective. For a performance piece in 2003, the walls of the Whitney were made into an increasingly unstable element, with holes opening up sections of wall.
