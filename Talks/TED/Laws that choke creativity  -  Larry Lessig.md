# Summary of Laws that choke creativity | Larry Lessig

Larry Lessig discusses the shift from a read-write culture to a read-only culture. He examines the impact of technology on the architecture of copyright law, arguing that the democratization of creative tools through digital technologies has challenged existing laws. He highlights the need for a balance between extreme sides of the copyright debate through private solutions that embrace making work more freely available for non-commercial or amateur use. Ultimately, Lessig argues that we need to build artist choice while also recognizing the technology that makes our kids different cannot be stopped or criminalized, and we must do better in a democracy.

In this section, Larry Lessig discusses the shift from a read-write culture where people participate in the creation and recreation of their culture to a read-only culture where creativity is consumed but the consumer is not a creator. He uses the example of John Philip Sousa who believed that talking machines would take away the capacity for people to participate in creating culture leading to a read-only culture where creativity was top-down focused. In addition, Lessig looks at the case of two farmers who took their complaint to Lord Blackstone after airplanes started flying over their farm causing their chickens to fly into walls, saying that the airplanes were trespassing. However, the Supreme Court ruled that the doctrine protecting land all the way to the sky no longer had a place in the modern world due to advancements in technology.

In this section, Lessig discusses the battle over control of the music industry and how the legal cartel ASCAP raised rates 448% until the broadcasters formed a more democratic option called BMI, causing ASCAP to crack when broadcasters switched to BMI. This, along with two other stories, leads into his argument that the internet's revival of the read-write culture, and user-generated content that celebrates amateur culture, is an opportunity for this kind of creativity to spread in valuable ways. Lessig highlights examples such as Anime Music Videos to illustrate how people remix songs to make something different and how it's an extension of Sousa's romanticized young people together, singing the songs of the day of old songs.

In this section, Larry Lessig discusses the democratization of creative tools through digital technologies and how this has challenged the architecture of copyright law. He emphasizes that this form of remixing is not piracy but rather an important literacy for the current generation. However, he notes that copyright law has not yet responded with common sense and that there is growing extremism from both sides in the debate. On one side, new technologies are being built to take down any content with copyrighted material without fair use consideration, while on the other side, a growing generation rejects copyright altogether.

In this section, Lessig argues that both extreme sides of the debate over copyright laws are wrong and that the balance he fights for needs to be achieved through private solutions instead. He believes that artists and creators must embrace the idea of making their work more freely available, either for non-commercial or amateur use, and businesses that build free content platforms must also support these ideas to enable them to grow. Ultimately, Lessig argues that we need to build artist choice so that new technologies can be open for business while also recognizing that the technology that makes our kids different cannot be stopped or criminalized, and we must do better in a democracy.
