In this section, Victor Rios proposes three strategies that teachers like Ms. Russ can use to succeed with young people. Firstly, Rios suggests getting rid of the deficit perspective where students are seen as empty containers to fill with knowledge rather than people with life experiences that can benefit their learning. Secondly, he suggests valuing the stories of overcoming adversity that young people bring with them to the classroom, as these already have grit, resilience, and character. Lastly, adequate resources are essential to help young people succeed, including job training, mentoring, counseling, and restorative justice in every high school in America. All of these strategies are part of creating a system that helps students like William realize they have a purpose in life and can help to heal the souls of people in their communities.
