In this section, the speaker discusses various maps that can show us more than just geography. He first shows a map that depicts population growth, which has slowed down over the years. The map also highlights significant events that affected world population such as WWII and the pandemic in 1918. The speaker also shows maps of areas with little water, regions where we grow our food, and a map of the world at night.

In this section, Dorling talks about the good news stories that we tend to ignore while focusing on the immediate bad news. For instance, infant morality rates have decreased at an incredible rate while women are the highest number of young people attending universities. Dorling's last map shows the earth with the seas and oceans removed, and you can see there are around 7.4 billion people worldwide. China has the largest population, and India is in the center of this new world. In this stable, urbanizing, aging, and connecting world, although there are many things that we need to be worried about, there is no need to fear each other as much as we do.
