# Summary of Eva Vertes: My dream about the future of medicine

Eva Vertes discusses her work on cancer stem cells and her hypothesis that cancer does not commonly metastasize to skeletal muscle because of its terminally differentiated cells and lack of angiogenesis. She discusses a study that found that when skeletal muscle is injured, this is correlated with increased metastases to skeletal muscle and how the chemokine network might be involved in cancer metastasis.

Detail Summary:

Eva Vertes tells the story of her grandmother and the Holocaust, her family's escape from Hungary, and her discovery of her love for medicine while researching the effects of heavy metals on the nervous system. She tells the story of her undergraduate research project investigating the effects of guanidine on Alzheimer's disease cells.

Eva Vertes discusses her work on cancer stem cells, which she believes is a more accurate way to look at cancer than the current approach of trying to eliminate it. She cites research that suggests skeletal muscle is resistant to cancer and that metastases to this area are rare.

Eva Vertes discusses her hypothesis that cancer does not commonly metastasize to skeletal muscle because of its terminally differentiated cells and lack of angiogenesis. She hypothesizes that an anti-angiogenic factor or routing factor might be able to prevent cancer from metastasizing. Additionally, she discusses a study that found that when skeletal muscle is injured, this is correlated with increased metastases to skeletal muscle. Finally, she discusses the importance of the chemokine network in cancer metastasis and how skeletal muscle might be resistant to chemokine signals.

This woman discusses her dream of the future of medicine, in which cancer can be treated with a compound that converts tumor cells into skeletal muscle cells. However, this idea is far-fetched, and more research needs to be done in this area.
