# Summary of The surprising connection between brain injuries and crime | Kim Gorgens

Half to 80 percent of people in the criminal justice system have a traumatic brain injury (TBI) that was caused mainly by physical assault according to a video by TED-Ed. These patients face cognitive deficiencies such as poor judgement and impulse control. Researchers in Colorado have developed a neuropsychological testing program that identifies cognitive weaknesses and makes the criminal justice system safer and more efficient for everyone. The brain injury program is centered around self-advocacy and enables inmates to take responsibility for their behavior by changing the perception of their behavior as what they can't do rather than what they won't do. The program provides tools like notebooks, reminders, and taking frequent breaks to manage memory or attention problems. Judge Brian Bowen plays a crucial role in the program by offering additional support to move correctional defendants out of the system. Additionally, positive success stories like the rehabilitation of military veteran Mike showcase the importance of simple accommodations, resiliency, and responsibility.

In this section, we learn about the surprising connection between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and crime. Shockingly, 50 to 80% of people in the criminal justice system have a TBI, often as a result of physical assault. These individuals face cognitive impairments like poor judgment and impulse control, making the criminal justice system a revolving door for them. A group of researchers in Colorado has developed a program to identify these cognitive weaknesses through neuropsychological testing and recommend modifications to the system to make it more effective and safer for all involved. This program has the potential to disrupt the cycle of recidivism, making society safer and improving outcomes for inmates and probationers.

In this section, Kim Gorgens explains how the brain injury program focuses on self-advocacy and helps inmates take responsibility for their behavior. The program does not excuse anyone's behavior but changes the perception of problematic behavior as the things they can't do rather than the things they won't do. These tools based on their test results, can help inmates manage themselves and their memory or attention problems like carrying a notebook, reminder or calendar applications, and taking frequent breaks. Furthermore, the judge is crucial to make the system work for everyone and move correctional defendants out of the system with additional support. Judge Brian Bowen proves this by identifying the relationship between Navy veteran Mikeâ€™s 70-foot fall history and his difficulty in showing up on the right day for court appointments.

In this section, the speaker shares a success story about a veteran named Mike who suffered a traumatic brain injury and ended up in the criminal justice system. Instead of sentencing him to more jail time, Judge Bowen provided him with maps, checklists, handouts, and vocational rehabilitation, allowing him to repair his relationships with his family and graduate from the veteran's court. This program highlights the high prevalence of brain injuries and cognitive deficits in the criminal justice system and emphasizes the importance of resilience and responsibility, as well as how simple accommodations can lead to transformation and a change in perception.
