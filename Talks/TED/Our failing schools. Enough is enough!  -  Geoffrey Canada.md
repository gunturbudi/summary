In this section, Geoffrey Canada expresses his frustration about the failing education system.

In this section, Geoffrey Canada talks about how the lack of changes in the education system has led to failing schools. The system currently enforces a summer break for schools every year, which was originally instituted in the 1840s when parents needed a place for their kids to go. Today, science tells us that kids' education is most important in the early years of life, and poor kids need education, pre-kindergarten experiences, and health services more than anyone. Still, most American schools do not offer these services in summer, pre-kindergarten or health. The fact that testing occurs at the end of the school year and results don't come back until the summer is over also prevails, making it impossible to impose immediate change.
