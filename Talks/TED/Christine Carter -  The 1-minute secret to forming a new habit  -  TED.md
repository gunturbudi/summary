She argues that big, audacious goals can often set us up for failure and that the key to establishing a new habit is to start small with a minimal effort that requires little motivation. The speaker provides an example of how she started exercising again by committing to only one minute of running per day, and how this minimal effort eventually built momentum towards longer runs. She encourages listeners to embrace the idea of being bad at something and accept minimal effort as a starting point towards building new habits.

In this section, Christine Carter shares her advice on forming a new habit, emphasizing the importance of starting small and doing something that is better than nothing. The goal is repetition, rather than high achievement or motivation, to establish a neural pathway in our brain that makes the habit easier to do without much willpower or effort. By initiating a behavior, even if it is incredibly easy, we can hardwire it into our brains to make it more likely that we'll succeed with something more ambitious later on. Carter warns against the temptation to do more than our designated better-than-nothing habit, which can introduce difficulty, force, and negotiation with ourselves, and eliminates the possibility of making it easy and enjoyable.
