In the early days of sampling, artists could sample from any and all music to create their own music. 30 years later, sampling has become an incredibly popular and ubiquitous technique in music, with artists taking elements from old records to create new and unique sounding music. In 1984, two hip-hop legends, Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh, released "La Di Da Di," which became the fifth-most sampled song of all time. In 1997, the Notorious B.I.G. released his hit "Hypnotize" which samples "La Di Da Di."

In the late 1990s, a young 13-year-old boy in Brooklyn would have been familiar with "La Di Da Di" by Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh. Mark Ronson collaborated with the late Amy Winehouse on her album "Back to Black," and the song's sonic direction was largely due to Ronson's and Salaam Remi's production. Miley Cyrus reinterpreted "La Di Da Di" for her generation on her album "Bangerz." While the original song may not have aged well, Cyrus' contemporary interpretations make it more current. Altogether, sampling has become more prevalent and accepted in contemporary music.
