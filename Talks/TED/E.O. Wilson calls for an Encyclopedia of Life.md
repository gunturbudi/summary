# Summary of E.O. Wilson calls for an Encyclopedia of Life

E.O. Wilson, a biologist, urges for urgent action to explore and understand the small world that composes the foundation of our ecosystems. He emphasizes the need to create an Encyclopedia of Life to document and disseminate the knowledge gained from this exploration to protect the rest of life and humanity. Wilson highlights the importance of researching the vast array of undiscovered creatures necessary for human life and encourages the creation of an encyclopedia to preserve the Earth's biodiversity and inspire a new generation of biologists.

In this section, E.O. Wilson explains his deep appreciation for the diversity of life on Earth, starting from his childhood on the Gulf Coast of Alabama, where he became fascinated by the beauty of the natural world. Wilson asserts that his interest in small creatures led him to a frontier in biology, which remains unknown to science. He emphasizes the need to explore and understand this small world that composes the foundation of our ecosystems and to create an Encyclopedia of Life to disseminate the knowledge gained from this exploration. Wilson urges the world to take action for the conservation and protection of this small world and, by doing so, to protect the rest of life and humanity with it.

In this section, E.O. Wilson explains the vast amount of undiscovered biodiversity on Earth, including the immense number of bacterial species that have yet to be researched. Despite the discovery of new species such as whales, antelopes, and monkeys, the majority of the world's bacteria are still unknown, with only a small percentage having been diagnosed by scientists. Wilson emphasizes the importance of researching the vast array of undiscovered creatures necessary for human life and encourages the creation of an Encyclopedia of Life to document and understand them.

In this section, the speaker discusses the vast and mostly unknown world of viruses and the potential for finding true aliens among the enormous diversity of microorganisms. Scientists are rapidly advancing with the aid of new genomic technology and sequencers, allowing for the exploration of microbial biodiversity and the discovery of unknown species. Despite the temptation to view the biosphere holistically, each species, even the tiniest Prochlorococcus, is seen as a masterpiece of evolution that has persisted for thousands to millions of years and is exquisitely adapted to its environment.

In this section, E.O. Wilson highlights the importance of biodiversity and the risks we face due to the HIPPO juggernaut, which is permanently eroding Earth's ancient biosphere. He stresses that we need to urgently change our approach, settle down, and explore the biosphere to fully understand and competently manage it. This project should be considered as a biological moonshot with a defined timetable, and we need to view the encyclopedia of life as a big science project, equivalent to the Human Genome Project, and get to it now before it is too late.

In this section, E.O. Wilson advocates for the creation of an "Encyclopedia of Life" - an expandable online encyclopedia contributed to by scientists and amateurs alike, with a page for each species on earth. Wilson believes that the technology for such an encyclopedia now exists, and that it would make information about all life on earth accessible to anyone, anywhere. Additionally, Wilson believes that the encyclopedia would have practical applications, would inspire a new generation of biologists, and would help to preserve the earth's biodiversity. He calls on people to help make this dream a reality.
