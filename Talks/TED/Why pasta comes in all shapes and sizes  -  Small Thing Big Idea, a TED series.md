In this section, the speaker explains that pasta design is about how it performs, whether it's ribbed or smooth, and how it feels on the palate. The taxonomy of pasta is divided into fresh pasta, which could be either flour and water or flour and eggs, and dry pasta, which is always durum wheat flour and water. Different shapes of pasta have unique functions when paired with certain sauces. For instance, ribbed shells scoop up sauce on the outside and are smooth on the inside. Pasta design is a culmination of centuries of grandmothers and chefs improving the thinness of pasta walls, which means that it belongs to the people, not a single designer or inventor.
