# Summary of Why the best hire might not have the perfect resume | Regina Hartley

Regina Hartley argues in her video that candidates with a varied work history, called "Scrappers," may be more valuable employees than those with a perfect resume. Scrappers have had to fight against the odds in their lives and have developed characteristics such as a strong sense of purpose, a positive outlook, and commitment to their goals. Additionally, companies that prioritize diversity and inclusivity tend to outperform their peers by supporting Scrappers. Thus, it is better to hire underestimated contenders with drive and determination than those with superficial qualifications but lacking passion.
