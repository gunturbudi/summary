In this video, Seth Godin discusses how to get your ideas to spread by focusing on what is remarkable. He argues that in a world where consumers have more choices and less time, the only way to get people's attention is to be remarkable. He provides the example of Arby's 85 million dollar promotion for an oven mitt with the voice of Tom Arnold. Copernicus, a talking cow, is also introduced.

Seth Godin advises against marketing to people who are "really good" at ignoring you, but to market to those who care and are obsessed with something. He provides the example of Krispy Kreme, which uses "otaku"--those who are obsessed with a subject--to spread its products. Fastest-growing businesses in the mortuary industry typically do not market heavily, relying on word of mouth instead. Seth Godin also provides examples of Pearl Jam and Fastlane, two bands that have released numerous successful albums and are not marketed to primarily through advertising.
