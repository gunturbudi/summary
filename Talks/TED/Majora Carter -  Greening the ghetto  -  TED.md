In this section, Majora Carter talks about her experience of fighting for sustainable development in urban areas, specifically in the South Bronx where environmental burdens from waste facilities and power plants have led to health problems like obesity, diabetes, and asthma, with low-income communities of color bearing the brunt of the impact. Carter emphasizes the need for environmental justice, where no community is saddled with disproportionate burdens, and proposes solutions that won't compromise the short-term lives of low-income communities of color nor their long-term survival.

In this section, Majora Carter describes how economic degradation leads to environmental and social degradation. Red-lining was used by banks to exclude sections of the city from investment, leading to a lack of jobs among other problems. Antiquated zoning and land-use regulations continue to put polluting facilities in certain neighborhoods, while the disinvestment in the Bronx brought about environmental injustices. Majora Carter and her team decided to do their own planning, which included building a small park that became the first stage in the Greenway movement in the South Bronx. By nurturing the natural environment and creating green-collar jobs, the community is slowly being seeded towards environmental responsibility. They also built New York City's first green and cool roof demonstration project, which can be used instead of petroleum-based roofing materials that absorb heat and contribute to the urban "heat island" effect.

In this section, Majora Carter discusses the benefits of green roofs in reducing the need for costly end-of-pipe solutions and providing habitats for wildlife. She highlights her own demonstration project and the creation of a green roof installation business in the South Bronx, which brought jobs and sustainable economic activity. Carter also talks about the similarities between the South Bronx and New Orleans' Ninth Ward, both being waterfront communities with poor people of color, and how they can both learn from grassroots activists to take proactive steps towards sustainable development. She advocates for a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis and sustainable community-friendly development that can make a profit, rather than developments that hyper-exploit vulnerable communities for profit. Carter also draws inspiration from visionary mayors in other cities, such as Enrique Pe√±alosa of Bogota, who expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes while reducing car usage in the city.

In this section, Majora Carter discusses the example set by the city of Bogota on how a people-first agenda can improve the lives of citizens while also addressing urban problems on a tight budget. She argues that in the US, the idea that development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population is still considered radical. Carter urges her TED audience to use their influence in support of comprehensive, sustainable change everywhere and to democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table. She calls for the inclusion of grassroots groups in the decision-making process, as they bring valuable experience and intelligence to the table. By working together, she believes that individuals can change the world.
