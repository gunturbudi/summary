In this video, Jennifer Golbeck explains why likes on social media say more than people might think. She argues that a smart person may have started the curly fry page, or one of the first people to like it may have had high intelligence. The likes then spread to other smart people, and by homophily, the action of liking the page is indicative of high intelligence. There is no inherent value in the content of the page, but the action of liking reflects common attributes among other people who have done it. Social media companies rely on user data to make money, but users can control how this data is used by encrypting it and withholding consent to use it. By encouraging science and supporting researchers who want to give users more control over their data, social media companies may be able to slow the spread of inaccurate information.
