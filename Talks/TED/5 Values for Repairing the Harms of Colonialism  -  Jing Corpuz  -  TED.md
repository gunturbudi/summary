This video discusses the five values that Indigenous peoples hold for repairing the harms of colonialism. These values include the importance of community, the belief that land, water, and resources are not just for oneself, and the importance of honoring the hands that have contributed to our cultures and livelihoods. These values clash with the mindset of those who view land and resources as belonging to the few and for the benefit of themselves, and they argue that this type of development aggression is an extension of a version of capitalism that prioritizes overconsumption, overproduction, and lack of respect for the future.
