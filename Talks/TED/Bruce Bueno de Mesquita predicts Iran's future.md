# Summary of Bruce Bueno de Mesquita predicts Iran's future

In this video, Bruce Bueno de Mesquita uses game theory to predict that Iran will not build a nuclear bomb by 2011, but will instead only show that they know how to make one. He argues that this is in Iran's best interest, and that exhortations to change their behavior will not be effective.

Professor Bruce Bueno de Mesquita predicts that Iran will behave in a way that is in its own best interest, and that this will limit the effectiveness of exhortations to change their behavior. Bueno de Mesquita uses game theory to help understand how people will pursue their interests. He argues that only two exceptions to rationality exist- two-year olds and schizophrenics.

The Director of National Intelligence, maybe the ambassador to the United Nations, or somebody else, predicts that Iran's future will be determined by a complex mix of factors, including the opinions of those in positions of power and the individual decisions of those in charge. Smart people can keep track of up to 240 pieces of information, compared to the 120 needed by five people, when the number of decision-makers is doubled. The article says that, because computers can process information faster than humans, they can overcome the limitation of fewer decision-makers and predict the behavior of those in charge more accurately.

Bruce Bueno de Mesquita predicts that, by 2011, Iran will have built enough weapons-grade fuel to show that they know how to make a bomb, but will not actually build a bomb. He bases this prediction on a computer simulation of Iranian decision-making that takes into account the opinions of 87 different individuals and outside factors.

Bruce Bueno de Mesquita forecasts that the moneyed interests in Iran are growing in political clout, and that Iran is going in an unhealthy direction opposed to what Khomeini had in mind. Ahmadinejad is getting weaker and is not a major player in Iran. The Ayatollahs, based mostly in Qom, are growing in power and are going to be getting louder. Bueno de Mesquita leaves attendees with the hope that people in Iran will pay more attention to his talk and engage in the same sorts of calculations in order to hasten an agreement and arrive at an agreement everyone is happy with.
