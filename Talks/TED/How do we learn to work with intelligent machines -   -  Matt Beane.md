# Summary of How do we learn to work with intelligent machines? | Matt Beane

Matt Beane discusses how the use of AI is obstructing on-the-job learning and preventing workers from gaining new skills through hands-on practice. This impacts various industries, such as surgery, policing, and investment banking, where workers are struggling to advance due to AI taking over tasks that could be opportunities for learning. Beane suggests using "shadow learning" and building in struggles and expert support into AI implementation to benefit the learning process and enable workers to take full advantage of AI's capabilities while enhancing their skills. He concludes by emphasizing that the time to do so is now, as half a billion to a billion individuals are estimated to have to adapt to AI in their daily work by 2030.

In this section, the speaker describes how AI is being handled in ways that block the traditional path of learning, through apprenticeship, mentorship, and on-the-job training. The problem is demonstrated with an example from surgery, where a resident is unable to advance to riskier and harder tasks because a robot is used to do the job more quickly and accurately. The speaker conducted a two and a half year study observing dozens of surgeons and residents, and discovered that many were in the same position, struggling to learn and advance in their professional skills due to AI taking over tasks that could be opportunities for learning. The issue extends to other industries as well, such as policing and investment banking.

In this section, speaker Matt Beane discusses the impact of AI on on-the-job learning and how organizations are peeling learners away from expert work in order to try and get more results from AI. Half a billion to a billion individuals are estimated to have to adapt to AI in their daily work by 2030. However, on-the-job learning is becoming harder, obstructing workers from gaining new skills where hands-on practice is limited. Beane discusses 'shadow learning,' a bending and breaking of rules by a small group of workers who understood the need to struggle and challenge themselves. They took serious risks to learn new skills and believed struggle and challenge were necessary variables to push themselves to tackle hard problems right near the edge of their capacity. Matt suggests that struggle and expert support can be built into AI implementation to benefit this process, enabling workers to take full advantage of AI's capabilities while enhancing their skills as they do it. He ends by stating the time to do so is now.
