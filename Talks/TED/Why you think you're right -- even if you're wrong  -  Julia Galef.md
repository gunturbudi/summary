In the Dreyfus Affair, the officers convicted Alfred Dreyfus based on evidence that seemed convincing to them even though outside experts were not as confident in the similarity of his handwriting. Galef argues that this is an example of motivated reasoning, or the phenomenon in which our unconscious motivations, desires, and fears shape the way we interpret information.

Julia Galef discusses the idea that good judgment is not about how smart you are or how much you know, but about how you feel. She cites a quote from Saint-Exup√©ry that says, "If you want to build a ship, don't drum up your men to collect wood and give orders and distribute the work. Teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea." She urges the audience to think about what they most yearn for and to work towards achieving those goals.
