# Summary of Jason Clay: How big brands can help save biodiversity

Jason Clay, in his talk titled "How big brands can help save biodiversity," stresses upon the need to work with industries instead of individual companies to address consumption and sustainability as a pre-competitive issue. Clay notes that the top 100 companies controlling 25% of the trade of the 15 most significant commodities on the planet hold immense power to promote sustainability through their corporate strategies. Clay encourages these companies to demand sustainable products, which could cause a shift towards sustainability by pulling up to 50% of production. He highlights the successes of roundtables initiated globally where the entire value chain, including brands, producers, and retailers, works together to discuss key impacts and design global benchmarks and standards. Companies like Cargill, Mars, and Coca-Cola are taking measures to make their supply chains sustainable and reduce environmental strains while adapting to population growth.

In this section, Jason Clay shares his experience of working with refugees and famine victims before transitioning to his work with conservation efforts. He tells the story of Rainforest Crunch, an initiative to save the rainforest by using nuts from the rainforest for ice cream, which failed because it only targeted the wrong driver. Instead of gathering Brazil nuts (which didn't contribute to forest cutting) they needed to focus on lumber, beef, and soy, things that they were not focused on. Clay reminds us that we live on a finite planet and consumption must be balanced with population growth. The current state shows that we have crossed the line of being in a sustainable relationship with the planet since 1990 and we are currently living off the principal, not the interest.

In this section, Jason Clay discusses the issue of consumption and how the Earth's resources are being used. He notes that as the world population grows, so does consumption, and it is impossible to triple production in order to meet the demands of consumers. Therefore, there is a need to reduce consumption and have sustainability as a pre-competitive issue. Sustainability should be an issue that everyone cares about and groups must work together to address it. Clay identifies 35 places globally where we need to work to save biodiversity and 15 commodities that pose the biggest threats to these places. The question is, who should be worked with to change the way these commodities are produced?

In this section, Jason Clay emphasizes the importance of working with the top 100 companies that control 25% of the trade of the 15 most significant commodities on the planet. If these companies start demanding sustainable products, they could pull up to 50% of production, and corporations can push producers faster than consumers, causing a shift towards sustainability. Clay encourages working with industries instead of individual companies and reveals the success of the roundtables they have initiated globally. These roundtables bring together the entire value chain, from producers to brands and retailers, along with civil society, NGOs, researchers and scientists, to discuss key impacts and design global benchmarks and standards. By utilizing the big risk these companies face, which is not having a product to sell due to lack of availability, they have already signed agreements with 40 companies and hope to bring the remaining 20 to the table soon. Cargill is one of the companies that has started the journey towards sustainability and funded research to double global palm oil production without deforestation.

In this section, the speaker highlights the important role of big brands like Cargill and Mars in promoting sustainability through their corporate strategies. Cargill, which holds 20 to 25 percent of global palm oil, has undertaken studies to identify lands for sustainable palm oil plantation and to make their supply chains third-party certified under credible programs. Cargill can be instrumental in moving the entire palm oil industry and can influence the Chinese market by shipping only sustainable products. Mars is producing more sustainable cocoa by identifying the most productive and drought-tolerant traits in plants and making the information public to encourage everyone to make cocoa farming even more productive and sustainable. Companies like Coca-Cola are also buying and bundling externalities like carbon and water, which brings them back into the price of commodities. The speaker urges companies to change the way they think about sustainability and adapt to the unprecedented growth of the world's population while taking action to reduce environmental strains.
