# Summary of What is economic value, and who creates it? | Mariana Mazzucato

In this video, Mariana Mazzucato discusses how the division of labor between different activities in the economy creates economic value. She explains that in order to measure the economy and understand its workings, we need to rethink how we measure production, value, and productivity. She also discusses how recent increases in the prices of antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals have caused public outcry.

Economic value is the difference between what something is worth to someone and what someone is willing to pay for it. The term has been contested within the economics profession, with some arguing that it is simply a matter of production efficiency while others argue that it is tied to the creation of products that are needed or wanted by others. 300 years ago, classical economists were concerned with the redistribution of value created by the productive and sterile classes in society.

This video discusses the economic value that is created and who creates it. Adam Smith argued that if you only have one person making pins, at most you can make one pin a day. However, if you invest in factory production and the division of labor, new thinking--today known as organizational innovation--then you can increase the productivity and the growth and the wealth of nations. This change from objective to subjective was a big revolution and is still a part of neoclassical economics. Today, finance is seen as something that produces new value, rather than just moving value around.

Mariana Mazzucato discusses how the division of labor between different activities in the economy creates economic value. She discusses how the banking problem, which was caused by the commercial banks paying out more for deposits than they were earning in interest, was ignored because it was given a name, "financial intermediation," and how this created a problem of reinvestment because most of the profits generated by finance were being siphoned off instead of being reinvested back into the real economy. Mazzucato also discusses how prices reveal the value of goods and how recent increases in the prices of antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals have caused public outcry.

Mariana Mazzucato explains that in order to measure the economy and understand its workings, we need to rethink how we measure production, value, and productivity. She goes on to say that we should be focusing on what is included in a price, not just what is added to it, and that we should also reform finance to help create new types of value. She finishes by saying that we should ask ourselves whether or not certain failures are actually part of the value creation process.
