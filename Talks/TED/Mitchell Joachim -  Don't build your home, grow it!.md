# Summary of Mitchell Joachim: Don't build your home, grow it!

Architect Mitchell Joachim advocates for "growing" homes instead of building them, using technology like pleaching trees and training plants into specific geometries to make homes like the Fab Tree Hab. He emphasizes the environmental benefits, such as carbon absorption, and shows a proposal for a regenerative in-vitro meat habitat using fatty cell insulation and cilia for wind loads. Although unconventional, the merging of biology and architecture has the potential for great innovation.

In this section, Mitchell Joachim, an architect, talks about growing homes instead of building them, as a way to combat the "McHouses" in America. He explains the technology of pleaching or grafting trees together and training plants into a specific geometry to make a home called Fab Tree Hab that is a part of the environment. Joachim emphasizes the environmental benefits of growing homes, such as absorbing carbon, as well as the potential to create a regenerative in-vitro meat habitat. He shows a proposal for a meat house that uses fatty cells as insulation, cilia for dealing with wind loads, and sphincter muscles for doors and windows, which although it may seem ugly, presents the potential for architecture and biology to become one.
