# Summary of The Story We Tell About Poverty Isn't True | Mia Birdsong | TED Talks

Mia Birdsong challenges the common narrative surrounding poverty, arguing that despite millions of dollars invested in non-profit organizations and think tanks, poverty rates have remained largely unchanged. She argues that impoverished communities are full of talented individuals who simply lack the same opportunities and luck as those who have succeeded, and that poor people should be recognized as experts in their own lives. Rather than imposing solutions, she advocates for listening to the stories of those experiencing poverty and working with them to create new, more comprehensive approaches to reducing poverty.

In this section, the speaker explains that despite millions of dollars invested in non-profit organizations and the creation of think tanks in the last 50 years, poverty rates haven't significantly changed since the War on Poverty was launched. She believes that people who are poor have been overlooked, and that they are the most powerful and practical resource for reducing poverty. She gives examples of people who are poor, such as a group of mothers who started their own cleaning business to supplement their income, and a mother who created a support group for parents to help her daughter do well academically and socially. Finally, she introduces Baakir, who runs BlackStar Books and Caffe out of his house, and greets people with a "Welcome black home."

In this section, Mia Birdsong discusses her upbringing and how she went from being a poor child who ate Chef Boyardee for an afternoon snack to owning a home in Oakland and having a successful career. She notes, however, that she is the exception, and that marginalized communities are full of talented people who work hard but don't have the same opportunities or luck she had. Birdsong is tired of the narrative that hard work leads to success, which can lead those who make it to believe they deserve it, while those who don't make it must not be working hard enough. She believes this is unfair and ignores the systemic barriers that prevent people from succeeding.

In this section, Mia Birdsong questions the narrative that suggests poor people need fixing, and instead, she urges people to recognize that what's working is the people, and the approach is what's broken. Birdsong advocates for listening to stories that paint a fuller picture of marginalized individuals and families, and recognizing that poor people are experts themselves. Rather than imposing solutions, Birdsong proposes adding fuel to the already-burning flame that poor people have, leveraging their solutions and ideas, and creating new ways of being that work for us.

In this section, Birdsong emphasizes the importance of listening to the true stories of those in poverty, rather than relying on the simplistic narrative that is often told. She calls for a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of poverty that takes into account the various factors at play and the resilience and agency of those experiencing it.
