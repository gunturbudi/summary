# Summary of Tim Jackson: An economic reality check

In the video "Tim Jackson: An Economic Reality Check," Jackson discusses the negative impact of our economic system's focus on growth, novelty, and consumption on the environment, as well as the tension between self-regarding and other-regarding and novelty-seeking and tradition-conservation behaviors in human nature. Jackson proposes a shift towards ecological altruism and prioritizing the protection and nurturing of ecological assets, investing in low-carbon technologies and infrastructure, and creating shared spaces that promote joy and contemplation. He emphasizes the need for an economics fit for purpose and sees civil society and businesses as initiators of change, with political leadership required to create space for such efforts. Jackson also notes the challenge of protecting topsoils and water quality while reducing land use in the transition to a circular economy and reducing carbon emissions.

In this section, economist Tim Jackson discusses the dilemma of growth and how our economy's obsession with growth, novelty, and consumption is hurting the planet. Jackson explains that our constant pursuit of innovation and novelty is stimulated by investment, which encourages further consumption growth, and how this is leading to the depletion of our resources and a negative impact on the environment. He emphasizes that it is important to take a reality check and question if our economic system is capable of delivering the 130-fold improvement in carbon intensity that is needed to combat climate change and reflects on ways to address the sustainability challenge.

In this section, Tim Jackson discusses the economic structure of today's society in relation to the anxiety that drives people's insatiable desire for material goods, and how this behavior has led to the crisis. Despite this, people tend to save rather than spend in times of recession, which is at odds with what the system requires. Additionally, people tend to neglect simple tasks such as energy-efficient measures, not because it does not make economic sense, but because people are too busy with the daily tasks of keeping out the "giraffes."

In this section, Tim Jackson discusses the tension between self-regarding and other-regarding behaviors, as well as the tension between novelty-seeking and tradition-conservation behaviors in human nature. He suggests that we have created economies that privilege and encourage a narrow quadrant of the human soul, leaving other parts unregarded. He proposes a different kind of enterprise, ecological altruism, by presenting Ecosia, an internet search engine that allocates 80% of its revenues to rainforest protection projects. Jackson believes that the future economy should prioritize protecting and nurturing the ecological assets on which our future depends and investing in low-carbon technologies and infrastructures as part of building a meaningful prosperity that provides capabilities.

In this section, Tim Jackson discusses the material dimensions required for people to flourish, including food, clothing, and shelter, as well as social and psychological aims, such as family, friendship, commitments to society, and participation in the life of that society. To achieve this, investment is required to create shared spaces such as parks, libraries, museums that promote joy, celebration, tranquility, and contemplation. Jackson notes the importance of changing the growth-based model of prosperity in the richer nations to make room for growth in the poorest nations. He emphasizes the need for an economics fit for purpose that places a more credible, robust, and realistic vision of what it means to be human at the heart of prosperity. Jackson sees civil society and businesses initiating change, with political leadership required to create the space for such efforts.

In this section, Tim Jackson states that although the transition to a circular economy and the reduction of carbon emissions may be beneficial, the challenge lies in ensuring the protection of topsoils and water quality while reducing land use. If it can be proven that these issues can be addressed while achieving a 2% growth rate, he would be in favor of it.
