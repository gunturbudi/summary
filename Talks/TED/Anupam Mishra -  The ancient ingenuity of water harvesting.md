# Summary of Anupam Mishra: The ancient ingenuity of water harvesting

In the YouTube video "The ancient ingenuity of water harvesting," speaker Anupam Mishra describes the water scarcity issues in the Indian desert, highlighting various techniques used for collecting rainwater. Mishra explains how the government's plan to bring water from the Himalayas failed and how people returned to their traditional water structures to provide themselves with water. Mishra showcases the kunds and the water harvesting techniques used in Rajasthan, praising the villagers' engineering skills and how they have respected and maintained their structures for centuries without funding. Mishra concludes by explaining that the water harvesting techniques presented in the video can be utilized in different areas worldwide, thanks to their adaptability.

In this section, the speaker describes the water scarcity of the Indian desert, which receives the lowest rainfall in the country and has groundwater that is 300 feet deep and mostly saline. Despite this, the people of the desert have developed various techniques for harvesting rainwater, including utilizing kunds—raised platforms that collect rainwater, prevent waste, and store up to 100,000 liters of pure drinking water—and creating bylaws that promote the use of raised water storage tanks. The speaker also showcases the Jaigarh Fort, a 400-year-old canal system that collects six million gallons of rainwater per season and provides clean, pure water that can envy many municipalities.

In this section, Anupam Mishra explains how the government’s plan to bring water from the Himalayas to solve the water scarcity issue in Rajasthan failed terribly. While some areas managed to receive water from the multi-million dollar project, others were just too far away for the water to reach or were covered in water hyacinth, making it unsuitable for use as drinking water. That’s why people returned to renovating their traditional water structures to provide water for themselves. Jaisalmer, a town established 800 years ago, has overcome this challenge with limited rainfall by building 52 beautiful water bodies around the town that collects rainwater drops from every roof and depositing it in the rooms. They also designed water bodies for all seasons, including a small water body called the [unclear] which has the reputation in the desert for never drying up.

In this section, Anupam Mishra showcases the incredible water harvesting techniques used in Rajasthan, India. He explains the concept of kunds, structures that squeeze moisture hidden in sand, which can harvest water throughout the year. Despite receiving only six centimeters of rainfall this year, the villagers here can provide water to cities like Delhi and Bangalore if needed. The villagers have respected and maintained their structures for centuries without any funding, and the stone pillars remind people to protect these structures. Mishra also praises the engineering skills of the people, which led to the establishment of India's first engineering college in 1847.

In this section, Anupam Mishra explains that the water harvesting techniques he presented can be utilized in different areas that receive rainfall. The ponds and open bodies of water can be found in Sri Lanka, Kashmir, and other parts of the world. He also mentions that the kund, which utilizes the gypsum belt, can still be done today if it was present three million years ago but cannot be replicated if it did not exist in the area. Chris Anderson commends Mishra's designs and asks if they can be used elsewhere, to which Mishra explains the adaptability of the techniques.
