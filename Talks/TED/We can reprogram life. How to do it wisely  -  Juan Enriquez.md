# Summary of We can reprogram life. How to do it wisely | Juan Enriquez

In this video, Juan Enriquez discusses the power of lifecode in modifying various forms of life and changing their traits for different purposes. He highlights the ability of humans to insert genes and proteins through intelligent design and compares it to the use of assisted reproductive technologies, such as in-vitro fertilization. Enriquez argues that lifecode editing has the potential to provide significant advancements to society if applied wisely. He proposes five principles for guiding the programming of lifecode: taking responsibility for it, celebrating diversity, respecting others' choices, restricting Darwin's functioning, and participating in its ethics, business, and politics. Enriquez encourages his audience to embrace this possibility of engineering lifecode to see it as the most significant human adventure.

In this section of the video, Juan Enriquez discusses the concept of lifecode and how we are able to program it to change and modify different forms of life for specific purposes. He explains how intelligent design allows us to insert specific genes and proteins to accelerate the process of changing lifecode. Enriquez compares this to the changing of sex and the use of assisted reproductive technologies, such as in-vitro fertilization, which separates sex, conception, and baby. This gives us control over when and where a baby is fertilized and separates the baby from the body and the act of conception. He also discusses the ability to freeze sperm, eggs, and fertilized eggs, highlighting the implications of these technologies.

In this section, Juan Enriquez discusses the power of lifecode in providing significant advancements to society with proper application. Lifecode editing has shifted the natural selection process in a different direction by enabling humans to apply unnatural selection and non-random mutations for changing viruses, animals, and plants for the greater good or obtaining traits not seen in nature. Enriquez highlights the fear surrounding lifecode research and implementation, but notes the risks associated with not acting, such as not being able to cure deadly diseases or feeding the planet's population.

In this section, Juan Enriquez discusses how humans have engineered half the Earth's surface through selective species breeding, leading to the massive alteration of the planet's ecology. He also explains the differences between random and non-random mutations and how humans are now able to engineer genetic mutations, which enables them to program life. Enriquez proposes five principles for guiding wise programming of lifecode: taking responsibility for it, celebrating diversity, respecting other people's choices, restricting Darwin's functioning to a quarter of the Earth, and participating in its ethics, business, and politics. Finally, Enriquez encourages his audience to embrace the possibility of engineering life-code and see it as the most significant human adventure to date, cautioning that it would be a crime for people to ignore or hide from life-code's development.
