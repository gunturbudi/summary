# Summary of The Relationship Between Sex and Imagination | Gina Gutierrez | TED

Gina Gutierrez discusses the importance of imagination in sex and highlights the brain as the biggest sex organ. She points out that many people have a crisis of inspiration during sex, leading them to rely on partners instead of using their own agency. To combat this, Gutierrez started Dipsea to create audio stories that can turn women on. She advises people to settle into their minds and imagine like they would during meditation, creating stories that combine sensory pleasures, places, and people to develop one's vision of what's appealing. Gutierrez stresses that sex is a mental experience and encourages people to flex their imagination muscle to understand what turns them on and communicate those desires to their partners.

She suggests settling into your mind like you would during meditation and imagine your mind as a projector, with everything you can see and experience in front of you.
