McGonigal shares her personal story of how she turned her struggle with concussion-related depression and anxiety into a game, "Jane the Concussion Slayer," which eventually led to the creation of SuperBetter, a game that helps people facing challenges such as cancer, chronic pain, depression, and Crohn's disease.

In this section, Jane McGonigal shares her personal story of how she turned her struggle with concussion-related depression and anxiety into a game with a simple set of rules as a way to help herself. Her game, "Jane the Concussion Slayer," had her adopt a secret identity, recruit allies, battle bad guys, and activate power-ups, all of which ultimately allowed her to recover from the depression and anxiety. The game became so impactful that McGonigal launched SuperBetter, which soon reached people all over the world who were facing challenges such as cancer, chronic pain, depression, and Crohn's disease.

In this section, McGonigal discusses how a game can help people experience post-traumatic growth, which is the opposite of post-traumatic stress disorder, and can lead to stronger and happier individuals. According to research, there are four kinds of strength or resilience that contribute to post-traumatic growth, and scientifically validated activities can be done every day to strengthen them, without needing trauma. McGonigal then leads the audience through four SuperBetter quests to build up physical and mental resilience, and increase determination and willpower. These activities, like exercise, help the body, brain, and heart to cope with stress better, and heal faster.

In this section, Jane McGonigal shares a secret from scientific literature where if you can manage to experience three positive emotions for every negative emotion, you can significantly improve your health and your ability to tackle any problem you are facing, a trick called the "three-to-one positive emotion ratio." The four types of resilience that people should regularly boost are physical, mental, emotional, and social. People who are regularly boosting these four types of resilience live ten years longer than everyone else. By boosting these four types of resilience, every single year that you are boosting them, you earn 0.128 more years of life, or 46 more days of life, or 67,298 more minutes of life.
