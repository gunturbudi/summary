Nick Hanauer discusses how neoliberal economics, which is based on the false assumption that the market is an efficient equilibrium system, has led to increasing inequality and instability. He proposes a new economics that is based on the premise that people are the key to creating prosperity and public good.

The video discusses the three assumptions of neoliberal economics: that prices always reflect value, that humans are self-interested maximizers, and that greed is always good. The video argues that these assumptions are not true and that, in fact, humans are more cooperative than selfish. This is why, under neoliberal economics, wages have been falling share of GDP, and the rich have been grabbing all of the benefits. If we accept the latest empirical research, which correctly describes human beings, cooperation is the cause of our prosperity, and not self-interest. This is the gospel of selfishness which forms the ideological cornerstone of neoliberal economics, and it has produced harmful economic policies.

The video discusses the idea that market capitalism is an evolutionary system in which prosperity emerges through a positive feedback loop between increasing amounts of innovation and increasing amounts of consumer demand. The new economics suggests just five rules of thumb for building a more sustainable, more prosperous and more equitable society, including insisting that the purpose of the corporation is to improve the welfare of all stakeholders.

Nick Hanauer explains that the economic system is a choice, and that if people want a more equitable and sustainable economy, they only need to choose to have it. He cites the success of the 15-dollar minimum wage and other progressive policies as evidence that changing the economic system can work.
