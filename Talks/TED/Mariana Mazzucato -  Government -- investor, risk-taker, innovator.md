# Summary of Mariana Mazzucato: Government -- investor, risk-taker, innovator

Economist Mariana Mazzucato challenges the notion that the private sector is solely responsible for driving innovation and growth in the economy, arguing that the role of the state is crucial. She points out that the state has played a critical role in funding public goods, supporting risky ventures, providing financial backing for research, and acting as a venture capitalist for high-risk projects that take longer to succeed. Mazzucato believes that public-private partnerships require entrepreneurial state organizations that can take risks and encourage out-of-the-box thinking. She also suggests that the state should consider retaining equity in investments to generate a more direct return to fund green technologies and create broader, more inclusive growth in the economy.

In this section, economist Mariana Mazzucato explores the question of why innovative companies like Apple, Google, and Facebook seem to only emerge from the United States. While many attribute it to the private sector's ability to foster innovation, Mazzucato argues that the role of the state is crucial to successful innovation. She criticizes the common narrative that the private sector is more dynamic and innovative than the public sector, and explains that the state has played a pivotal role in funding public goods and providing financial support for risky ventures in the Silicon Valley growth model. Mazzucato challenges the idea that the public sector has no room for innovation and warns against the dangers of cutting back on public services and funding, which are often outsourced because of this mistaken juxtaposition.

In this section, Mariana Mazzucato highlights the pivotal role played by the government in pioneering most revolutionary breakthroughs in various sectors. From the iPhone technology, which involved significant government-backed research, to the development of groundbreaking medicines, which are predominantly funded in the public sector, she debunked the myth that innovation is solely driven by the private sector. Mazzucato emphasized that the government's role goes beyond fixing market failures to creating and shaping markets, funding basic and applied research, and acting as a venture capitalist for high-risk projects that take longer to produce successful results compared to private investors' expectations. The TED speaker suggested that public-private partnerships require entrepreneurial state organizations that can welcome failure and think out of the box, and thus creating an accurate depiction of the government as a dynamic partner in driving innovation.

In this section, the speaker argues that the state should be considered a risk-taker and innovator, not just a market fixer or regulator. However, the reward for the state of taking on these massive risks, such as the creation of the Internet, has not been sufficient, as the tax revenue earned from the companies that benefit from state-funded innovation is often not enough to compensate. Therefore, the state should consider retaining equity in these investments, as countries such as Finland, China, and Brazil are doing, to generate a more direct return. This could fund green technologies and create broader, more inclusive growth in the economy.
