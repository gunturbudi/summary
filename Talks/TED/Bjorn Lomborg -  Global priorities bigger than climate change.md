# Summary of Bjorn Lomborg: Global priorities bigger than climate change

Bjorn Lomborg, a Danish economist, argues that climate change is not the most important global issue. He suggests that there are more pressing priorities, such as malnutrition and diseases, and that a process called the Copenhagen Consensus can help identify these priorities.

The Copenhagen Consensus is a project aimed at helping policymakers make informed decisions about the most important problems in the world. The project brings together 30 of the world's top economists to provide estimates for the cost of various solutions to these problems. Among the items on the list are climate change, communicable diseases, financial instability, malnutrition and hunger, population migration, sanitation and water, and subsidies and trade barriers. The goal is to help policymakers make informed decisions about what to prioritize.

The video provides an overview of global priorities, including climate change, communicable diseases, and malnutrition. The economists who came up with these priorities claimed that global warming is a bad deal because it is very inefficient and would cost 150 billion dollars a year, while free trade could increase global GDP by 2,400 billion dollars a year. The second best priority is to focus on malnutrition and address the lack of micronutrients. The third best priority is to focus on free trade.
