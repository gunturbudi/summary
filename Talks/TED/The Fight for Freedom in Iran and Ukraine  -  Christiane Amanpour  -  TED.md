In this section, Christiane Amanpour discusses the women's rights revolution happening in Iran following the death of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian woman who died in custody after being arrested for not wearing a hijab. Amanpour, who spent the first 20 years of her life in Iran, describes the history of women's clothing in the country, highlighting the initial demonstrations against the veil during the Islamic Revolution of 1979 and the subsequent tug-of-war between more and less draconian interpretations of enforcing hijab. With the recent election of hardline conservative Ebrahim Raisi, Amanpour notes that it is women who are paying the ultimate price.

In this section, CNN journalist Christiane Amanpour discusses the brutal treatment of protesters, particularly young girls and children, in Iran. While reports of a potential mass execution have been debunked, thousands have still been detained and punished. Male voices within the Islamic establishment are beginning to question the extreme reactions against girls wearing headscarves, but Amanpour is hesitant to predict the outcome of the protests as the regime has proven willing to go to extreme lengths to stay in power. Amanpour suggests that there needs to be more regular reporting on foreign policy stories to keep the American public and editors informed of what is happening in other parts of the world.

She believes that it is important to provide moral support to the Iranian people who are leading the movement, but believes that foreign government involvement would do more harm than good. Amanpour also expresses her disappointment at the world's asylum and refugee policies, which she believes have become draconian and are going far from being what they were originally intended to be.

Despite this, Amanpour is overwhelmed by the spirit of the Ukrainian people who are fighting for independence, sovereignty, and democracy.
