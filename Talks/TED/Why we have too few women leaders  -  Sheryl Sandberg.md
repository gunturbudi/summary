In this section, Sandberg discusses how women tend to systematically underestimate their abilities and negotiate less for salaries compared to men. Men attribute their success to themselves, while women tend to attribute it to external factors. The speaker states that women’s likeability is negatively correlated with their success, which is not the case for men. Sandberg suggests that we need to encourage women to own their successes and negotiate for themselves while being aware of the sacrifices they will make in a world where men do not have to make such trade-offs. The talk concludes with a story about a woman who learned to keep her hand up even if men were still asking questions, highlighting how we need to be vigilant as managers and colleagues to ensure women have equal opportunities.
