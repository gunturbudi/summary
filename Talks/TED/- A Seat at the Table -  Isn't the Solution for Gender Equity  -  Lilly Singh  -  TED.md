# Summary of "A Seat at the Table" Isn't the Solution for Gender Equity | Lilly Singh | TED

In her TED talk, Lilly Singh discusses her personal experiences and challenges as a woman in the entertainment industry. She emphasizes that while the desire for women to have a seat at the table is important, the table was never built for women in the first place. Singh suggests building better tables and creating more seats for women, rather than making them compete for the few spots available. She also stresses the importance of valuing potential over proof and investing in cultural change to create a world where future generations of girls can thrive. Ultimately, Singh calls for a world where women are not simply grateful to sit at the table, but are paid to be there and contribute to diverse, profitable teams and executive boards.
