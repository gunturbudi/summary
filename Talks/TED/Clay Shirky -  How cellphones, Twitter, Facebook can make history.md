In this section, the speaker discusses the transformed media landscape and how it can benefit anyone who wants to spread their message. He talks about how citizens used their phones to take photos and videos during the last presidential election to document the polling places for any kind of voter suppression that may occur. He emphasizes that these tools become socially interesting only when they are technologically boring and when they are taken for granted by everyone. The speaker also talks about the asymmetry of media, where some media is good at creating conversations, while others are good at creating groups but not conversations. He emphasizes that the Internet is the first medium in history that has native support for groups and conversations at the same time, making it natively good at supporting these kinds of conversations.

In this section, the speaker discusses the impact of social media on the media landscape, with examples from China's 2008 earthquake. The earthquake was reported in real-time by citizens using their phones and social media platforms, providing global access to information during the event. Additionally, citizens revealed information about the reason behind the high number of school building collapses - corrupt officials who accepted bribes. This citizen reporting led to protests, but eventually, the Chinese government cracked down on the media and protesters, as they were unable to filter out the abundance of locally-produced, amateur content.

In this section, the speaker discusses the impact of amateur media and social networks on traditional media and message dissemination. The network has grown to include more amateurs than professionals, and organizations sending messages must adapt to a landscape of dialogue and interaction with their audiences. The speaker cites the example of the Obama campaign, who put up MyBarackObama.com, and the ensuing conversation and public backlash when Obama changed his stance on FISA. Obama's campaign team allowed the conversation to continue and acknowledged their role in convening their supporters rather than controlling them. The landscape of media where professionals broadcast messages to amateurs is changing, with media now being global, social, ubiquitous, and cheap, and the former audience now being active participants.
