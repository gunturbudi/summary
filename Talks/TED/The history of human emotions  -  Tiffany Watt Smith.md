# Summary of The history of human emotions | Tiffany Watt Smith

Tiffany Watt Smith challenges the simplistic characterization of emotions into basic feelings by exploring the complex and nuanced nature of how they are experienced and expressed. Emotions can vary in intensity, duration, and cultural specificity, and can defy easy description or translation. They are also shaped by language, concepts, and historical and cultural context, which reveal how they are constructed and shared by individuals and communities. Emotions also vary across time and place, and emotional intelligence requires an understanding of the social, political, and cultural forces that shape our emotions. By learning new and unusual words for emotions, we can gain a deeper understanding of our inner lives' subtleties.

In this section, Tiffany Watt Smith challenges the idea that emotions can be reduced to a handful of basic feelings like joy, anger, fear, disgust, surprise and sadness. She explores how emotions are complex, fluid and hard to define because they vary in intensity, duration and context. Furthermore, emotions can be ambiguous and culturally specific, and sometimes defy easy description or translation. For example, there are emotions like hlwy and gezelligheid that can't be neatly captured by a single term in English, and there are also emotions that evoke contradictory or paradoxical responses, like ilinx and accidie. While emotions can be studied as a biological and psychological phenomenon, they can also be illuminated by history, culture and language, which reveal how feelings are constructed, experienced and shared by individuals and communities.

In this section, the speaker explores the idea of emotions being shaped not only by our bodies but by our thoughts, concepts, and language, as well as cultural expectations and religious beliefs. They discuss how emotions can change and drastically in response to these factors. As an example, the speaker tells the story of nostalgia and its transformation from a severe illness that could kill people to a more minor feeling of missing home. The changing cultural values and celebrations of restlessness and travel might be one reason why homesickness is not felt as acutely as before, affecting how we feel about our emotions. Understanding the historical changes that influence our emotions is crucial to truly being emotionally intelligent.

In this section, Tiffany Watt Smith discusses how emotions vary across time and place. She provides examples from history to underline how sadness used to be viewed as a skill that one should cultivate, and feeling it was encouraged rather than discouraged. Furthermore, she mentions the Baining people's concept of awumbuk, which is a feeling of lethargy that descends when a houseguest finally leaves, and the Japanese word amae, which one can translate as the pleasure that individuals get when they're able to temporarily hand over responsibility for their lives to someone else. Tiffany suggests that emotional intelligence requires an understanding of the social, political, and cultural forces that have shaped our emotions and that by learning new and unusual words for emotions, we can better understand our inner lives' finer aspects. Finally, she ends with an emotion she often experiences when working as a historian – 'dépaysement,' which is the feeling of disorientation in an unfamiliar place.
