# Summary of Thomas Insel: Toward a new understanding of mental illness

In his talk, "Toward a new understanding of mental illness," Thomas Insel discusses the need to rethink mental illness as a brain disorder instead of just a disease of the mind or behavior. Mental disorders are highly prevalent and are the primary cause of 30% of all disability from medical causes because they can become disabling and typically start early in life. Insel emphasizes the importance of early detection and intervention in brain disorders, citing a study of children with very early onset schizophrenia that found a profound loss of gray matter in certain brain areas before any behavioral symptoms emerged. He believes that we are beginning to identify the connectional differences of individuals who have these disorders through the human connectome, which serves as a wiring diagram of the brain.

In this section of the talk, Thomas Insel explains how biomedical research has dramatically improved the outcomes for many serious diseases. Leukemia, heart disease and AIDS have all seen a significant reduction in mortality, while stroke patients who can get to the hospital within three hours have a much better chance of leaving with no disability. Sadly, one area where progress has not been made is suicide, which is the third most common cause of death for 15-to-25-year-olds, with 38,000 Americans taking their own lives each year. Ninety percent of suicides are related to a mental illness, with depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia being among the main contributors. In fact, mental disorders are the primary cause of 30 percent of all disability from medical causes. This is because these disorders are highly prevalent, can become disabling, and typically start early in life.

In this section, Thomas Insel discusses the need to rethink mental illness as a brain disorder rather than just a disease of the mind or behavior. He explains that despite the complexity of the brain, we are beginning to identify the connectional differences of individuals who have these disorders through the human connectome, which serves as a wiring diagram of the brain. In particular, he focuses on schizophrenia as a good case for understanding why thinking of mental disorders as brain disorders matters.

In this section, Thomas Insel discusses a study conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health on children with very early onset schizophrenia. The study found that there was a profound loss of gray matter in areas like the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or the superior temporal gyrus that could be observed long before the first behavioral symptoms of the disease emerged. Insel believes that this study highlights the importance of early detection and intervention in brain disorders, as waiting until the behavior becomes manifest is not early intervention. Insel acknowledges that we are not yet ready to detect these changes, but he believes that it will happen within the next few years.
