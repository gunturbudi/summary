# Summary of Elaine Morgan says we evolved from aquatic apes

Elaine Morgan discusses the theory that humans evolved from aquatic apes, as hypothesized by Alister Hardy in 1960. Morgan argues that evidence such as naked skin, bipedalism, and a fat layer under the skin supports this hypothesis, and suggests that people's resistance to it may be due to an unwritten taboo in the scientific community. She calls for a new synthesis of Darwin's and Hardy's ideas and encourages scientists to challenge the scientific establishment.

In this section, Elaine Morgan addresses the question of why humans are so different from chimpanzees despite being genetically closely related. The traditional explanation was that humans evolved from apes who made the transition from trees to savannas, a scenario that has since been challenged by the paleontologists. The earliest human ancestors were tree dwellers who lived in a non-savanna ecosystem, making it difficult to explain the evolution of humans as naked bipeds. The scientific community's failure to address this puzzle is partly due to the paradigm shift that unsettled the foundation of previous theories, rendering them inadequate. However, the absence of a satisfactory explanation should not stop scientists from pursuing the truth.

In this section of the video, Elaine Morgan discusses the idea that humans evolved from aquatic apes as hypothesized by Alister Hardy in 1960. Morgan argues that the fact that humans have naked skin, walk on two legs in water, and have a fat layer under the skin as aquatic mammals do supports this hypothesis. Additionally, she suggests that the ability to speak may also be linked to an aquatic lifestyle. While her ideas were previously ridiculed, Morgan believes that they hold significant merit and could potentially revolutionize our understanding of human evolution.

In this section, Elaine Morgan highlights the fact that the ability to control breath was necessary for the evolution of humans’ speech and that the fact that we are more streamlined as animals makes us halfway to being a fish. Morgan suggests that for over 40 years, the aquatic theory has been deemed lunatic fringe, with people resistant to it not because they have an alternative theory, but because they were trying to protect a vacuum. Morgan argues that the theory should not be discounted simply because many people believe it to be false. She calls for a new synthesis, where Hardy’s ideas and Darwin’s ideas can be blended together.

In this section, Elaine Morgan discusses the resistance of the scientific establishment to the idea that humans evolved from aquatic apes. Despite evidence supporting the idea and its potential to explain aspects of human evolution such as bipedalism and hairlessness, academics and journals have refused to consider it. Morgan suggests there may be an unwritten rule within the scientific community that it is taboo to believe in the aquatic theory, and that this has turned science into a kind of priesthood. However, Morgan finds solace in Richard Dawkins’ advice to never give excessive reverence to the scientific establishment and not be afraid to challenge it.
