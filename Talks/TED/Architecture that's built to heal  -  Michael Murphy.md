# Summary of Architecture that's built to heal | Michael Murphy

Architect Michael Murphy believes that buildings should promote healing, which is why he designs locally fabricated, or "lo-fab," structures that prioritize natural ventilation and consider the local context, and encourages other architects to ask themselves what more architecture can do. His projects in countries such as Rwanda, Haiti, Malawi, and the US Rust Belt have stimulated economic growth, revitalized communities, and reduced maternal and infant mortality. Murphy also designed the national memorial to lynching victims in Montgomery, Alabama, as a place for restorative justice and spiritual healing, emphasizing the importance of architecture reflecting individual and societal values.

He then shares his experience designing and building a hospital in Rwanda with a team that prioritized natural ventilation, patients' views of nature, and site-specific designs.

He cites examples of projects in Rwanda, Haiti, Malawi, the Congo and Rust Belt cities in the US where lo-fab architecture helped stimulate economic growth, protect endangered wildlife, reduce maternal and infant mortality, and revitalize communities. Murphy believes that lo-fab architecture can be replicated globally and transform communities, and he encourages architects to ask themselves, “What more can architecture do?”

In this section, Michael Murphy, an architect, shares about his involvement in designing a national memorial to the victims of lynching in Montgomery, Alabama, in collaboration with Bryan Stevenson and his team. The monument takes visitors on a journey through a familiar classical building type, which shifts visitors' perceptions as they begin to understand the vast number of those who have yet to be put to rest. Temporary columns outside the memorial will eventually be placed in the counties where these lynchings have occurred. The act of collecting soil from where these killings took place has led to restorative justice and spiritual healing, and the monument will be a place to speak of the unspeakable acts that have scarred this nation.
