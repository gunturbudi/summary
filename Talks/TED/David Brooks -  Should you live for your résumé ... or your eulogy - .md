In this section, David Brooks discusses the difference between the résumé virtues and the eulogy virtues. He explains that Adam I is the worldly, ambitious, and external side of our nature, while Adam II is the more humble and internal side, wanting not only to do good but to be good. Soloveitchik argued that these two sides of our nature are at war with each other, with society often neglecting Adam II, causing people to neglect the more important eulogy virtues. He suggests that individuals must go back into their own past to identify personal issues, such as sins and weaknesses to build depth of character.
