# Summary of The four fish we're overeating -- and what to eat instead | Paul Greenberg

Paul Greenberg discusses how the seafood market has been reduced to four main creatures: shrimp, tuna, salmon, and cod. Overfishing has been a problem for the last 50 years, with the technology developed during World War II redirected towards fish and a significant increase in fishing capacity. Shrimp, the most consumed seafood in America, is a terrible product as five to 15 pounds of wild fish are killed to bring one pound to the market. Tuna and salmon, the next two most consumed seafood in America and throughout the West, are also problematic, with vast amounts of small fish being killed to produce them. The McDonald's Filet-O-Fish sandwich started as a halibut sandwich before being changed to a less expensive fish, Alaska pollock. Tilapia, clupeids, bivalves, and seaweed are suggested as potential replacements for these overfished species that are more sustainable. Greenberg emphasizes the need to scale up aquacultured fish production for a sustainable future.

In this section, Paul Greenberg discusses how the seafood market has been reduced to four main creatures: shrimp, tuna, salmon, and cod. This phenomenon is not new, as humans tend to reduce the natural world to very few elements, just like the four mammals and birds that became the norm in modern animal husbandry. Overfishing has been a problem for the last 50 years, with the technology developed during World War II redirected towards fish and a significant increase in fishing capacity. Add this to the boom in fish farming and aquaculture, which now exceeds the amount of wild fish produced. Furthermore, Greenberg talks about how shrimp, the most consumed seafood in America, is a terrible product as 5 to 15 pounds of wild fish are killed to bring one pound of shrimp to the market. The farming of shrimp is also problematic as it usually takes place in mangrove forests, which are necessary to protect coasts and provide habitats for young fish and shrimp, and are being destroyed at an alarming rate.

In this section, the speaker discusses the next two most consumed seafood in America and throughout the West, which are tuna and salmon. Tunas are difficult to manage or farm because they are huge and warm-blooded creatures that can swim over 40 miles per hour. On the other hand, salmon used to be available wild but now farmed in large quantities. Aquaculture is the fastest-growing food system on the planet, growing at 7% per year. However, vast amounts of small fish are being killed to produce them. The last type of seafood discussed is called “whitefish,” where many fish are cycled into this category. The speaker uses McDonald’s Filet-O-Fish sandwich as an example of “whitefish,” which started as a halibut sandwich before being changed to a less expensive fish.

In this section, the speaker explains how the Filet-O-Fish sandwich at McDonald's ended up being made from Alaska pollock, the largest fin fish fishery in the United States that takes 2-3 billion pounds of fish out of the sea every year. Tilapia is suggested as a potential replacement, given they are sustainable fish that convert plant protein into animal protein efficiently, but they lack an oily fish profile rich in EPA and DHA. The possibility of eating clupeids instead of feeding them to salmon is also raised, or even looking into bivalves like mussels that are high in EPA and DHA and filter water efficiently. Lastly, seaweed is discussed as a good source of protein that filters water and doesn't require watering, and the need to scale up aquacultured fish production for a more sustainable future.
