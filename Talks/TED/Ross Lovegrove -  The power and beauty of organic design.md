# Summary of Ross Lovegrove: The power and beauty of organic design

Ross Lovegrove discusses his philosophy of creating intelligent and intuitive form that elevates people's understanding and appreciation of products derived from resources extracted from the earth, emphasizing that creating artificial consumerism is not his interest. He draws inspiration from natural growth patterns and organic forms, using an innovative approach with biopolymers and natural materials in his design process. He showcases his unique artistic process and the influence of natural phenomena on his designs, with examples such as diatomic structures, radiolaria prints, an organic polymer chair, and futuristic water droplet car designs. He stresses the need for instinct and collaboration in design.

In this section, Lovegrove discusses his philosophy of creating intelligent and intuitive form that elevates people's understanding and appreciation of products that are translated from resources extracted from the earth. He emphasizes that creating artificial consumerism is not his interest and instead advocates for designing packaging to emphasize and respect the products. Lovegrove talks about how he reinvented his process of designing by creating digitally machined products such as 'water bottle' which he refers to as an 'icon of water' that touches peoples' emotions and is different from other bottles as aesthetically, and practically it is different and elevates peoples' perception of contemporary design. Lovegrove also talks about biopolymers and how they will come into play in probably a decade.

In this section, Ross Lovegrove discusses the inspiration he draws from natural growth patterns and organic forms. He expresses fascination with the complex shapes that evolve over hundreds of millions of years and how that can be applied to his design process. Lovegrove uses an innovative approach with biopolymers and natural materials in his design process. He believes observation of these natural processes and how they adapt can be brought into the design process every day, resulting in a powerfully holistic and essential design.

In this section, Ross Lovegrove showcases his unique artistic process and the influence of natural phenomena on his designs. He highlights his new portfolio featuring prints of diatomic structures and radiolaria while explaining his dedication to using minimal materials, cored out of silica and coral, which eliminates waste and "deliver maximum beauty." Lovegrove's latest work includes an organic, gas-injected polymer chair with filtered-down diatomic structures embodying the flow of polymer, and futuristic, no-engine water droplet car designs with solar panels, batteries in the wheels, and an adjustable proboscis adapted for both driving and as a street lamp.

In this section, Ross Lovegrove showcases his studio and some of his works, which include a $250,000 stereolithography staircase, a bio-polycarbonate chair named Plasnet, and the world's first solar-powered garden lamp on top of the concept structure called Solar Seed. He also talks about his elephant skull from Oxford University, a copper jelly mold, and his book called "Supernatural." Lovegrove stresses the need for instinct and collaboration in design.
