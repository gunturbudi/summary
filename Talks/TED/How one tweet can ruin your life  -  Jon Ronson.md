In this section, the speaker talks about how Twitter became a tool for social justice and accountability, but soon after, people started to abuse it. He shares the example of Jonah Lehrer, a disgraced pop science writer who was caught plagiarizing and faking quotes. He was supposed to apologize publicly to regain some dignity back but was met with a giant screen Twitter feed right next to his head, where people were calling him a "sociopath" and "boring." The speaker then tells the story of Justine Sacco, a PR woman who tweeted a joke about AIDS that went viral and ruined her life.

In this section, Jon Ronson discusses the dangers of social media and how it can ruin one's life through the story of Justine Sacco. Ronson highlights that on social media, people surround themselves with like-minded individuals, and they only entangle with them. That creates a mutual approval machine. People's desire to be seen as compassionate is what led to the profoundly un-compassionate act against Sacco. Ronson argues that the concept of "misuse of privilege" is becoming a free pass to tear anyone apart, regardless of whether the act was serious or not. This situation leads to a devaluation of the term and weakens our capacity for empathy. Ronson raises the point that there are two types of people in the world: those who favor humans over ideology and those who favor ideology over humans.
