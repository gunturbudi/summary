Leymah Gbowee tells the story of her experiences as a single mother of four in Liberia, as well as her work with girls' education in the early 2000s. In 1998, she was given the opportunity to work as a research assistant in a village, and she was able to take one of the village's girls with her. Wei, who had been the laughingstock of the community due to her father's absence and her mother's treatment of her, became Gbowee's companion and helped her to buy clothes and a doll for herself. Gbowee later returned to the village after it was invaded by rebels and was able to find and save Wei and another girl. In 2010, Gbowee testified before the president of Liberia about the challenges the girls in her village still faced, and she was awarded a full scholarship to attend college.
