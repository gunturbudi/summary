# Summary of Christopher deCharms: A look inside the brain in real time

Christopher deCharms discusses the potential of non-invasive MRI technology that allows researchers to see brain patterns in real time, enabling individuals to control their thoughts, emotions, and chronic pain. This technology creates a fourth alternative to impacting the brain, distinct from therapy, pills, and surgery. Chronic pain patients have seen a reduction of 44 to 64 percent through investigational technology. The implications of the technology remain unknown, but experts are excited about the possibilities of the human mind and what aspects will be controllable in the future.

In this section, Christopher deCharms discusses the possibility of looking inside the human brain using non-invasive MRI technology that allows researchers to see brain patterns in real time. By analyzing these patterns, individuals can learn how to control them and impact their thoughts, emotions, and chronic pain. This is significant because it creates a fourth alternative to impacting the brain, which includes therapy, pills, and surgery. Researchers have seen a 44 to 64 percent decrease in chronic pain patients using this investigational technology. The question now is where this technology will go and what aspects of the human mind and brain we will be able to control.
