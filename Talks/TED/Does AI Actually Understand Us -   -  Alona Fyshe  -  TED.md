# Summary of Does AI Actually Understand Us? | Alona Fyshe | TED

Alona Fyshe, in her TED Talk, questions whether AI can truly understand humans or not. She draws upon the Chinese room argument and neural networks to emphasize that just because AI can respond to questions, it doesn't necessarily mean that it understands language like humans do. Though AI has a scratch pad similar to the human brain, the underlying correlations between the neural network scratchpad and the brain scratchpad are weak. It is important to understand the limitations of AI and examine how it processes language to understand what's happening.

In this section, the speaker talks about whether AI actually understands humans or if it's just an imposter. She references the Chinese room argument, which argues that just because a person can respond in a foreign language using a set of instructions, it doesn't mean they actually understand the language. Similarly, even if AI can generate plausible dialogue and answer questions, it may still not truly understand language like humans do. To determine whether it's an imposter or not, we need to see what's going on "under the hood" and compare it to what humans do with language.

In this section, we learn that scientists can take snapshots of the scratch pad in the brain using slow and fuzzy brain imaging techniques like fMRI or EEG as people read words or stories. These snapshots tell scientists a little bit about how brains process and represent information while reading. Similarly, artificial intelligence (AI) has a scratch pad in the form of neural networks which process numbers that represent language. It turns out that 75% of the time, the predicted AI neural network scratchpad is more similar to the true scratch pad than another random word. However, scientists remind us that AI cannot truly understand language like humans do because neural networks have not experienced the world like us. Moreover, the underlying correlations between the neural network scratchpad and the brain scratchpad are still pretty weak, making AI experiments still a long way from human comprehension.

In this section, Alona Fyshe emphasizes the importance of understanding the limitations of AI when it comes to interpreting human language. As meaning-making beings, humans are adept at interpreting and deriving meaning from language using context and prior knowledge. However, AI can be easily fooled if we only focus on its input and output. To truly understand what's happening, we need to look inside the metaphorical room of AI and examine how it processes language.
