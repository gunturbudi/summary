# Summary of Anthony Atala: Growing new organs

Dr. Anthony Atala explores the challenges surrounding organ transplantation and the potential of stem cells and biomaterials to regenerate organs for transplant. His team has successfully engineered organs, such as the bladder, using a patient's own cells and scaffold materials designed to disintegrate after regeneration. However, larger organs such as the heart and liver require stem cells for successful regeneration. Dr. Atala emphasizes the importance of testing these technologies in the lab before implementation, with the ultimate goal of improving patients' quality of life.

In this section of the video, Anthony Atala discusses the challenges that come with organ transplantation and the shortage of organs available for transplants. He explains that stem cells could be a possible solution, but getting them into patients for actual therapies for organs is a challenge. Atala then goes on to explain how the body's natural ability to regenerate can be harnessed using smart biomaterials as a bridge. He provides an example of a patient with an injured urethra, where a smart biomaterial was used to create a bridge for cells to cross and regenerate the urethra. However, the maximum efficient distance for regeneration is only about one centimeter, so while this is a promising approach, it has limitations.

In this section of the video, Dr. Atala explains how cells can be used to regenerate organs for larger injuries. Using patient cells, small pieces of diseased or injured organs are taken and the cells are grown and expanded outside of the body in large quantities. Scaffold materials are then used as a cell delivery vehicle. These materials, designed to disintegrate after a few months, allow cells to regenerate new tissue before the scaffold disappears. This method has been used to regenerate larger organs such as the bladder, engineered blood vessels, and heart valves. The organs are exercised before implantation, allowing them to function on demand.

In this section, Dr. Anthony Atala discusses the different strategies his team uses to engineer complex organs, including solid organs and highly vascularized ones such as the heart, liver, and kidneys. One strategy involves using smart biomaterials to regenerate organs while the other involves using a patient's own cells that will not be rejected. Additionally, his team can obtain cells from most of the organs in the human body except for heart, liver, nerve, and pancreas for which they still need stem cells. The team has had some success with decellularized organs, perfusing vascular trees with patients' own cells, and creating miniature kidneys that actually make urine.

In this section, Dr. Anthony Atala discusses the challenges of regenerative medicine and the importance of thoroughly testing these technologies in the laboratory before launching them to patients. He shares a short clip of a young woman who had received an engineered bladder and was able to lead a healthy, normal life after the operation. Dr. Atala emphasizes that the ultimate goal of regenerative medicine is to make patients better and the importance of doing no harm.
