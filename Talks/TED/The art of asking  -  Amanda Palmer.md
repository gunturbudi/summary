# Summary of The art of asking | Amanda Palmer

Amanda Palmer, a living statue turned musician, talks about her experiences with artful asking, which involves making a connection with people and asking for help. She discusses the similarities between couchsurfing and crowdsurfing and how asking for help makes some people feel vulnerable, but that people want to help when they feel connected. She shares how giving away her music for free and encouraging people to share it resulted in a successful crowdfunding campaign, and she highlights the importance of trust and fearlessness in building a community on the Internet. She argues that we should be asking "How do we let people pay for music?" instead of "How do we make people pay for music?"

In this section, Amanda Palmer explains how she used to make a living as a self-employed living statue on the street. She recalls the intense eye contact and the profound encounters she had while standing on a box painted in white and handing people who dropped money a flower. Even though people would sometimes harass her, making her think what she was doing was somehow un-joblike or unfair, the income was consistent and, more importantly, she made a direct connection with people. Later on, when she became a touring musician, she made an art out of asking people to help and join, which expanded with Twitter and became more magical because she could ask for anything anywhere and she loved this kind of random closeness.

In this section, Amanda Palmer shares her experiences of couchsurfing and crowdsurfing, two activities that she believes are essentially the same. She argues that they both involve falling into the audience and trusting each other; as examples, she tells stories of couchsurfing in a variety of locations around the world and of asking her opening band to pass around the hat for extra money. She acknowledges that some people find asking difficult because it makes them feel vulnerable, but she maintains that people want to help when they feel connected to each other. She learned this through giving away her music online for free and encouraging people to share it, even though the music industry considered such behavior unacceptable. As a result, she turned to crowdfunding for her next project, and it was a resounding success, raising nearly $1.2 million.

In this section, Amanda Palmer discusses the criticism she received for continuing her crowdsourcing practices, despite the immense success of her Kickstarter campaign. She highlights the alienation between artists and their communities caused by the celebrity culture, and explains how she trusts her fans to help her in unconventional ways, such as letting them draw on her or inviting them to join her on stage. Palmer emphasizes the importance of trust and fearlessness in building a community on the Internet, rather than solely focusing on monetary transactions. She argues that, rather than asking "How do we make people pay for music?", we should be asking "How do we let people pay for music?"
