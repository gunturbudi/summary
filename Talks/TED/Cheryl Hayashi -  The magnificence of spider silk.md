Spider silk is a long, repetitive protein and it is mostly composed of glycine and alanine. Individual spider silks can have dramatically different repeat sequences, and silk properties such as strength and extensibility can be quantified using methods such as tensile testing. Dragline silk is the strongest of all spider silks, and is used for the frame and radii of a web. Flagelliform silk is the most stretchy and is used for capturing prey.
