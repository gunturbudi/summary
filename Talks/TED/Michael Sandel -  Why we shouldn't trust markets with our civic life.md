# Summary of Michael Sandel: Why we shouldn't trust markets with our civic life

In this video, Michael Sandel discusses the dangers of the "marketization" of society, where market mechanisms and values are applied to non-material goods like education and civic life. He argues that this can exacerbate inequality and hollow out public discourse, and calls for a public debate on the value and meaning of these social practices. Sandel also questions the use of cash incentives in schools, as they may crowd out intrinsic motivation and corrupt the values that children should learn. He ends by asking whether there are certain moral and civic goods that money cannot buy, and whether we want a society where everything is up for sale.

In this section, the speaker shares various real-life examples of the marketization of societal goods through market mechanisms, including buying prison cell upgrades, paying for fast track or VIP theme park tickets and lobbyist line-standing services, using private military contractors, and more. The speaker argues that this transition from a market economy to a market society is concerning because it exacerbates inequality by reinforcing the power of wealth, and it risks diminishing the intrinsic values and norms of society in the face of market values.

In this section, Michael Sandel discusses the use of market mechanisms in schools to incentivize children from disadvantaged backgrounds to study hard, do well in school, and to apply themselves. Some economists have proposed offering cash incentives to kids for getting good grades, high test scores, or for reading books. Sandel asks the audience whether they think it's worth a try, with some in favor and others opposed. Those against it believe that cash incentives might take away the intrinsic motivation to learn and read, and the risk of crowding out the love for learning cannot be overlooked. Even though economists assume markets are inert and do not touch or taint goods, some believe that market exchange can potentially drive out higher motivations and corrupt the intrinsic lessons that children should learn, which is to read and learn to love to learn for their own sakes.

In this section, Michael Sandel argues that while markets and cash incentives may work for material goods, when it comes to non-material goods like teaching and learning or civic life, they may undermine or crowd out nonmarket values and attitudes worth caring about. He calls for a public debate on the value and meaning of these social practices while warning that market reasoning and market thinking have hollowed out public discourse in the past three decades. Marketizing every aspect of life leads to a condition where the affluent and those of modest means live separate lives and encounter one another less often. This is not good for democracy and is unsatisfying for those who can afford it, Sandel argues. He ends by asking whether we want a society where everything is up for sale or whether there are certain moral and civic goods that markets do not honor and money cannot buy.
