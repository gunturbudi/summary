# Summary of Jared Diamond: How societies can grow old better

Jared Diamond discusses the treatment of elderly citizens in traditional and modern societies. In traditional societies, older people are often cared for and live with their families, leading to greater happiness and quality of life. Diamond explains that the treatment of elderly people in traditional societies is largely dependent on their usefulness and society's values. Modern society has made life worse for elderly people, leading to increased isolation and decreased usefulness due to formal retirement and technological changes. Diamond suggests that society can improve the lives of the elderly by recognizing their value and finding ways to make use of their knowledge and experience. He also notes that traditional societies offer potential advantages over modern ones in their treatment of the elderly.

In this section, Jared Diamond discusses how traditional societies treat their elderly citizens, with a particular focus on the treatment of older people in comparison to modern societies. Diamond explains that in many traditional societies, older people live amongst their children and relatives and are cared for and fed, leading to greater happiness and quality of life. However, Diamond also explains that treatment of older people varies widely among traditional societies, and that some societies get rid of their elderly in cruel ways due to particularly harsh conditions. The usefulness of older people, as well as society's values, are the two main contributors to how they are treated in traditional societies.

In this section, the speaker discusses the usefulness of older people in traditional societies, including their ability to produce food, babysit grandchildren, make tools and textiles, and possess knowledge and skills valuable to survival. He then contrasts the high respect given to older people in East Asian cultures with the low status of the elderly in the US, where they are disadvantaged in job applications and healthcare resources, due in part to the American emphasis on work, self-reliance, and youth. While there have been positive changes such as longer lives and better health, negative changes include the increasing burden of older people on the fewer younger people, and the breaking of social ties with age.

In this section, Jared Diamond discusses the ways in which modern society has made life worse for elderly people, such as their increased isolation from their families and communities, formal retirement, and decreased usefulness due to the rise of literacy and technological change. He suggests ways in which society can improve the lives of the elderly and make better use of their knowledge and experience, such as encouraging them to offer high-quality childcare as grandparents, recognizing them as valuable reservoirs of experience from living through hard times like the Great Depression and World War II, and finding ways to make use of the things that older people can still do better than younger people.

In this section, Jared Diamond highlights the valuable attributes of both younger and older people, respectively. According to Diamond, younger people are typically better suited for tasks that require physical strength and learning simulations, while older people have more experience, interdisciplinary thinking, and are better equipped to advise, strategize, and teach. Despite this, Diamond notes that traditional societies tend to make better use of their elderly and give them more satisfying lives than modern societies. In contrast to the elderly in traditional societies, who commonly have a rich social life, modern society sees old age as a disaster area, leaving vast amounts of the elderly unhappy and dissatisfied with their lives. Diamond suggests that there may be much to learn from traditional societies, which offer many potential advantages over modern ones.
