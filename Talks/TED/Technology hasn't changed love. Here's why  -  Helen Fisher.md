# Summary of Technology hasn't changed love. Here's why | Helen Fisher

Helen Fisher argues that technology has not fundamentally changed the way humans love, as our brain systems for sexual, romantic, and family relationships have existed for millions of years. Despite the advent of dating sites, people still choose who to love based on natural patterns of mate choice, while women entering the job market has had the most transformative impact on modern relationships. Fisher also discusses how modern dating behaviors have developed, but ultimately concludes that the fundamental desires of trust, respect, physical attraction, and humor remain constant over time.

In this section, the speaker argues that technology hasn't made significant changes to the way humans love, as the brain systems that control our sexual, romantic and family lives have been in place for over 4.4 million years. While technology has brought new ways of courting and introduced new rules, it hasn't altered how humans choose to love or who they love. The speaker also suggests that even dating sites are not changing love, as they are merely introducing sites, and the only algorithm that truly matters is the human brain's ancient ability to choose a mate.

In this section, Helen Fisher discusses how our natural patterns of mate choice are not changed by modern technology. People are drawn to those who have similar personalities, while at other times, opposites attract. With the growing paradox of choice in modern society, Fisher notices a new form of courtship she calls "slow love," which involves taking more time to know all there is to know about a partner before marrying them. She thinks this new trend will result in people having more happy marriages due to the long extension of the pre-commitment stage.

In this section, Helen Fisher explains that, of all the changes that have taken place in modern romance and family life, women entering the job market has had the most significant and transformative impact. Prior to the advent of farming, women had equal status to men in hunter-gatherer societies, but as the demands of domesticity shifted, ancient prejudices towards women became entrenched. Today, society is in flux, shedding traditional beliefs in favor of egalitarian relationships between the sexes. Fisher concludes that love and attachment will always endure and that any understanding of human relationships must consider the unquenchable and primordial human drive to love.

In this section, the speaker discusses how technology has influenced modern dating behaviors. Three tactics, icing, simmering, and ghosting, have developed as stalling tactics and prolong the uncertainty of relationships, while avoiding intimacy-building. The speaker questions whether changes in context alter the nature of love, and whether they influence our needs, but concludes that the fundamental desire for trust, respect, physical attraction, and someone who makes us laugh remains constant over time. The context of what people want changes, but humans have always had alternatives and have evolved to handle and evaluate them.
