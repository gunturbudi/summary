In this section, Bunker Roy shares how he left behind a life of privilege to work in a village during a famine and saw firsthand the skills and knowledge possessed by the world's poor that are never recognized. He then established the Barefoot College, a college exclusively for the poor, where they redefine professionalism as someone who has a combination of competence, confidence, and belief, and focuses on the skills that are relevant today but not recognized in the mainstream. The college shows a path to self-sufficiency to those who are forgotten and creates a new paradigm to solve global issues.

In this section of the video, Bunker Roy explains the unique aspects of the Barefoot College, which is built following the lifestyle and workstyle of Mahatma Gandhi. There are no written contracts, and people come for the work and the challenge rather than the money. The Barefoot College is the only college where the teacher is the learner and the learner is the teacher, and there are no certificates given. The college is fully solar-electrified and the power comes from 45 kilowatts of panels on the roof. The women at the Barefoot College fabricate the most sophisticated solar cooker and all the meals are solar-cooked. Additionally, the college collects rainwater from the roofs and runs a night school for the children.

In this section, Bunker Roy from the Barefoot College in Rajasthan, India, shares some of the innovative approaches they have taken to improve the lives of people in rural communities. They have established solar-lit night schools, held elections for prime ministers, and used puppetry to solve problems in villages. All schools under their organization are solar-lit, and they hold an election among six to 14-year-old children every five years to elect a 12-year-old prime minister who supervises 150 schools for 7,000 children. They also use puppetry as a communication tool since the percentage of illiteracy is significantly high. Additionally, Bunker Roy's team trained grandmothers in Afghanistan, using sign language to become solar engineers over six months, showing their objective to help people by empowering them, not just by installing solar panels.
