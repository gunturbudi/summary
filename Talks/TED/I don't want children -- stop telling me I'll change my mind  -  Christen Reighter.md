# Summary of I don't want children -- stop telling me I'll change my mind | Christen Reighter

Christen Reighter discusses the societal pressure on women to have children and the vilification of those who choose not to.

Reighter highlights the importance of bodily autonomy and making choices based on personal values rather than societal expectations. Ultimately, she underwent a tubal ligation to take control of her own reproductive choices despite facing numerous obstacles and resistance from doctors. She believes that women should have the right to choose motherhood or not, free from the societal pressure to conform to traditional gender roles.
