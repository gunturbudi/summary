# Summary of Are we born to run? | Christopher McDougall

Christopher McDougall presents three mysteries related to human evolution and athleticism: how humans were able to hunt without weapons, women's ability to excel in long-distance running, and the fact that geriatrics can perform as well as they did as teenagers in running. He proposes that humans evolved as hunting pack animals and their unique advantage was sweating and running long distances. McDougall suggests getting rid of cushioned running shoes and returning to more primitive running methods could have benefits for physical and mental health. He discusses the benefits of barefoot running, which include stress and injury reduction, and hopes that everyone can benefit from it.

In this section, Christopher McDougall talks about the extraordinary abilities of runners in peculiar situations. He mentioned Derartu Tulu, an Ethiopian woman who defied the odds and won the New York City Marathon against Paula Radcliffe, the fastest woman marathoner in history. He also talked about the reclusive tribe of Tarahumara Indians, who have been living unchanged for the past 400 years, yet deep into old age, can run even more than marathons without any injury, as well as being free from modern illnesses such as heart disease, cholesterol, cancer, depression, and violent tendencies. Scientists at Harvard and the University of Utah are also studying the tribe to understand their exceptional ability.

In this section, Christopher McDougall explores three mysteries related to human evolution and athleticism. The first mystery is how early humans were able to hunt and kill animals for nearly two million years without any weapons, and without strength or speed. McDougall presents the theory that humans evolved as a pack of hunting dogs with sweating as their unique advantage. The second mystery relates to women's ability to excel in long-distance running despite medical science suggesting they were incapable of it. The third mystery involves the fact that geriatrics can perform as well as they did as teenagers in running, which is uncommon in other sports. According to McDougall, the unique ability of humans to sweat and run long distances could be the missing piece that solves all three mysteries.

In this section, McDougall proposes that humans evolved as hunting pack animals and that their ability to run long distances on a hot day was a major advantage for the hunting pack. He argues that the key to successful hunting is the word "pack," and that the group cannot be materialistic, hold grudges, or bear egos. McDougall believes that cushioned running shoes have made humans worse runners, and that running injuries are a new phenomenon in human history. He suggests that getting rid of running shoes and returning to more primitive running methods could have benefits for physical and mental health.

In this section, Christopher McDougall discusses the benefits of barefoot running, which includes stress and injury reduction. He mentions a growing subculture of barefoot runners who have found that getting rid of shoes makes running a lot more enjoyable. McDougall himself got rid of his shoes in his early 40s and experienced a reduction in running ailments. Ultimately, he hopes that everyone can benefit from barefoot running.
