In this section, Jordan Peterson argues against the modern idea of accepting yourself as you are, stating that it is a nihilistic idea. He explains that to love yourself properly, it is not only necessary to love what you are, but also to love who you could become. Peterson highlights that it can be demoralizing for young people who are struggling psychologically and socially to be told that they are perfect just the way they are. He suggests that a more sophisticated self-love involves directing love towards your future self and encouraging yourself to strive for what is better. Peterson notes that by walking the pathway that makes things better, things immediately become better as your orientation changes, and you start to improve.
