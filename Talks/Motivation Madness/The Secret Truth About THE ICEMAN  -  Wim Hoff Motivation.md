The video discusses the importance of reducing stress, and how doing so by taking a cold shower every day can help to optimize the body's cardiovascular system and reduce stress levels. The video also discusses how reducing stress can help to avoid conditions such as oxidative stress, hormonal stress, and cancer. The video showcases research conducted by 140 top researchers on the DNA of the iceman, or Wim Hoff. The researchers found that by activating positive stress and exercising, the body can protect cells from viruses, bacteria, inflammation, and oxidative stress. They also found that by thinking of a desired outcome and focusing on it, humans are able to achieve it with ease. Finally, the researchers divulge that they are currently training people to achieve the same results.
