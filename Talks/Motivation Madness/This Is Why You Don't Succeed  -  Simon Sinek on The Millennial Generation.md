Simon Sinek discusses the negative impact of technology, particularly smartphones and social media, on the Millennial generation. He points out that addiction to these devices can lead to isolation, suicide, and accidental deaths due to overdoses, among other issues. Sinek also criticizes parents for not taking action to tackle this issue. He argues that Millennials have grown up in an environment of instant gratification that lacks institutionalized patience, leading to a lack of understanding that life and relationships are journeys instead of instant impact, which can cause problems when jumping from job to job. Companies need to prioritize personal growth to prevent these issues as more Millennials enter the workforce. The speaker suggests that children should not be given free access to phones and social media at a young age and that companies should take responsibility for the wellbeing of their employees.

In this section, Simon Sinek talks about the negative impact of technology on our lives. He argues that we have not been considering the right balance of technology and we are living in an age where smartphones and social media have become an addiction with detrimental effects, especially on Millennials. He points out that the chemical dopamine released when we get notifications from our phones can be addictive and make a person go to their device for stress relief instead of the people around them. This can lead to a sense of loneliness and isolation, which we are seeing an increase in, along with suicide rates, accidental deaths due to overdoses, and school shootings among Millennials. He explains how an entire generation is growing up addicted to their devices without learning the skill set to cope with stress and turn to people for help. He also criticizes parents for not taking any action to tackle this issue.
