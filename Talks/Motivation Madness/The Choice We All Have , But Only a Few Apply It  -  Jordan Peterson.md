In this section, Jordan Peterson emphasizes the importance of challenge and the need to embrace responsibility. Peterson argues that humans are built to take on a maximal load which strengthens them, whereas a life without challenge is stultifying. He asserts that humans need to Hoist the Troubles of the world up on their shoulders to be awake and sharp to stop evil from corrupting society. Peterson argues that life is tragedy tainted by malevolence, but despite this, humans can thrive under precisely those conditions, which is the fundamental issue of the judeo-christian ethic with its emphasis on the divinity of the individual. To become an individual, one needs to take on all of that voluntarily to stand up straight by taking on responsibility. The immediate consequence of making that decision is that all the catastrophe justifies itself in the nobility of your striving to be an individual.
