In this section, Jordan Peterson explains that anxiety, depression, and drug/alcohol abuse are all understandable reactions to the tragedy of life, the fact that we're vulnerable, and that we're going to die. However, he argues that the appropriate response to this is to be fully self-conscious, to be aware of your limitations and the dangers you might apprehend, and then to make the decision to move forward into the unknown, despite the fear. He suggests that the secret to a good life is to lay out what you're anxious about in detail, decompose it into small manageable problems, and then expose yourself to the thing you're afraid of, which doesn't necessarily make you less afraid, but rather braver. This voluntary approach is associated with positive emotion and is less hard on you than the defensive posturing system. If you view yourself acting in a courageous and forthright manner, encountering the world, and taking risks, then you have something real to comfort yourself with when you're wondering about the point of your life.
