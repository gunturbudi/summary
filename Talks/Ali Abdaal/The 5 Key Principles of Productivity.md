The five key principles of productivity are capture, clarify, organize, reflect, and engage. These are steps in a process of getting things done. Capture is the act of writing down ideas so that they can be stored and accessed later. Clarify is the process of sorting through and organizing these ideas. Organize is the process of putting these ideas in a hierarchy so that they are easier to access and understand. Reflect is the process of taking these ideas and turning them into actionable goals. Engage is the process of doing what needs to be done in order to achieve these goals.

The five key principles of productivity are capture, clarify, organize, reflect, and engage. These steps are important in order to effectively manage and complete tasks. The first step, capture, is to write down everything that is on your mind in an external system. The second step, clarify, is to make sure each step is specifically defined and has a next action. The third step, organize, is to put tasks in the right places and to keep them organized by priority, deadline, and area of focus. The fourth step, reflect, is to review and review again in order to stay on top of tasks. The fifth and final step, engage, is to actually do the tasks on the list. By following these five steps, you will feel more relieved and productive.
