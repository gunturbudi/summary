In this video, the speaker shares their evidence-based sleep routine, which includes getting 7-8 hours of sleep per night and establishing a consistent sleep and wake time, catching morning sunlight to regulate the body's circadian rhythm, delaying caffeine intake to align with cortisol spikes, and avoiding bright artificial lights in the evening. They also discuss the timing of exercise and caffeine consumption and the importance of keeping the room cool to improve sleep quality. Additionally, they recommend reading to feel sleepy during a naturally occurring spike in wakefulness and positioning warm-colored lamps or candles low in the room for better sleep.

In this section, the speaker outlines the first four evidence-based components of their sleep routine. Firstly, they aim to sleep for 7-8 hours each night because research shows that consistently getting less than 7 hours can lead to negative physical and mental health outcomes. Secondly, the speaker builds a sleep rhythm by setting a consistent sleep and wake time to align with the bodyâ€™s homeostatic sleep drive. They provide four practical tips for building this rhythm, such as setting an alarm for the same time every day and listening to your body. Thirdly, the speaker catches morning sunlight to trigger the release of cortisol and epinephrine, which makes us alert and awake. They explain that light, particularly from the sun, is the key ingredient to regulate our internal circadian rhythm. Finally, the speaker delays their caffeine intake to align with cortisol spikes and chooses to take a walk in the morning to get sunlight and improve their sleep quality.

In this section, the speaker discusses the timing of exercise and caffeine consumption in relation to achieving optimal sleep. While sunlight remains the most essential element, exercise also releases endorphins that elevate one's mood and increase wakefulness. Experts recommend establishing a morning exercise routine to help with energy spikes and sleepiness in the evening. Caffeine, on the other hand, blocks sleep-inducing adenosine receptors; it's advised to avoid consuming caffeine in the afternoon, specifically between 1-3 pm, depending on each person's caffeine tolerance. Moreover, it's essential to avoid bright artificial lights, including devices such as laptops and phones, in the late evening and early morning.

In this section, the speaker explains the importance of avoiding bright lights in the evening because it signals our brains that it is daytime and releases cortisol and epinephrine, keeping us awake. A 2018 study published in a high-quality journal shows that light arriving to the eyes between 11 pm and 4 am suppresses dopamine, leading to lower mood and disappointment over the next few days. To avoid these lights, the speaker uses a dim computer screen and a Kindle on a warm light setting instead of a phone. The positioning of artificial lights can also affect sleep, and warm-colored lamps or candles positioned low can be more effective. Additionally, the speaker aims to feel alert one hour before the natural bedtime and reads to feel sleepy again during this naturally occurring spike in wakefulness. Lastly, the speaker keeps the room cool by setting an air conditioner or using a fan to drop the temperature by 1 to 3 degrees Celsius.
