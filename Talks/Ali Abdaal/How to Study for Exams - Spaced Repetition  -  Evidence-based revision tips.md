# Summary of How to Study for Exams - Spaced Repetition | Evidence-based revision tips

Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z-zNHHpXoMM

The video provides evidence-based revision tips and advice on how to incorporate spaced repetition into a study routine. Spaced repetition involves spacing out repetition of subjects over time and interrupting the forgetting curve, making recalling information more effective. The video discusses the effectiveness of recalling information frequently, even within one study session, and using flashcards, such as the app Anki, to memorize specific facts and quotes. It also introduces the spaced repetition spreadsheet system for studying, which involves creating a Google sheet, listing topics that need to be reviewed and gradually building up a list of repetitions that helps improve retention and recall. The video concludes by sharing personal study systems and encouraging viewers to find a study method that works for them.

Detail Summary:

In this section, the speaker introduces the concept of spaced repetition, which is where you space out your repetition of particular subjects over a period of time instead of cramming. They explain that this technique is more effective because it interrupts the forgetting curve and every time you review, it takes longer for you to forget something. The speaker also mentions a phenomenon in the psychology literature whereby the harder your brain has to work to retrieve something, the more strongly the information is encoded. They advise starting off by spacing things at a narrow interval and spreading the interval out over time. Additionally, they mention that the evidence suggests that even spacing things out during the same study session rather than doing it in chunks is a more efficient technique in terms of retaining information.

In this section, the speaker discusses the results of an experiment that compared different methods of studying for exams, specifically focusing on spaced repetition. The experiment demonstrated the effectiveness of spaced repetition, even within one study session, in improving exam performance. The speaker suggests that rather than simply studying one topic and moving on, recall and testing oneself on previous topics in the same day can boost exam scores. The speaker also discusses the use of flashcards, specifically the app Anki, for memorizing specific facts and quotes for essays. The speaker acknowledges that these techniques may not work for everyone, but encourages viewers to try them out and see if they work for them.

In this section, the video discusses the technique of spaced repetition and how it can be applied not only to studying and revision but also to other areas of life where skills can be developed. The key is to practice consistently and patiently over time, rather than trying to cram everything in a short period. The video then introduces the spaced repetition spreadsheet system for studying, which involves creating a Google sheet for each subject and listing all the topics that need to be reviewed. The user then dates each topic every time it is studied and recalled, gradually building up a list of repetitions that helps improve retention and recall. The video emphasizes the importance of scoping one's subject and knowing the topics that need to be covered in order to use the system effectively.

In this section, the speaker shares his effective spaced repetition system for studying. He recommends using Google Sheets to create a chart with topics on one side and each time you revise and actively recall the topic on the other side. Color coding each box based on how well you recall the information provides a visual representation of what you need to focus on. The speaker advises starting with the topics you don't know and taking a scattergun approach by revising and actively recalling many different topics each day rather than dedicating hours to one topic at a time. This technique, called interleaved practice, has evidence to support its effectiveness. By focusing on active recall instead of just reading, the speaker believes that students can more efficiently learn the material.

In this section of the video, the speaker explains their own personal method of using spaced repetition to study for exams. They recommend using a scattergun approach to cover a large number of topics rather than focusing on a small number in great detail. The speaker also suggests using a spreadsheet to keep track of topics and mark when active recall has been successful. They also mention why they personally don't like revision timetables and why they prefer a more fluid approach to studying. Overall, the video provides useful tips and advice on how to incorporate spaced repetition into a study routine.

00:25:00
In this section, the speaker concludes the video by sharing his personal study system, which involves using a spreadsheet to organize his study time for each of his subjects. He notes that while there is no scientific evidence to support this system, it works for him and encourages viewers to find a study method that works for them as well. The speaker also thanks his viewers for watching and subscribing to his channel, which has been rapidly growing in popularity over the past few days. He promises to continue making videos about productivity, motivation, and medicine-related topics, including interviews and note-taking techniques.
