In this section of the 4 Million Subscriber Q&A, Ali asks Ali why he started podcasting and how much money he makes from it. Ali explains that he has two podcasts, one being a sporadic podcast with his brother called Not Overthinking, and his major one being Deep Dive where he interviews entrepreneurs, authors, academics, creators, and other inspiring people. Ali started podcasting because he wanted to learn from these people while sharing the conversation with his audience. He also enjoys having these conversations and gains energy from asking interesting questions. While the podcast is a source of revenue, it's not major compared to his YouTube channel or courses.
