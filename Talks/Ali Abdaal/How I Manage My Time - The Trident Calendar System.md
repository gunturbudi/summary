Matt D'Avella shares his Trident method for time management, which involves a three-pronged approach of year-at-a-glance planning, ideal week planning, and intentional time blocking. Using Google Sheets and Google Calendar, he defines containers of time for work, personal life, and sleep, and color codes his schedule accordingly. This system helps prioritize time and ensures productivity, while still leaving time for relationships and self-care. Other speakers also discuss the benefits of having a default schedule and being intentional with time to achieve balance and fulfillment in work, health, and relationships.

He created a Google sheet that displays the year so he can see the bird's eye view of his schedule. The second component is ideal week planning, and he suggests defining the ideal allocation of 112 hours per week using Google Calendar. By creating a new calendar called "Ali's ideal week," he is able to see a clean slate for his schedule planning.
