The video discusses the four different types of motivation and their placement on the motivation spectrum: intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, introjected motivation, and identified motivation. Understanding these types of motivation is key to staying motivated with whatever you want to do. The video also provides strategies to improve motivation, such as adding an element of choice, control, and autonomy to the activity, focusing on identified motivation by setting self-concordant goals, and making the task enjoyable, such as finding ways to make it challenging, fun, or social. Finally, the speaker highlights that even with identified motivation, procrastination can be a real roadblock.

In this section, the speaker discusses the four different types of motivation and their placement on the motivation spectrum. Intrinsic motivation is on one end of the spectrum and is when you are motivated to do something purely for the joy of doing it, whereas pure extrinsic motivation is on the other end of the spectrum, and is where you're doing something to avoid punishment or gain a reward. The two other types of motivation are introjected motivation, where you're beating yourself up for not doing something, and identified motivation, where you're doing something because you've integrated within yourself the importance of doing it. Understanding these four different types of motivation and where they lie on the motivation spectrum is key to staying more motivated with whatever you want to do.

motivating by adding an element of choice, control, and autonomy to the activity. Autonomy is a vital component for intrinsic motivation, and it means ownership or control. When something starts feeling like an obligation, it is often due to a loss of autonomy, such as being forced to do something instead of choosing to do it. To improve motivation, we must focus on identified motivation by setting self-concordant goals and reminding ourselves of our genuine interest in the outcome. Identity-based goals can make the activity feel more a part of one's identity, improving the intrinsic motivation to complete it. The last strategy to improve motivation is adding elements that make the task enjoyable, such as finding ways to make it challenging, fun, or social, which improves intrinsic motivation, making it easier to stay motivated in the long term.

In this section, the speaker discusses the mindset that one can have when it comes to being motivated. The key is to associate the reward with the challenge of the task itself, and try to genuinely get enjoyment out of the task, which creates intrinsic motivation. Additionally, having control over your own mindset can give you a greater sense of autonomy over your situation, and can generate identified motivation for a task rather than having to rely on extrinsic motivation. Finally, the speaker highlights that even with identified motivation, it can still be difficult to start a task and that procrastination can be a real roadblock.
