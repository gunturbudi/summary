# Summary of Study Tips - How to learn new content

Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=fBXnxlLR0PY

The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding and actively testing oneself while learning new material, rather than relying on memorization. Active recall is crucial in successful learning, and the speaker shares a story of a student who boosted their grades by quizzing themselves on material as they went along. Spacing out repetition through active recall and using techniques like spaced repetition is necessary to interrupt the forgetting curve and retain information for longer periods. Simply relying on memorization is not effective in the long term, and viewers are encouraged to watch more in-depth videos about active recall and spaced repetition for improved study techniques and exam results.

In this section, the speaker discusses two key components to successful learning; understanding and remembering. However, she first addresses a common mistake students make, which is relying on memorization instead of understanding when learning new material. She stresses the importance of actively testing oneself while reading instead of passively memorizing, using the technique of active recall. The speaker defines understanding as the competency to explain the material to others or being able to teach it. She emphasizes that true understanding is necessary for successful learning and retention, suggesting that memorization should only be used to reinforce core concepts.

In this section, the speaker discusses the importance of active recall as a fundamental part of actually learning new content, not just something you do after you have learned it. He shares a story of a medical student who struggled at first until he started quizzing himself on the material as he went along, which boosted his marks and eventually led him to the top of his class. The speaker emphasizes the need for testing yourself on the material and using spaced repetition to interrupt the forgetting curve. Without actively recalling the information, you are likely to forget it quickly.

In this section, the speaker emphasizes the importance of spacing out repetition to interrupt our forgetting curve and retain information for longer periods of time. The key is to understand the material first and explain it in our own words, without relying too much on jargon, and then using active recall and spaced repetition to maintain the foundation of our understanding. Memorization alone is not effective in the long term. The video encourages viewers to watch the speaker's more in-depth videos about active recall and spaced repetition to boost their study techniques and improve their exam results.
