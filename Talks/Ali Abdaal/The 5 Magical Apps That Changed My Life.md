In this section, the speaker discusses five magical apps that have changed their life. The first three apps make up the consumption layer, including Kindle, a read-it-later app like Instapaper or Pocket, and Airr.io. The speaker talks about how they use these apps to capture highlights or interesting bits from books, articles, podcasts, and tweets. They also talk about the benefits of using Instapaper, which helps them save articles they want to read for later. The integration layer app that the speaker loves is Readwise, which brings together all the insights that they capture from these apps.

In this section, the speaker talks about Readwise, an app that automatically brings together highlights from books, articles, tweets, and podcasts. It even connects to Instapaper for article highlights, and Air for podcast highlights. The app's primary benefit is that it can send a daily email with five randomly surfaced highlights, but recently it has added a game-changing feature: automatic export of highlights to Notion, the speaker's second brain app. This creates a special Readwise page in Notion that brings together all of the user's highlights and insights in one place, making it easy to search and access them. The speaker demonstrates how they can filter highlights by source and date, and even click on a highlight to open the app where it was made. Notion is now completely free of charge for individuals and students, and the speaker mentions that while it is sponsoring the video, they would still use it even if it weren't.

In this section, the speaker recommends setting up a personalized "magical insight logging framework" using apps like Kindle, Instapaper, Pocket, Air, and Readwise to mine information from books, podcasts, and articles and organize it in one central location using apps like Notion, Rome or Evernote. While the speaker has previously recommended iPads, he now receives more feedback from people who started using Notion because of him than those who bought iPads based on his recommendation. He invites viewers to check out his videos on how he uses Notion to organize his life and boost productivity.
