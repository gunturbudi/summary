The Kindle Scribe is a larger e-ink version of the original Kindle with a bezel and USB charging port on the side. Though the reading experience is good, it may require two hands and is not designed for one-handed use. This device is primarily for people who enjoy reading and taking notes at a desk with a pen. The Notebook feature allows for the creation of a new notebook with different page layouts, but notes written on the device do not appear on the computer, making it difficult for researchers and writers. The Kindle Scribe is hard to recommend over an iPad, which is more versatile for the same price. However, it is worth considering for those who specifically want an e-ink tablet for reading and writing. The reviewer still recommends the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite as the best Kindle on the market.

In this section, the reviewer discusses the design and reading experience of the Kindle Scribe, stating that it is a larger version of the regular Kindle with a bezel on the side and a USB charging port on the side. While the reading experience is just as good if not slightly better due to the bigger screen, reading on the Kindle Scribe may require two hands and is not designed to be a one-handed reading experience.

In this section of the video, the reviewer discusses the writing experience and note-taking capabilities of the Kindle Scribe. The notebook function allows for the creation of a new notebook with multiple page layouts, providing a solid writing experience with a pen that has an eraser on it. The true selling point of the Kindle Scribe, however, is the ability to take notes while reading. Handwritten notes and sticky notes can be added to highlights, but unfortunately, the handwritten notes do not appear on the computer, making it difficult for researchers and writers. Despite the extra features, such as backlight and dark mode, the reviewer finds it hard to recommend the Kindle Scribe over something like an iPad, which can do more for the same price. However, if someone specifically wants an e-ink tablet for reading and writing, the Kindle Scribe is worth considering.
