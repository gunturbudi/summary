The book 4,000 Weeks Time and How to Use It discusses the struggle that humans have with time, and how to make the most of it. It has a philosophical approach to productivity and time management. The book has a lot of examples of time problems that people face, such as online distractions, feeling unfulfilled in their lives, and decision paralysis. The book also has a section on clearing the decks, which is when people put off important tasks in order to focus on smaller tasks. This coping mechanism is often used by people in order to live in the present moment, but it can ultimately lead to stagnation.

The author suggests that we should embrace our limits by accepting defeat, rediscovering wonder, and finding meaning in infinity. He recommends three main steps: accepting defeat, rediscovering rest, and paying yourself first. He suggests that we should try and enjoy our leisure time, rather than treat it as a means to an end. He also suggests that we should choose a hobby that doesn't have much social status attached to it.
