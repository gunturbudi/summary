In this section, Ellie explains how she uses Google Sheets as a flashcard alternative for studying. Ellie emphasizes the importance of active recall, which involves testing oneself to help memorize information effectively. While flashcards are a common method for active recall, they have several drawbacks, such as taking a long time to make, ending up with a large deck of cards, and becoming a chore to go through. The Google Sheets method involves creating a spreadsheet with questions in one column and answers in another. The answers are hidden, which requires actively retrieving information from the brain. Ellie prefers this method to flashcards as the spreadsheet structure allows for systematic reviewing, which is particularly useful for subjects like medicine that require a systematic recall of information.
