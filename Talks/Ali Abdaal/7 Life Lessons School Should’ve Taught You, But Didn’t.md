In this section, the speaker discusses how school has failed to teach us about taking risks. The grading system in school encourages us to be perfectionists and to focus on the end result rather than the process of learning. However, the most successful people interviewed by the speaker have a bias towards action and spend less time overthinking and more time doing. Taking action is the foundation and overthinking can be sprinkled on top of it. The speaker encourages viewers to have a bias towards action and to recognize that it's easier to steer a moving ship than a stationary one.
