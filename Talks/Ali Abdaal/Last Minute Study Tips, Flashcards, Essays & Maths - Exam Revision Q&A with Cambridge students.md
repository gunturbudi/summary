Cambridge students offer exam revision tips, including engaging in active recall to learn and understand the topic, working with friends to understand difficult concepts, breaking down topics into manageable chunks, focusing on key areas of past papers, and practicing math by doing papers methodically. They recommend using spreadsheets, memorizing introductions to essays, and improving handwriting to score better on essays. They also caution against waiting until the last minute, suggest creating a timetable to stay on top of the material, and stress the importance of finding what works for individual students.

Detail Summary:

In this section, the Cambridge students answer questions about exam revision tips, starting with how to learn material before applying active recall. They advise engaging in the process of active recall in the process of learning and understanding the topic, and once a student can explain it to a five-year-old, they can write questions for themselves and engage in active recall. Retrieval is what drives learning, which means learning and revision should not be thought of as separate things. The students also emphasize trying questions in order to understand the topic better, especially for maths, and recommend trying to teach it to others to check for understanding.

In this section, the students discuss the benefits of studying with friends and treating exams as a team effort instead of a competition. They stress the importance of working together and leveraging each other's expertise to understand difficult concepts. They emphasize the need for a plan and suggest taking a step back to assess what has been covered and what still needs to be learned, but caution against getting overwhelmed and encourage breaking down the work into manageable chunks. Finally, they advise against waiting until the last minute and suggest creating a timetable to stay on top of the material.

In this section, the students discuss their study tips for preparing for exams. They suggest breaking down the topics into manageable chunks, focusing on the 20% of content that gets 80% of marks on past papers, and utilizing active recall to actively retrieve information from the brain. They also recommend using existing resources like revision guides and doing practice questions without looking at the answer key. When asked about using Anki, the students debate whether their spreadsheet method is still necessary or if custom decks and filters in Anki can accomplish the same goal. Ultimately, they stress the importance of finding what works for each individual student.

In this section, the YouTuber and his guest share tips for exam revision, particularly in relation to the use of spreadsheets and Anki flashcards. They argue that spreadsheets are easier to use than Anki, particularly as they can be sorted by category and tend to reduce friction between students' plans and actual work. Rather than spending a lot of time making lots of flashcards, which can often be unnecessary, they suggest that students can learn a few solid paragraphs, quotes, or pieces of evidence and then apply them to different essays. They also offer a tip for A-level maths, suggesting that students should prioritize practice papers over flashcards and should always try to reason from first principles before looking up the answer.

In this section, the Cambridge students give study tips for memorizing and writing essays, using flashcards and past papers, and practicing math. They emphasize on memorizing introductions to essays, which can make it easier for examiners to give good marks if it is done right. They also suggest practicing math by doing papers methodically, regardless of whether or not you have had practice with each topic. Additionally, they mention that improving handwriting is crucial for better essay scores, as examiners can be frustrated with difficult to read handwriting, and recommend watching YouTube videos to learn how to improve it.
