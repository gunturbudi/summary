In this section of the video, the speaker discusses five study tips related to target revision techniques. The first tip is to "scope the subject" by creating a visual representation of everything that needs to be learned for a particular subject through a tree diagram, which helps understand where facts and concepts fit into the wider picture. The second tip is to focus on weaknesses instead of strengths when preparing for exams by using a color-coding system to target specific weak areas. The third tip is to use a retrospective revision timetable, which helps to avoid procrastination and allows for more flexibility based on individual study needs. The fourth tip is that note-taking is not an effective way to learn, and students should consider other techniques backed by scientific literature. The fifth tip is to make use of active recall, which involves actively trying to remember key concepts by quizzing oneself, practicing past papers, and explaining concepts to others.

In this section, the speaker discusses effective studying techniques to improve memory retention. The first technique is to focus on understanding the material first rather than just memorizing it. The objective is to be able to explain the topic to someone without any prior knowledge of it. Another technique is active recall, where students should test themselves frequently to improve their memory. The second technique is spaced repetition, where information is revisited at varying intervals to ensure it's not forgotten over time. Lastly, interleaving is an effective technique where students mix different topics in a study session rather than blocking them out.

In this section, Ali Abdaal provides study techniques and tips that he believes helped him achieve first place at the University of Cambridge.

Additionally, Abdaal stresses the importance of taking mock exams throughout the study process to familiarize oneself with exam formatting and examination board expectations. He recommends using intentional flair, such as unique handwriting or creative introductions, in essay-style exam papers as it catches the examiner's attention, ultimately improving grades. Lastly, Abdaal strongly encourages studying with friends as it can result in greater motivation, an increased level of productivity, and a more enjoyable studying experience.
