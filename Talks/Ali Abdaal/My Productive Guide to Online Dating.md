In this section, the focus is on how to chat effectively to keep the conversation going with someone you matched with. You should avoid generic messages and instead make an effort to comment on something specific from their profile. You should also aim to keep the conversation going by dedicating 15 minutes to half an hour daily to reply to messages and arrange dates. When going on dates, you should consider choosing an activity that is more interesting than just going out for dinner, taking the pressure off the first date by assuming you'll go on the second date, and reflecting on how you felt during and after the interaction to evaluate if you want to see the person again.
