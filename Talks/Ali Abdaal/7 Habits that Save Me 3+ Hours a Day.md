In this section, the YouTuber discusses seven habits that save them at least three hours per day. The first habit is called the "capture" habit, where any time a thought or something that needs to be done comes to mind, it is immediately captured and offloaded onto another system to prevent distraction and wasted headspace. The second habit is the "daily adventure," where every morning, the YouTuber asks themselves what the day's adventure would be, encouraging them to think about their most important task for the day and approach it with more energy and enjoyment. The third habit is the "rainbow calendar," where the YouTuber color-codes their daily activities to avoid gaps in their calendar and prevent procrastination. The fourth habit is the "five-minute rule," where if struggling to start something, the YouTuber commits to just five minutes of work to get momentum going.

In this section, the YouTuber discusses four habits that save him a significant amount of time every day. The first is using the five-minute rule, which involves making use of any five-minute gap in the day to do something productive, like drafting a video or checking emails. The second is using a focus phone, which involves setting up focus modes on the phone and keeping the phone face down. Thirdly, the YouTuber recommends using an app called One Sec to break the social media habit by taking a breath before deciding to engage with phone apps. Lastly, he suggests using a physical alarm clock rather than a phone for better sleep hygiene and creating a rule to only watch TV with friends, saving him up to 60 minutes a day.

In this section, the speaker discusses the benefits of cutting out or reducing TV viewing, as it frees up a significant amount of time that can be better spent on other, more fulfilling activities. While some people may find this habit controversial and accuse it of promoting toxic productivity, the speaker encourages viewers to try it for themselves for at least a month and see if they miss it. Ultimately, if watching TV brings genuine enjoyment and is part of one's intentional living, then it may be worthwhile, but for many, cutting back on TV can help them save time and pursue more meaningful, fulfilling activities.
