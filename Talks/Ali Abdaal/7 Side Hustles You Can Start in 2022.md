In this section, the speaker suggests becoming a video editor for YouTubers as a side hustle. Learning video editing takes only a few days and can be self-taught, and many YouTubers need someone to edit their videos. Freelancing websites, such as Upwork and Fiverr, are places to offer these services. Alternatively, the speaker suggests becoming a permissionless apprentice by downloading a video of a YouTuber, adding value to it, and sending it to them unsolicited as a portfolio, which could lead to more paid work. This model can be applied to other creative skills, such as podcast editing, designing Instagram carousels, or turning long-form videos into shorter tick-tock-friendly content. Although making the first $100 is not hard, this side hustle can be time-intensive, as it requires charging for your time.

In this section, the speaker discusses two options for making money through teaching online, including online tutoring through websites like UK Tutors and iTalki. While a teaching qualification is not needed, one must have a skill to share and the ability to effectively market themselves on relevant tutoring websites. This is a time-intensive option as it involves trading time for money, but it is a fairly simple way to make money online. Another option is to become a website designer, which has become relatively easy due to no-code ways of building websites, such as Squarespace and WordPress. The key to success in this field is to appeal to a specific niche, rather than trying to appeal to everyone. The speaker provides examples of friends who have found success in niche website design, such as building websites for orthodontists or creating custom themes for Ghost, a WordPress alternative.

In this section, the video talks about several side hustles someone can start in 2022. One of these is creating themes for websites made with Notion, which can be sold multiple times after the initial work is done. Another idea is social media consulting for businesses, as most businesses are run by individuals over the age of 30 who may not be as familiar with social media. By offering consulting services or taking over social media accounts entirely, individuals with a skill in social media can make a living. Additionally, becoming a Notion consultant for small businesses can be lucrative by helping them streamline their business processes and creating internal wikis, standard operating procedures, and organizational charts.

In this section, the video suggests becoming a writer for businesses or creators who need help with their writing. With content marketing becoming a crucial aspect of businesses' online presence, they need writers who can produce high-quality articles that can help them rank better in search engine results. Similarly, creators, entrepreneurs, and YouTubers need help with researching, writing, and converting their content into different formats. This section recommends finding a niche, such as orthodontists or dentists, and pitching your writing services to them. Starting in this field requires a decent two out of five in difficulty, and the video recommends using examples of previously written articles to showcase your writing skills to potential clients.

In this section, the speaker discusses how to make your first $100 in the "permissionless apprentice" model, which involves finding business owners who have the financial capacity to pay for your services. He also briefly touches on the idea of starting a paid email newsletter and directs viewers to his interviews with writers and creators on the streaming platform, Nebula. The speaker encourages viewers to check out the platform, which offers exclusive content, including live stream interviews with entrepreneurs, writers, and creators who share their experiences on how they made money and built their brands.
