In this section, Ibz Mo and the guest discuss different tips for essay-based exams. The guest suggests that the best way to structure an essay is to start with stating what you're going to argue in the introduction, then sustainably argue your points throughout the essay. They also suggest that spider diagrams can be really useful to plan out an essay and to commit the plans to memory by doing spaced repetition, where you go back to the topic at different times to help you remember it better. Finally, they recommend creating a bank of essay plans and memorising them to prepare for potential essay titles that may come up in the exam.

In this section, Ibz Mo discusses two important study techniques: spaced repetition and active recall. Spaced repetition involves spacing out your revision so that you can actively remember information, rather than cramming it all in at once. Active recall is testing yourself regularly in a low-stakes fashion, which is more efficient than constantly rereading text. Ibz Mo recommends creating questions for yourself and constantly testing your knowledge to improve recall.
