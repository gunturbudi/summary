The budget iPad is the best value for money iPad that you can get. It has the A12 chip in it, which is very good. The budget iPad does not have the M1 chip in it, but most people probably won't notice the difference in performance between the A12 and M1 chips. The budget iPad also doesn't let you use the new Magic Keyboard, but you can use the Smart Keyboard, which is all right. The budget iPad starts at $330, but if you upgrade the storage, it ends up costing $430. The budget iPad is still a great value for money and is the best tablet on the market.

The iPad Pro is the best iPad to buy in 2021, followed by the iPad Air and then the iPad 8th generation.

The iPad Air is a good middle-of-the-line option, but it is only slightly better than the budget iPad and not as good as the iPad Pro. The iPad 8th generation is the budget option and is good for basic use, but it lags behind the other two options in terms of performance.
