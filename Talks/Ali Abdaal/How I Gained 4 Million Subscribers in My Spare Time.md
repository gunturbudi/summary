on about this book I would have mentioned it earlier. Anyway, the book talks about how building systems is the key to turning a small business into a successful one. A system is just a set of processes that you put in place to handle certain tasks, and these systems can be used to increase efficiency and consistency, allowing you to get more done with less effort. One example of a system that you could build for a YouTube channel is having a set schedule for filming and editing, so you're not constantly scrambling to get things done at the last minute. The second way to increase leverage is by outsourcing tasks. This is where you hire other people to handle tasks that you don't have the time or energy for, like editing or social media management. By outsourcing these tasks, you're able to free up more time and energy to focus on the things that you're best at. In short, leverage is all about finding ways to get more done with less effort, and by building systems and outsourcing tasks, you can make the most of your limited time and energy.

In this section, the speaker discusses the power of systems and leverage in business, using McDonald's as an example of a powerful franchise that has created systems for its processes and operations. By developing systems and processes for his own YouTube channel, such as idea generation, scripting, and video editing, the speaker found that he could increase his leverage and spend less time and energy doing the work. Additionally, he discovered that outsourcing the editing of his videos was the single biggest needle mover in growing his YouTube channel and allowed him to focus on the parts of video creation that he enjoyed the most. This led him to encourage others to outsource the parts of their businesses or YouTube channels that they don't personally need to do, allowing them to focus on the areas where they add the most value.

Additionally, Abdaal emphasizes the importance of consistency and building momentum by doing a little bit of work every day, even if it's just for a few minutes.
