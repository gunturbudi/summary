One of them is the gravestone technique, where one imagines what they want written on their gravestone and what others might say at their funeral. The second technique is the Odyssey plan where one outlines their vision for their life under three different conditions five years into the future, and the third technique is the Ideal Ordinary Week, where one plans out their ideal week including all desired activities and identifies any barriers that are in the way of achieving it. Repeating these exercises can lead to more clarity about one's passions and interests.
