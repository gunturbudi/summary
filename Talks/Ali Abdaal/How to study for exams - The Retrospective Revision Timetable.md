it's been a few days since I've revised the heart, the retroactive timetable helps me review that topic again before moving on to the other topics. This method is more flexible and allows for a more individualized approach to studying. The retrospective timetable also enables the student to track their performance on each topic and ensures that they cover every topic by the end of the revision period.

In this section, the speaker discusses the retrospective revision timetable, which is a study technique that focuses on active recall and spaced repetition. The technique involves listing all the topics within a subject and color-coding them based on the level of understanding. The student then studies the topics they are least confident of and repeats them at regular intervals. This ensures that the student focuses on their weak areas and efficiently prepares for exams without having to predict what will be on the exam. The speaker provides a Google sheet example of how they used the technique to perform well in their university psychology exams.
