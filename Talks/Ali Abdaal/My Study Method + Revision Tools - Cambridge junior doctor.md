Ellie, a junior doctor in Cambridge, shares her study method for preparing for the MRC og exam in obstetrics and gynecology. Her strategy consists of three phases: scoping the subject, filling knowledge gaps with a broad brushstroke approach, then revising in detail using active recall and spaced repetition. Her tools include Quizlet for flashcards, Google Sheets for tracking, and her iPad Pro with Apple Pencil for note-taking. Though textbooks are not her preferred method, they are necessary for her exam, which she plans to document on YouTube with study-with-me videos.

In this section, we learn about the study strategy of Ellie, a junior doctor working in Cambridge. Ellie is documenting her process of preparing for MRC og, a postgraduate medical exam in obstetrics and gynecology.

The strategy consists of three phases: scoping the subject, filling the knowledge gaps, and revising using a broad brushstroke overview. Ellie admits that the subject matter is vast and goes into unlimited detail on every topic, but she is not going to memorize textbooks on every single condition. Instead, she is going to use a broad-brush approach to fill the gaps in her knowledge.
