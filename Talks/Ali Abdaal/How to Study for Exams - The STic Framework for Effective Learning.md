# Summary of How to Study for Exams - The STic Framework for Effective Learning

Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=k5A26Sc63F0

In this video, the STIC framework is introduced, which stands for spacing, testing, interleaving, and categorizing, as the four most important principles for effective and efficient learning. The video emphasizes the importance of testing and spacing, with testing being the single most important thing for boosting exam scores. Spacing out study sessions is found to be far more efficient than cramming everything in one session, and building a categorization system or "tree of knowledge" for a subject can make it easier to understand. The concept of interleaving is also discussed, which involves mixing up the things you want to learn by using mixed practice. The video emphasizes that learning should be difficult and mentally taxing, as the harder you have to work to retrieve information, the more strongly that information is encoded.

In this section, the speaker introduces the STIC framework, which stands for spacing, testing, interleaving, and categorizing, as the four most important principles for effective and efficient learning. The importance of spacing and testing is emphasized, with testing being the single most important thing that can be done to boost exam scores, according to the author of "Make It Stick." The concept of spacing, or space repetition, is also discussed, along with the phenomenon of the forgetting curve, which refers to the decay of memory over time. The speaker emphasizes that testing oneself before, during, and after studying a topic is the best way to actually learn that topic, while spacing out study sessions so that some information is forgotten before re-studying it can improve memory retention.

In this section, the video discusses the importance of spacing, testing, interleaving, and categorizing when studying for exams. Studies have shown that spacing out study sessions over time is far more efficient than cramming everything into a single session. Building a categorization system or "tree of knowledge" for a subject can make it easier to understand by breaking it down into smaller categories and increasing the chances of retaining the information. The video provides an example of creating a tree of knowledge for hematology and how it helped the creator better understand the subject.

In this section, the speaker talks about the importance of interleaving, which is mixing up the things you want to learn by using mixed practice. By doing this, you will struggle more and take longer to learn, but you'll also learn how to match a strategy to a type of problem, which will help you form conceptual models for knowledge. It's important to note that learning should be difficult and mentally taxing as the harder you have to work to retrieve information, the more strongly that information is encoded, and therefore the more you learn. The speaker emphasizes that if you're finding it hard to learn, you are doing it right. The concept of interleaving is talked about quite extensively in the book "Make it Stick," which the speaker highly recommends.
