In this video, three ways to make better choices in life are addressed: first, asking yourself what identity you want to be; second, asking yourself if the challenge is worth the potential reward; and third, asking yourself if the thing you're scared of is really that bad. If the answer to any of these is no, then it's time to quit. If the thing you're scared of is really that bad, but you can mitigate against the risk of it happening, then don't quit.
