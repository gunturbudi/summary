wouldn't have been inspired to start
sharing my experiences and write about
them in a blog. The book Show your Work
by Austin Cleon taught me to get over the
fear of self-promotion and to share my

is that by sharing your work with the
world, you are inherently helping people.

In this section, the speaker talks about the book "Anything You Want" by Derek Sivers that had a huge impact on him as it emphasizes the counter-intuitive approach to business and life that involves not always chasing growth, but rather focusing on making something that you enjoy running, helps people, and is profitable enough. He shares how this approach helped him when his company's growth started to stagnate and even dip, and how the book's favorite quote of all time helped him feel better and happier by reminding him of his reasons behind doing what he's doing. The speaker encourages everyone to read this book as it contains many life lessons not just for entrepreneurship.
