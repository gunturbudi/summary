The video discusses seven different side hustles that people can start in 2023. The first idea is content writing, specifically for businesses' blogs or for creators on social media or YouTube. The video also explores sales copywriting, thumbnail design, and website design as creative services that require some effort to learn but have a good potential payoff. Another idea is freelance web design, where the video recommends marketing services to the right people rather than competing with thousands of other web designers. The video also suggests becoming a solopreneur's personal assistant or operations manager and becoming a one-person video production agency as side hustles with high potential payoff. All of these side hustles require some skill and effort, but they offer a good opportunity to make extra money or potentially transition to full-time work.

In this section of the video, the speaker discusses the philosophy of side hustles and explains what a good side hustle should be like. He describes how a side hustle should allow a person to make more money than a local service job, be something enjoyable and fulfilling, and be flexible. He also emphasizes the importance of understanding the law of making money, which is based on providing value to people who are willing to pay for it. The speaker then introduces the first side hustle idea, which is becoming a writer for businesses. He explains how businesses, both B2C and B2B, are always looking for writers, and this could be an excellent opportunity to build a skill and offer a valuable service.

In this section, the video discusses the side hustle of content writing, which involves writing articles for businesses' blogs to help with their search engine optimization (SEO) and increase leads and sales. Another area of content writing is working as a writer for creators on platforms such as YouTube or social media, where a single script can cost up to $1,000. The video recommends using the permissionless apprentice model, which involves doing work for free for favorite creators, and then showing them the work to land paid work in the future. While writing requires trading time for money, AI tools can make it easier and help writers leverage their abilities to create their own assets or move to passive income streams. The video also shared another side hustle idea of becoming a sales copywriter, which involves writing sales copy for products and courses, and can be learned through reading books on sales, marketing, and persuasion.

In this section, the speaker discusses three side hustle ideas related to providing creative services: sales copywriting, thumbnail designing, and website designing. Sales copywriting involves crafting persuasive language for businesses to increase their profits, and while it may take some time to master, it can lead to recommendations and recurring clients. Thumbnail design is a service that every YouTuber needs, and if one can develop an eye for aesthetics and learn graphic design, they could make a lot of money from it. Finally, website design was how the speaker started their own online side hustle at the age of 13, and while it may take some time and effort to learn, there is a demand for it in the business world. All in all, these creative services require some skill and effort to learn and improve, but they offer the potential for recurring clients and good pay.

In this section, the speaker discusses the potential of freelance web design as a profitable side hustle. He emphasizes the importance of marketing one's services to the right people, rather than competing with thousands of other web designers on platforms like Fiverr. He shares the example of a freelance web designer named Henry, who taught himself web design during the pandemic and has since been able to charge over $10,000 per website. The speaker also suggests becoming a short-form video editor, as the demand for video production is rising with the popularity of platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels. He shares an example of a successful approach to landing freelance work in this field through a well-crafted direct message. The speaker believes it is not difficult to start making money as a video editor, as long as one has reasonable communication skills and a portfolio.

00:20:00
In this section, the video suggests becoming a solopreneur's second pair of hands as a side hustle. Solopreneurs, such as YouTubers or streamers, often need help with tasks like content creation, email management, and conference booking. By offering to be their personal assistant or operations manager, you could start a part-time side hustle that could potentially become a full-time job. Communication skills are essential for this side hustle, and taking on all the risks of your offer could make it easier for the person to say yes. While making your first $100 is easy, this can be a time-intensive job paid by the hour, but it can lead to more significant opportunities in the future.

00:25:00
In this section, the video suggests becoming a one-person video production agency, as there is a high demand for video content from businesses of all types. By offering your services as a videographer, editor, and video producer, you can work with all kinds of companies and be flown to exciting places to film various events. You can also make money as a YouTube channel producer, making videos for software companies that need to increase organic traffic. With flexible work arrangements and high margins in the field, video production is a lucrative and underrated service that not many people offer. You can start by filming videos on your phone or reaching out to local businesses to build up your skills and get examples to use when presenting to potential clients. It may take time and effort, but with the growing demand for video content, making your first $100 as a videographer won't be very hard.
