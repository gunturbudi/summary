He realized that YouTube was not going to last forever, and he needed to take his audience and bring them somewhere that he could turn into a real business. He created a marketplace on his website, where viewers could buy the cars he reviewed, and he could monetize his reviews in a different way.

In this section, Doug DeMuro advises creators to enjoy what they do because success means the opportunity to do more of it.

DeMuro also touched on the pros and cons of being two people running a company, where conflicts arise from individual lifestyles, but the advantage is riffing off each other and having occasional useful conversations.
