However, she has been highly successful, earning up to $25,000 from just AdSense. Ashley talks about the complexities of being a lifestyle vlogger, such as how to price yourself and how to work with brands.

She mentions the importance of learning from what works, not just what doesn't, and the value of looking back at your progress and growth as a creator.
