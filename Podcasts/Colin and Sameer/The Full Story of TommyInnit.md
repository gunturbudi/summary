While the team had already created a theatrical story in the server, TommyInnit's addition was a game-changer, adding a political and literary dimension to it. Though he was hesitant to let Tommy join because he knew he would behave like a "dick" and engage in griefing, Dream invited him as he saw an element of chaos in him. While some Minecraft YouTubers are careful and calculated in their approach, Tommy's success came from throwing things out there that he found funny and cool, without worrying too much about the outcome. He draws inspiration from his favorite YouTuber, Schlatt, and believes in making things that he loves, with or without paid work.

Despite his explosive growth in subscribers and income, he still had a four-pound meal deal in the park and continued going to college. He primarily earns money through YouTube, Twitch, and merchandise, and he has only done two brand deals. At one point, he stopped using copyrighted music in his videos and realized that he did not want to compromise his integrity for money.

00:15:00
In this section, TommyInnit talks about how his business came to be. He recounts how his PayPal account getting locked led to his dad discovering how much money he was making, which then led to a series of business meetings about invoices and taxes. He eventually started a team with his dad and producer Russ. They have a Minecraft team and an editing team, with Larry being his main editor. TommyInnit values his crew and always publicly credits his editors, despite the risk of them getting poached by bigger YouTubers. He also talks about the importance of focusing on putting out content regularly rather than perfectionism.

00:20:00
In this section, TommyInnit shares the process of how his editing team was formed. Initially, they received 600 applications, which they narrowed down to the top 50 video editors who were paid to create an edit of a 60-second video clip. From there, they looked at everyone's highlight reel and decided to assign specific tasks based on which areas each person demonstrated strength, such as music, comedic timing, and subtitle effects. TommyInnit explains how having specialists helps them focus on their specific aspect, which ultimately leads to a better final product. He also shares how his dad helped with the production aspect, allowing him to concentrate on being creative.

He plans to take time after his live show to reflect on his journey so far and figure out what he enjoys the most in order to realign his priorities and achieve greater fulfillment in his career.

00:30:00
In this section, TommyInnit talks about his experience with creator burnout and how he navigated his way out of it. He talks about how he would constantly question why he was doing what he was doing and how he resolved that issue by taking long walks with his dad and chatting with other YouTubers to gain different perspectives. He also learned the importance of taking time for himself and finding hobbies outside of work. Despite the uncomfortable experience he had during his appearance on "Impaulsive", he enjoyed the conversation with Logan Paul and found him to be a very funny person.

00:35:00
In this section of the interview, YouTuber TommyInnit talks about his experience in a challenging interview that started off difficult but eventually became fun for him. He also discusses how he relates to comedian Bo Burnham and his recent project, Inside. Tommy admires Burnham's ability to create without stressing about analytics and his success, saying he aspires to have that level of creativity in his own work. He also talks about how he enjoys the adaptive and immediately responsive nature of improvisation during his streams, but also mentions his recent experience writing a book with a friend, which has also turned out to be enjoyable. Finally, Logan Paul asks Tommy if he believes that social media is a form of art and whether everything uploaded to YouTube can be considered as such. Tommy responds by stating that he views social media as a video game and acknowledges that some creators make more significant works of art.

00:40:00
In this section, the speaker discusses how YouTube is like a video game, but also acknowledges that it can still be a platform for creating art. They note that the focus on views and clickbait can sometimes overshadow quality, and that there is a delicate balance between creating content that appeals to the algorithm while still maintaining artistic integrity. They also discuss how the fast-paced nature of YouTube can sometimes result in sacrificing quality for the sake of more views, and how experimenting and taking risks is necessary for the platform to continue to produce new and exciting content.

00:45:00
In this section, TommyInnit discusses how he learned from Dream about remembering the reasons why he is successful and amplifying them, such as his funniness and editing skills. He also talks about the negative impact of comparing oneself to others on the YouTube platform, particularly the trend of amplifying what makes MrBeast successful. TommyInnit expresses exhaustion with the hyper-real thumbnails and the prompt of money, which he thinks are forcing MrBeast to keep progressing and are not good for creativity. He mentions Ryan Trahan as the person he is most proud of for being confident with his own style and not trying to be like MrBeast while still taking elements of his trend.

00:50:00
In this section of the video, the YouTubers discuss their concerns around the "Mr. Beastification" of YouTube, where creators try to replicate the success of Mr. Beast by creating attention-grabbing, high-view videos. They suggest that while it's important to experiment and try new things, it's also important to be true to oneself when creating content, and for creators to be aware of the impact their videos may have on others. They also discuss the potential for a counter-culture that focuses on slower, more deliberate videos, and the cyclical nature of YouTube trends over time. The discussion touches on the phenomenon of celebrity and fandom, and the responsibility that comes with being in the public eye.

00:55:00
In this section of the video, TommyInnit talks about the difference between his two channels, Tom Simons (his real name) and TommyInnit. He explains that Tom Simons is more real and exposing, while TommyInnit is meant to be more silly and ridiculous. However, he wants to have a more serious outlet to talk about his views on YouTube, specifically, and have more control over it, given that interviews have been that for him in the past. He also talks about the next chapter of YouTube evolving and how people who are creating YouTube videos will use the platform as a springboard to try new things. However, the main lesson of those who have come before them is not to quit YouTube, unless it doesn't align with their personal goals. The video then touches on the success of KSI in music, which TommyInnit sees as a natural progression of talent being discovered on social media.

01:00:00
In this section, the discussion focuses on how creators will evolve as they pursue other interests while retaining their presence on YouTube. KSI is used as an example of a creator who has achieved success in other areas while still being active on the platform. The conversation touches upon retaining audience loyalty by continuing to produce content that resonates with them. The conversation eventually leads to a discussion about the future of the internet and what the next big thing will be. The problem that needs to be solved is how to make money when people are not looking at ads. One prediction is that being on your phone will eventually become uncool, leading to a reset in culture.

01:05:00
