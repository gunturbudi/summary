In this section of the video, Indra Rudiansyah talks about his experiences in studying molecular biology and how he gained practical skills in handling lab equipment during his undergraduate education at ITB. He also discusses how his interest in molecular biology was piqued during a practicum in microbiology and how he was introduced to the iGEM competition by a senior. He then talks about his decision to pursue a graduate degree through the Fast Track program and how he had to look for work experiences afterwards despite his interest in postgraduate education due to financial constraints.

00:15:00
In this section, the interviewee talks about how they got their job at Biofarma, a vaccine manufacturing company in Bandung, Indonesia, and their thoughts on the future of vaccine production. Initially, they had received an offer from a palm oil company that needed a molecular biologist, but after their parents advised them to apply for a job at Biofarma, they ended up working there. The interviewee also discusses how their work experience at Biofarma led them to pursue a postgraduate degree in order to contribute to research for new vaccines that could tackle diseases such as HIV, malaria, and TB. Additionally, the interviewee mentions that they received an LPDP scholarship to study at Oxford and are grateful for the opportunity to further their education.

00:20:00
In this section, Indra Rudiansyah, a molecular biology researcher, talks about his experience joining the marching band during his university days. He explains how he didn't have a background in music and couldn't read musical notes before joining, but he signed up for two units that could teach him things he couldn't do, one of which was the marching band. He explains how the training was like military training and required high discipline and team-mindedness, making it more challenging than molecular biology. Although he now focuses on molecular biology and doesn't play the mellophone anymore, he expresses interest in playing it again if there is an opportunity.

00:25:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the vaccine technology platforms and explains how vaccines are typically made by extracting pathogens and introducing them to the body to produce an immune response. However, biomolecular technology has made it possible to produce the protein that induces the immune response through cloning and breeding in yeast. The speaker also talks about the platform technology developed by Sarah Gilbert and Catherine Green at Oxford, which utilizes DNA with a double-stranded molecule to improve the capacity to follow the latest viral mutations, while Pfizer Biotech and Moderna are using RNA in their vaccines. The speaker explains that everything comes from one core and that statistics has become the foundation of data science.

00:30:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the process of creating vaccines using viral vector technology. The genetic information of a pathogen or virus is loaded into a vehicle, usually an adenovirus, as a blueprint for protein production, which is then put into the body to be self-reproduced. However, using an adenovirus from humans could reduce the vaccine's effectiveness because pre-existing antibodies can neutralize the vaccine vehicle earlier. Therefore, Sarah Gilbert and her team discovered a chimpanzee adenovirus that rarely invades humans to use as a vector in various vaccine models. The speaker also explains that the first vaccines licensed for emergency use during the pandemic used viral vector or RNA platforms, which have high flexibility and can respond quickly. Additionally, RNA technology has shorter steps than DNA technology and allows for single-stage production. However, at the time of creating the vaccine, mRNA platforms were difficult to apply due to the rapid degradation of mRNA and difficulty in stabilizing it.

00:35:00
In this section, the video discusses the technology behind the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, specifically the use of RNA and viral vector delivery systems. The body tends to degrade RNA quickly, making it a challenge to use, but the delivery system for RNA was improved by using a formula to wrap the mRNA so that it could be directly inserted into the cytoplasm of cells. However, at the time, viral vector technology was considered more straightforward and had adequate resources available for use. The findings of Sarah Gilbert and the team were not patented, which allowed for the development of cheaper vaccines with more efficient production methods. Carina Joe, an Indonesian, was responsible for developing the production method for the AstraZeneca vaccine and had the patent for the technology. The decision to not take royalties from the sales of the vaccine's patent meant that the price of the vaccines were only the cost of goods and allowed for the production of a lot of them.

00:40:00
In this section, the importance of vaccinating everyone against COVID-19 is highlighted, as the virus's replicating nature makes it easy for it to mutate and create new, potentially stronger variants. The affordability and effectiveness of the Oxford Astrazeneca vaccine are also discussed. The vaccine's platform allows for quick adaptations to new mutations, ensuring the vaccine's effectiveness is maintained. The team behind the vaccine will immediately create a new vaccine for new variants to ensure existing vaccines' effectiveness does not decrease dramatically.

00:45:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the efficacy of vaccines against new variants such as the Beta variant or the South African strain. While some vaccines like AstraZeneca can be less effective, the antibodies produced still have neutralization capacity with decreased capability. However, the effectiveness of the vaccine against newly emerging variants is not only determined by whether the antibody can still neutralize the virus, but also by other supporting components in the body such as T cells and Innate Response. Additionally, the speaker mentions how demographics and genetic backgrounds can affect vaccine efficacy and how the vaccine regimen or duration between doses can also impact immune response. Overall, there are many factors to consider when assessing vaccine efficacy against new variants.

00:50:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the importance of stronger data surveillance to prevent the reactivation of dormant viruses that could produce more dangerous variants and to better anticipate the possibility of future pandemics caused by frequent contact with wild animals. The speaker emphasizes that vaccination is important to control the spread of COVID-19 and that there should be more affordable and accessible vaccines available for public use. The discussion also touches on the potential of CRISPR technology in treating chronic diseases and the need to approach it with caution.

00:55:00
In this section, the conversation revolves around CRISPR technology and its positive and negative effects. While it can modify genetic diseases and make people resistant to HIV, its impact on our body still remains vague, and experts are concerned about the moral and ethical implications of its misuse, which can lead to eugenics. While some believe that using CRISPR to treat a child's illness is ethically acceptable, determining whether modifying eyes to be blue is therapeutic or augmenting is a topic that needs attention from experts in various fields, and developing a consensus on these issues is essential.
