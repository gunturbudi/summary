In this section, Carina Joe, the owner of AstraZeneca's patent, talks about her experience pursuing a PhD while working full-time. She shares the challenges of balancing two full-time jobs and working on her PhD project, which focused on designing a hepatitis B vaccine to be more effective and developing technology to target brain cancer. Joe's research led her to create seven new technologies to treat chronic hepatitis B, which weren't previously available. They have IP implications that caused conflicts between the university and spin-off companies. She reflects on how IP rights should be addressed and negotiated between industry and academia in the future.

00:25:00
In this section, Carina Joe discusses her experience with intellectual property and collaboration. She mentions her collaboration with an external course supervisor on a project for her thesis, which turned out to be successful. However, she did not receive intellectual property rights due to a lack of a clear agreement. She also discusses a friend's experience with a long legal battle over intellectual property with a large company, emphasizing the importance of academic recognition. Carina later talks about her move from Melbourne to Oxford, where she was offered a job by the largest government-owned company due to her work on a master's and PhD project with the same supervisor. She also mentions receiving an offer from a competitor in Australia that was working on a COVID vaccine in 2019.

00:30:00
In this section, Carina Joe, an Indonesian woman who owns a patent at AstraZeneca, shares how she came to work at Oxford in the United Kingdom, and how she was chosen among many applicants to work for the company. Joe explains that she did not choose a job based on the project itself, but rather on the person she would be working for, as she is a generalist and is not confined to any particular field. She also talks about how her future boss, a young Scottish doctor, impressed her with his expansive knowledge and enthusiasm during her job interview, and how she was eventually hired after undergoing a series of tests in both mathematics and essay writing, despite the time difference between the UK and Australia.

In this section, Carina Joe, an Indonesian woman who holds a patent for AstraZeneca, talks about her experience working as a postdoc in Oxford and the difference in pay between academia and industry. She discusses how some universities struggle to recruit top postdocs due to the lure of higher salaries in the industry. Despite being offered a lower salary than what she could have earned in Australia, where she previously worked, Joe decided to prioritize impact and chose to work on a completely new project that she found interesting. She also talks about how the technology at the university was not as up-to-date as she had expected, and how she had to work alone in a cramped lab where she had to do everything from making buffers to measuring powders herself.

00:40:00
In this section, Carina Joe, the Indonesian owner of the AstraZeneca patent, talks about how she initially thought it was impossible to create a COVID-19 vaccine using the outdated technology she was using. She thought it was foolish when the project went from targeting hundreds of millions of doses to making 3 billion within a few months. She initially worked on a rabies vaccine project, but due to the pandemic, her focus switched to COVID-19. Her work involved improving vaccine production and safety standards to enable phases 2 and 3 clinical trials. The technology used at AstraZeneca Oxford is viral vectors from chimpanzees, which originated from simians and not RNA, unlike Pfizer and Moderna. Adenoviruses are used, which are similar to common cold viruses, but are mutated to not be harmful or replicate in humans.

00:45:00
In this section, Carina Joe, an Indonesian woman who owns a patent for the AstraZeneca vaccine, explains how they inserted the genetic sequence of the COVID-19 spike protein into a viral vector to create the vaccine. She compares their method with Pfizer and Moderna's use of modified nucleotides mRNA, stating that their viral vector technology was tested clinically for ebola and MERS, and had a high immune response and a high safety profile. When asked about how long she worked in the lab, Joe revealed that she worked around 16-18 hours a day, 7 days a week, out of necessity due to the urgency of the situation. She also discussed the algorithm she created to scale up the production of the vaccine, which she believes is sufficient to produce billions of doses.

00:50:00
In this section, Carina Joe, the Indonesian patent holder for the AstraZeneca vaccine, explains the difficulties involved in creating the vaccine, specifically in the upstream process of using human cells to make it. She also discusses the challenge of scaling up production from a small amount to billions of doses, which requires adherence to CGMP standards and complete protocols. The importance of herd immunity, distribution, and execution of the vaccine is emphasized, as the actual use of it is necessary for it to be effective. Moreover, Joe talks about the stress caused by working alone and not having enough time during the critical stage of production due to COVID-19, resulting in a shortage of workers who could assist in the lab work.

00:55:00
In this section, Carina Joe shares the challenges she faced while conducting her experiments for AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine. Joe had to run experiments at 45 different places simultaneously, and because she was working alone, she didn't have the luxury to experience stress. Her company's data was on the line, and there was no room for failure since at that time, they didn't have any funding from the government, and they had used their own budget from other projects. With the limited funds and no workforce, she had to train and work with other companies that had no knowledge in this field. Joe had to work alone most of the time, and she was the only person who knew how to work on that project. She could not take chances. Even her supervisor was unhappy with the situation. Her social life was non-existent since she was only allowed to be in the lab and go home for a quick shower, and she didn't go anywhere else. Despite all these challenges, Carina Joe worked diligently and played a significant role in finding a COVID-19 vaccine that is now helping the world.

In this section, Carina Joe, an Indonesian woman who holds a patent for AstraZeneca, shares her thoughts on how the pandemic has made people more aware of the importance of vaccines. She explains the unprecedented speed at which vaccines were developed in response to the pandemic, with development starting before the first phase of clinical trials. She also acknowledges that future pandemics are inevitable, but highlights the potential risks if the virus were more complex, as well as the potential for more lethal pathogens in the future. Joe notes that vaccine technology has traditionally not been a priority for the pharmaceutical industry and predicts that funding for vaccine development will drop after the pandemic ends.

01:05:00
In this section, Carina Joe discusses the importance of developing the necessary tools and technologies to handle any future evolution of viruses. While there is knowledge available, the funding is unfortunately not always sufficient, with science budgets being cut in many countries. She talks about the dilemma between prioritizing monetary gain versus the interests of human health, stating that while she understands the need for profit, she and her team are idealistic in wanting to distribute life-saving vaccines for free to those in need, especially in developing nations. Additionally, she discusses the need for more female representation in the sciences, acknowledging that while there are many women studying science, they are not as well-represented in leadership positions. She hopes to inspire other women to pursue careers in scientific research.
