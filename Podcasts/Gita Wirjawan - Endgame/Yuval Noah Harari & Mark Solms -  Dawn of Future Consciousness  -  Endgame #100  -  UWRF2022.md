Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Yuval Noah Harari and Mark Solms discuss the mind and brain, discussing how they are both parts of the same evolutionary process. They also discuss the evolution of consciousness and how it ties in with the evolution of the mind.

00:05:00
Yuval Noah Harari discusses the evolution of the mind and the dawn of consciousness, which he believes long precedes the evolution of primates and hominids. He argues that what is special about human minds is our ability to create entirely new entities in the universe, in reality-things like money. Harari also discusses the social skills that humans develop as a result of our imaginative capabilities, which allows us to attain any kind of leadership in any dimension.

00:10:00
In this video, Yuval Noah Harari and Mark Solms discuss the evolution of the human brain, and how the ability to create imagined reality and cooperate with others has led to our dominance over chimpanzees. While the anatomical and physiological differences between human and chimpanzee brains are not that significant, the prefrontal cortex has enabled humans to think abstractly and develop language. Mark argues that while humans are rightly proud of our intellectual capacities, we should not forget that we are also animalistic and prone to rage.

00:15:00
Yuval Noah Harari discusses how human aggression is different from that of other primates, and how wars and genocides are a new phenomenon in the history of humanity. He believes that political leaders should be held responsible for making decisions that lead to conflicts.

00:20:00
Yuval and Mark discuss the evolution of consciousness and the possible benefits and drawbacks of artificial consciousness. They agree that the principle that consciousness can be used for the better or worse applies to the current state of affairs, and that we have a responsibility to manage ourselves in a way that incorporates an understanding of our base instincts.

00:25:00
The two discuss the dangers and opportunities of artificial general intelligence, with Harari cautioning against rapid development. They also discuss the potential consequences of castration for eunuchs in the Chinese and Middle Eastern empires.

00:30:00
Yuval Noah Harari and Mark Solms discuss the potential for artificial intelligence to go bad, and how we should be thinking about the rights of sentient computers and robots. Solms argues that we should be careful not to create new slaves, and reminds us that some of the positive emotions that we share with other primates are also bad.

00:35:00
Meditation does not create anything new, but instead brings attention to what is already in one's mind. This can help bring about more wisdom.

00:40:00
Yuval Noah Harari and Mark Solms discuss the role of social media in contemporary society, and Harari points out that while it can be used for good, it also has negative consequences. Harari urges for more attention to be paid to our subjective nature and to the wisdom of ancient traditions.

00:45:00
Yuval Noah Harari and Mark Solms discuss the importance of psychoanalysis and meditation in the age of future consciousness, and how they can help us to better understand ourselves and our relationships. They argue that, in the current social media environment, democracy is at risk due to the increasing inability of people to have civilized conversations. They also discuss the dangers of a "culture of anger," and how understanding ourselves deeply is the source of true happiness.

00:50:00
Yuval Noah Harari discusses the two types of sensation that humans experience and how the mind reacts to them. He explains that the like button and the effect it has on our behavior is what has led to the current state of society. He emphasizes the importance of meditative practices in order to reach a state of equilibrium and Nirvana, which is a state of total satisfaction.

00:55:00
Yuval Noah Harari discusses how humans have been tricking themselves by relying on "it's enough" instead of seeking to meet our emotional needs. He cites the example of attachment and separation distress, noting that when we try to cheat reality, we end up self-destructively. He also discusses how history has shown that when a country becomes power addicted, it starts wars with other countries.

01:00:00
Yuval Noah Harari and Mark Solms discuss the need for compassion in the future, noting that it is built on understanding oneself and recognizing the reality of one's own inner soul. They discuss how morality is not only about obeying external laws but also about reducing suffering. They argue that when one causes suffering to others, they are also causing suffering to themselves. They go on to say that it is important to develop a sense of compassion for others, even if one does not share their religious or cultural beliefs.

01:05:00
Yuval Noah Harari and Mark Solms discuss the current state of morality and how it may be improved in the future. They posit that technological innovation has made the margin of error smaller and that future Hitlers will be able to re-engineer the human body and mind, potentially causing immense damage. Yuval suggests that it is up to historians like himself to think about ways to improve democracy, and Mark offers some hope that things may still turn out alright in the end.

Yuval Noah Harari and Mark Solms discuss the potential for humanity to improve upon its past mistakes, and the importance of having a democracy in which citizens can have a conversation about the government's actions.
