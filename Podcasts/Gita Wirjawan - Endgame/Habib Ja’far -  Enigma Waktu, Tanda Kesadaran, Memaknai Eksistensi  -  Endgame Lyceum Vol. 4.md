Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
In this section, Habib Ja'far discusses the philosophy of time, which he says is closely related to the philosophy of space and epistemology. He argues that in the era of post-truth, truth is no longer determined solely by the truth itself, but by who presents it. Therefore, it's important to understand how we obtain knowledge, as the wrong tools or methods may lead to mistakes in our pursuit of truth. Habib Ja'far suggests that the way we think determines our character, habits, actions, and ultimately, our fate.

00:05:00
In this section, Habib Ja'far discusses how our fate is largely determined by our character, which is formed by our habits and actions. For example, if we have a habit of showing off and being arrogant, people will not want to be around us and we may experience negative consequences. Our thoughts and beliefs also shape our character, which in turn determines our destiny. Habib Ja'far goes on to explain that our beliefs are influenced by our epistemology, which is the study of knowledge and how we come to know things. Ultimately, he emphasizes the importance of cultivating rational and ethical beliefs in order to shape a meaningful and purposeful existence.

00:10:00
In this section, philosopher Habib Ja'far discusses the power of intention and how it relates to the formation of our thoughts. He mentions the Frankfurt school of philosophy, which highlights the importance of critically examining what society considers to be true. He also specifically looks at the concepts of space and place, noting that not all places are spaces that allow for the growth of consciousness. He emphasizes that intention plays a key role in shaping our thoughts and that we must be aware of the underlying factors influencing what we believe to be true.

00:15:00
In this section, Habib Ja'far discusses the concept of public space and how it can promote healthy discussions and the growth of ideas. He cites the example of cafes and their proliferation in various locations, which is due to the advocacy of Jurgen Habermas for public space. He also emphasizes that a big place may not necessarily become a big discussion forum, while a small place can become a big one, citing the example of the mosque of Prophet Muhammad, which is small in terms of area but has given birth to various ideas like entrepreneurship and military policies up to the present. Another example he mentions is the Cokroaminoto boarding house in Indonesia, where the ideas of nationalism, communism, and Islam were all born.

00:20:00
In this section, Habib Ja’far discusses the concept of time and how it is not simply measured by seconds or heartbeats, but rather by consciousness. He emphasizes that having physical space does not necessarily equate to having ample room, just as having time on one’s hands does not mean it is being used meaningfully. Rather, time should be perceived based on our awareness of it, and Islamic teachings encourage us to worship as if we were going to die tomorrow - this way, we can prioritize and fully appreciate our time. Habib Ja’far ultimately argues that the true definition of time is its impact on our consciousness, and we should not simply measure it through heartbeats or seconds.

00:25:00
In this section, Habib Ja'far discusses the importance of time in terms of its meaning and significance rather than just the amount of time one has. He gives the examples of Gus Dur and Sunan Ampel, who after their passing, still give life to those around them through their charitable works and support for UMKM. Habib Ja'far notes that time is an enigma and that the concept of time within religious texts is meant to indict people's concepts of time, with texts like the story of Ashabul Kahfi, and Lailatul Qadr. Habib Ja'far believes that the task at hand is to guide one's time towards achieving an authentic existence, as time is ultimately more valuable than just the ticking of one's watch.

00:30:00
In this section, Habib Ja'far explores the concept of time and its significance in spiritual practices within Islam. He discusses the idea of "blessed time", which refers to the authenticity of time and its meaning in one's life. He gives an example of his mother who was able to complete all her daily chores by the end of the day without any modern tools. He then emphasizes that in Islam, people are supposed to control time rather than being controlled by it through a variety of rituals such as prayer, fasting, and pilgrimage. He further explains the importance of prioritization of time and how one should not be controlled by it.

00:35:00
In this section, Habib Ja’far discusses the philosophy of time in Islam and how it is important to control time instead of being controlled by it. He explains that time is ours, not something outside of us, and that controlling time is a part of spiritual practice. However, he also notes that the scientific exploration of time in terms of its relativity is not fully explored in Islamic thought. He highlights the importance of not just theological knowledge but scientific knowledge as well and suggests that scientists should not be excluded from religious communities. He argues that scientists can also contribute to religious discourse and be considered knowledgeable figures in religion.

00:40:00
In this section, Habib Ja’far discusses the importance of exploring science in a comprehensive way, including philosophy, spirituality, and science itself to understand time fully. He uses the Isra Mi'raj of Prophet Muhammad as an example of the revolution in our awareness of time and space. Habib Ja’far also highlights the issues of miscommunication and misunderstanding, particularly in social media, where people argue without agreeing on the definitions of the terms they debate. He argues that people need to be communicative and understanding to have fruitful conversations.

00:45:00
In this section, Habib Ja'far discusses the concept of time preference or preferensi waktu in economics, which refers to the tendency for people to prioritize immediate consumption over long-term investments. He argues that this is due to a lack of spiritualization of time, which is related to broader structural issues in society, such as a lack of investment capacity and overconsumption. Ja'far suggests that the Islamic tradition of zuhud or prioritizing the afterlife over the present world can serve as a model for addressing these issues and developing a more balanced approach to time and investment.

00:50:00
In this section, Habib Jafar talks about the importance of living in the present and not allowing wealth to consume one's thoughts and heart. He emphasizes the need for a vision that focuses on both the present and the afterlife, as this life is just part of the journey towards the next. Jafar advocates for the pursuit of wealth but with the mindset of zuhud, keeping in mind that the money earned should not come from haram sources and that it should be used for beneficial purposes. He also stresses the importance of not hoarding wealth and instead sharing it with others to foster a sense of togetherness and unity.

00:55:00
In this section, Habib Ja'far emphasizes the importance of starting everything with a clear and conscientious mindset, whether as a Muslim or a religious person. He argues that one's consciousness or Nurani is part of the heart, and rationality or akal is also a part of it. Consequently, one must avoid being instrumental and purely rational. Ja'far also shares a story about a wealthy person he once taught Arabic, who paid him IDR 2 million ($140) per month, but later offered him IDR 8 million ($561) to teach his pet dog. The story highlights the fact that people often disregard their consciousness or Nurani and, instead, value and invest in arbitrary or meaningless things.

01:00:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the idea of making existential decisions and finding meaning in one's life choices. The speaker emphasizes the importance of focusing on one's purpose and vision rather than being preoccupied with physical infrastructure, such as having an office or a designated workspace. The focus should be on creating a space for discussion and discourse that is not tied to a specific physical location, but rather on loyalty and commitment to a larger, overarching vision or goal. This means considering the bigger picture and focusing on building and sustaining a strong, meaningful foundation.

01:05:00
In this section, Habib Ja’far emphasizes the importance of having a clear goal and vision, and the need to focus on achieving it. He gives examples of how being distracted by other things can lead to losing sight of one’s goals, and how in Islam, being focused and oriented towards achieving one’s objectives is highly valued. He also stresses that being focused on achieving a goal does not require a fancy or elaborate infrastructure, and that as long as it does not hinder or hamper the pursuit of the goal, it is not important.

01:10:00
In this section, audience members ask Habib Ja'far questions on various topics such as relationships, education, legacy, and communication across different beliefs. Habib stresses the importance of understanding time and space in our education system, and listeners inquire about the continuation of Gus Dur's ideas and the influence of different ideologies. Another audience member asks about how to communicate with friends of different beliefs on sensitive topics such as violence against women and the wearing of hijabs. Habib emphasizes the need for mutual respect and understanding without offending one another.

01:15:00
In this section, Habib Ja’far discusses the concept of time and the philosophical perspective on the existence of human civilization in the universe. He addresses the idea that human beings may be the last civilization in the cosmos and may be a remnant of the universe's existence. Moreover, he emphasizes the importance of expanding our perspective from a global to a cosmic scale to solve fundamental issues on earth like poverty, education, and health. Habib also acknowledges the criticism of monotheism in light of humanity's long history, but he did not state his position on what evolution of religion will occur in the future.

01:20:00
In this section, Habib Ja'far talks about his personal experiences and views regarding the Indonesian education system. He believes that Indonesia's education system focuses too much on competitiveness rather than collaboration, which goes against the idea that God created individuals to collaborate instead of compete. Habib Ja'far argues that everyone has their unique characteristics and purpose, and education should aim to help students discover and actualize their uniqueness instead of treating them like robots. He suggests that instead of standardizing education, it should allow students to find themselves, internalize their uniqueness, and actualize themselves, thus creating a complete and perfect world.

01:25:00
In this section, Habib Ja'far challenges the term "orang berkebutuhan khusus" and suggests using "orang berkemampuan khusus" instead. He argues that everyone is unique and has their own special abilities, but we have our own standards of what is considered normal. He believes that instead of comparing ourselves to others, we should focus on realizing our full potential and using the gifts that God has given us. He warns against losing oneself in the pursuit of emulating others and emphasizes the importance of self-actualization. He concludes that looking in the mirror and recognizing oneself is crucial to avoiding the loss of identity.

01:30:00
In this section, Habib Ja'far discusses the importance of improving oneself beyond just physical appearance but also character and intellect. He highlights the need for individuals to fill their short lives with meaningful endeavors and to prioritize discussing substantial ideas with those who have different viewpoints but the same level of intellectual understanding. Habib Ja'far emphasizes that to ensure a productive discussion or exchange of ideas, one must distinguish between discussing universal and symbolic concepts, rather than focusing on identities or beliefs. He stresses the significance of developing universal ideas from Quran verses and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad to cater to people from different religions or backgrounds.

01:35:00
In this section, Habib Ja'far discusses the importance of focusing on developing oneself as a human being first, regardless of religious or political beliefs. He goes on to talk about the concept of time and how there is no real knowledge that can be gained from knowing whether we are in the beginning, middle or end of time. Habib Ja'far gives examples of how the dominance of science in the past few centuries has led to crises in various aspects of life due to its egoistic nature. Overall, he encourages individuals to focus on personal growth and not worry about the length of time we have left in the world.

01:40:00
In this section, Habib Ja'far, a Muslim scholar, talks about the significance of the concept of time and its interpretation by a scientist and a spiritual leader. He also hints at the upcoming series of videos on religion and its future in the face of various challenges such as economic recession, ecological crisis, atheism, secularism, and terrorism. Furthermore, he emphasizes the importance of understanding religion not merely as a part of one's identity but as a substance of one's being. He believes that if we grasp the true essence of religion, it will always serve as a sacred space of peace and tranquility for humanity.

01:45:00

01:50:00
In this section, various individuals ask Habib Ja'far questions about topics such as effective communication of knowledge, the portrayal of Islam in the media, the value of time and productivity, and the importance of teaching children about religious dialogue.

He also encourages individuals to prioritize time in a way that benefits their well-being and not to get caught up in the pressure of being constantly busy. Additionally, he emphasizes the need to teach children about religious dialogue and the importance of understanding and respecting differences in beliefs.

01:55:00
In this section, Habib Ja'far discusses the importance of developing an open-minded generation through dialogues about religion.

However, Habib emphasizes the importance of dialogue about religion in schools as it can help to create a more inclusive and informed society. Additionally, he addresses the issue of finding appropriate resources to educate children about history and religion, which can be challenging for parents and teachers alike. Habib also highlights the need to break down the concept of gender roles and to acknowledge the importance and contribution of women in society, especially during natural disasters. Finally, he stresses the significance of dialogue with people who hold different viewpoints to foster understanding, rather than avoiding it due to authority or differences in opinion.

02:00:00
In this section, Habib Ja'far addresses the question of how to activate consciousness and what parameters exist to determine whether consciousness is active. He emphasizes the importance of activating consciousness in order to create personal and public policies that are not just semantic but also substantial. Additionally, he explains that despite the fast-paced nature of life, it is still possible to slow down and appreciate the meaningful changes and movements that occur in life. He also answers questions about how to maintain analytical thinking, ethics, and morals in the face of different pressures from society. Finally, he tackles the question of what was Allah's intention in creating humans and why they are unique compared to other species, and encourages further discussion and exploration of this topic.

02:05:00
In this section of the video, Habib Ja'far discusses the importance of searching for common ground in terms of substance rather than identity when it comes to religion and citizenship. He emphasizes that identity can remain a private matter, while substance should be discussed and fought for in public spaces. Habib also touches on the need for a shift in perspective when it comes to the portrayal of Prophet Muhammad in history books, suggesting that more attention should be given to his ethics and compassion rather than his role in battles. Habib notes that the majority of the Prophet's life was focused on compassion and ethics, and that even during times of war, the perspective should be on the importance of ethics and compassion.

02:10:00
In this section, Habib Ja’far discusses the tendency of humans to find pleasure in the suffering of others, which is a problem that exists in various civilizations. He refers to a German word that explains this phenomenon, and how even the English have been criticized for their tendency to find pleasure in the misfortune of others. Ja’far refers to a recent study from a laboratory in Germany that found that people in general seem to be happiest when they see others fail. He then discusses how this type of behavior goes against the teachings of the prophet Muhammad, who treated prisoners of war with great respect, even feeding them himself. Ja’far concludes that feelings of offense are partly due to education or lack thereof, and that learning to respect others regardless of their beliefs or circumstances is crucial.

02:15:00
In this section, Habib Ja'far talks about the importance of prioritizing values like kindness and respect, and how they affect our interactions with others. He explains that being offended or upset by someone's words or actions is often due to how it is said, rather than what is said.

Habib Ja'far encourages people to prioritize harmony and tolerance, which will allow us to work together to address the challenges we face.

02:20:00
In this section, Habib Ja’far talks about the importance of taking personal responsibility and being accountable for one's actions. He believes that blaming one's environment for problems is an issue of upbringing, where people are not taught to be sovereign individuals. Habib Ja'far argues that the key to preventing accidents and problems in life is to act with responsibility and accountability, which includes being cautious about how one expresses opinions online. He emphasizes the importance of contextualizing knowledge and communicating in a language that the audience can understand to ensure successful dua (religious outreach). Habib Ja’far believes that successful religious scholars are modern, able to contextualize knowledge, and communicate in a language that the ordinary person can relate to.

02:25:00
In this section, Habib Ja’far discusses the importance of simplifying philosophical thoughts and making them accessible to the average person using analogies and relatable language. He emphasizes the value of using one's intellectual ability to uplift and empower others rather than just giving material wealth. He also talks about the importance of understanding context and the language of the community in which one is speaking. Habib Ja’far cites the example of Saidah Maryam in the Quran, who faced accusations of having a child outside of wedlock and was advised to not waste energy trying to clarify the rumors, as those who love and support her do not need clarification, and those who don't will not listen to the truth anyway.

02:30:00
In this section, Habib Ja'far talks about the fallacy of equating busyness with effectiveness and the mistaken notion of measuring one's usefulness based on their physical activity. He shares that he has reduced his offline lectures and has found more effectiveness in his online talks, which have been viewed by hundreds of thousands of people. Habib Ja'far emphasizes the importance of focusing on meaning instead of physical activity, and points out that many people who appear to be successful entrepreneurs often have little actual activity. He argues that true entrepreneurship can be symbolically demonstrated by farmers or fishermen who work hard physically. Lastly, he touches on the importance of introducing children to religion and the need for them to choose their faith, rather than accepting the religion of their family as a given.

02:35:00
In this section, Habib Ja'far talks about the idea that we do not truly own our children, but rather they are entrusted to us by God, and our task as parents is to help them realize their potential, not to impose our own dreams and desires on them. He also discusses his views on gender roles, emphasizing the importance and dignity of being a homemaker, as well as the capacity of women to be powerful agents of change and activism. Ja'far stresses the need for reflection and self-awareness to avoid going through life on autopilot and missing the deeper meaning and purpose of our daily experiences.

02:40:00
In this section, Habib Ja'far emphasizes the importance of taking time for meditation and reflection, especially in the midst of a busy and crowded environment. He notes that some people only realize the presence of God in places of worship or during crowded events, but this is not true spirituality. He encourages people to grow in consciousness and to not just follow the crowd mindlessly, but to instead strive for individual growth even if it means going against the grain. Habib Ja'far also discusses the need to be able to blend in with society while maintaining one's core beliefs, stating that Islam is like a clear glass that can blend with different colors without losing its own identity. Finally, he encourages people to have friendships across different religions in order to strengthen their own beliefs and to potentially positively influence others.

02:45:00
In this section, Habib Ja'far talks about the concept of darkness in philosophy and states that darkness doesn't exist ontologically, but is merely the absence of light. He also answers a question about why God created humans, stating that it is due to God's love and mercy, and that humans are not all-knowing like God, hence why we are created to gain knowledge and understanding. The talk includes a philosophical discussion about God's creation of humans and Al Farabi's theory, but Habib Ja'far notes that it's a complex topic to discuss in the limited time available during the session.
