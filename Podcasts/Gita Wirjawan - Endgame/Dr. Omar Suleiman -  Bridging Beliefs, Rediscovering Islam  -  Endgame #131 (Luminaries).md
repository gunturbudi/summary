Detail Summary:

In this section, Dr. Omar Suleiman talks about his childhood and his Palestinian refugee parents' unique journeys to the United States. He was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, which didn't have many Muslims. His father, who was born in a free Palestine, went around the world in search of education and became a distinguished chemistry professor, while his mother came from a royal Palestinian family and had an open spirituality growing up. The importance of family is also discussed, as Dr. Omar emphasizes that the breakdown of humanity reflects on the breakdown of family and how family has been deprioritized in our discourse.

00:05:00
In this section of the interview, Dr. Omar Suleiman talks about his upbringing in Louisiana and how his parents were deeply humanitarian and connected to every cause globally and locally. His father was a distinguished professor in analytical chemistry and built the best laboratory in the entire South at Southern University, which was a historically black college, and his mother was a poet who wrote about all oppressed people around the world. Despite coming from a place they didn't experience firsthand, Palestine, they recognized their responsibility and duty to the place. Additionally, in the background of all of this was his mother's struggle with cancer, which took a toll on Suleiman as a child.

00:10:00
In this section, Dr. Omar Suleiman talks about his childhood experiences when his mother was in a coma for 14 days due to cancer treatment. He struggled to understand why his parents, who were the best people in the world, were going through this plight, and became very angry, lashing out as a young child. He found an escape in sports, playing every sport he could, and growing from 5-foot-4 to 6-foot-2 when he was just 12 years old. He also found solace in religious and philosophical conversations, jumping into discussions with his dad, who commanded respect as a peacemaker in the community. He even began reading both the Quran and Bible with his childhood friend, Joshua, and attending Saturday morning breakfast groups to discuss religion and spirituality, and this eventually led him to rediscover Islam.

00:15:00
In this section of the video, Dr. Omar Suleiman shares the story of how he and his friend Joshua (now Yusuf) embraced Islam together and became a "dawah team," converting many of their schoolmates to Islam. Yusuf became a member of Dr. Suleiman's household and was treated like family, even after Dr. Suleiman's mother passed away. Despite the challenges of pursuing Islamic studies during the post-9/11 era, Dr. Suleiman was able to study in the United Arab Emirates and continue his independent academic pursuit of Islam alongside his accounting degree.

00:20:00
In this section, Dr. Omar Suleiman talks about his experience pursuing religious education in Malaysia and his love for the people and culture of the country. He also addresses the topic of the misunderstanding and misinterpretation of Islam, which he believes stems from intentionally removing it from the realm of theology and religion and associating it with foreignness, domination, and scare tactics. He highlights the beauty and appeal of the theology of Islam, which unifies the messages brought by all the prophets and promotes the idea of monotheism.

00:25:00
In this section, Dr. Omar Suleiman discusses how negative perceptions of Islam and Muslims have been propagated and manipulated to create a culture of Islamophobia. He explains how Hollywood and the 9/11 attacks led to a deep fascination with Islam, which was manipulated by hate groups that were founded with neutral-sounding names. These groups were able to propagate extremist views about Islam through think tanks and their Ph.D.-holding members, who were actually pure bigots. This bigotry led to a surveillance culture and a policy implication, where Muslims were looked upon with suspicion and weren't fully welcomed at any table. The Muslim community was seen as a political entity that could be used for or against, and some groups embraced diversity but hated everything about Islam.

00:30:00
In this section, Dr. Omar Suleiman discusses how Muslims have been expected to conform to a domesticated version where they can show up but not share their ideas or religion. He suggests that Muslims must speak up about their faith and undo the misconceptions that society has about their community. By starting with the fundamentals and sharing their story from the start, Muslims can inform their allies and those on the fence about their religion. He believes that welcoming conversations with non-Muslims will lead to more understanding and less fear-mongering. Additionally, he notes that more people are embracing Islam during and after the COVID era because they are searching for deeper meaning and finding it in Islam.

00:35:00
In this section, Dr. Omar Suleiman discusses why it is not easy to convey the message of peace to the rest of the world, despite the fact that there are 1.8 billion Muslims who share the same idea. He explains that social media is a huge factor, as people are increasingly basing their worldviews on customized algorithms that are meant to polarize and paralyze them. This makes it difficult to get the true message of Islam out there and penetrate someone's worldview enough to make them take a step back and learn about Islam from Muslims. However, in-person interactions can quickly complicate someone's worldview, and the Quran calls us to start with people on the basis of similarity to effectively convey the message of peace.

00:40:00
In this section of the interview, Dr. Omar Suleiman talks about how interfaith dialogues can help build bridges between different religions. He emphasizes the importance of finding common ground and starting with a shared understanding, rather than trying to force a particular theological mold on others. He urges people to focus on conveying their message instead of conversion, and insists that treating others with respect and dignity is a prophetic way of life. He believes in the power of social justice and positive actions to create goodwill and promote understanding between different communities.

00:45:00
In this section, Dr. Omar Suleiman discusses the impact of Islam on the world throughout history. He highlights how Islam not only brought a theology but also scientific inquiry, ethics, and social order. He argues that while the current Muslim world faces issues like political and cultural destruction, it is not a failure of religion or the Prophet Muhammad. He encourages Muslims to rediscover the beauty of Islam and its universal ideas of service and goodness to demonstrate the superior value of its beliefs to others. Furthermore, he emphasizes the potency of the message brought by the Prophet Muhammad and the need to stick to the unique value of Islam and its framework. Finally, he explains how the idea of one God was objectionable to the Meccan elites because it challenged their ability to exploit people in the name of their idols, and that La Ilaha Illallah should be interpreted in a manner that eradicates manipulation and humiliation of people.

00:50:00
In this section of the video, Dr. Omar Suleiman discusses how the concept of one God in Islam levels the playing field for everyone. It eliminates any superiority of one person over another based on their background or race, and instead creates a pursuit of God's pleasure. This message is threatening to tyrants who rely on exploitation, but it has appealed to revolutionary movements throughout history. Dr. Suleiman then goes on to discuss his admiration for Malcolm X's sincerity, growth, integrity, and willingness to admit where he was wrong.

00:55:00
In this section, Dr. Omar Suleiman discusses his admiration for Malcolm X and how his sincerity and constant growth have inspired him to not be driven by obstacles to a convenient theology and worldview that fit his obstacles, but to constantly seek the truth. He believes that Malcolm X is the most articulate truth speaker that America has ever seen, and his speeches stood out because he spoke from a place of experience and authenticity. Dr. Suleiman draws a distinction between himself and famous athletes like Muhammad Ali and Khabib Nurmagomedov and explains that while they have used their platform for Islam and the world, Ali was a pioneer in making the greatest sacrifice and using his platform to make a positive impact during the most difficult circumstances.

01:00:00
In this section, Dr. Omar Suleiman talks about the impact that Muslim athletes such as Muhammad Ali and Khabib Nurmagomedov have had in representing the beauty of Islam in their lives and careers, conveying the message of peace to the world in just a few sentences. He expresses his wish for more individuals like them to convey Islam's message to the world. The conversation then shifts to the alarming fact that despite Muslims being 23-24% of the world population, they make up only 5% of the global economy. Dr. Suleiman sees this as a result of multiple factors, including the lack of unity within Muslims, and emphasizes the importance of "ummatic" thinking to bring the ummah together and collectively elevate all of humanity.

01:05:00
In this section, Dr. Omar Suleiman discusses the responsibility of successful Muslims to give back to their ummah and incentivize others to do the same, in order to uplift the Muslim population as a whole. He argues that this requires an ideological and philosophical component, as well as a focus on institutional thinking and succession planning. He emphasizes the need to create a culture that encourages successful Muslims to train and mentor the next generation of Muslim leaders and entrepreneurs, and to amplify stories of those who have used their success to be a blessing to others. He also notes the political motivations behind many of the frictions that exist within the Muslim world and expresses concern about the decreasing quality of leadership, especially as social media polarizes and complicates conversations.

01:10:00
In this section, Dr. Omar Suleiman talks about his hope for the future and the potential for those who come from harsh circumstances to create change. He believes that there are people who can rise to the top through grit and hard work, particularly those who have come out of refugee camps and occupations. He cites the example of Rahaf, a 16-year-old Syrian refugee who wants to become a lawyer to sue Bashar al-Assad for war crimes. Suleiman sees her as an example of the brilliance generated in people under harsh circumstances. He believes that if these people can be given the tools to succeed, they could create the next generation of institutional and ummatic upliftment. The conversation then shifts to the topic of normalization with Israel, and Suleiman believes that public opinion is changing on Israel, particularly in the West where pro-Palestinian solidarity amongst young people is growing.

01:15:00
In this section, Dr. Omar Suleiman discusses his opposition to the Abraham Accords and asserts that Muslim countries that normalize relations with Israel while ignoring the oppression of Palestinian people are participating in their dehumanization and oppression. He calls the Abraham Accords nothing but apartheid and arms deals and that they function to give Israel access to power and a lack of accountability. Despite this, Suleiman has hope in the resilience and determination of the Palestinian people and calls upon Muslims everywhere to put pressure on their governments to hold Israel accountable, stating that the BDS movement is the only strategy that can work. He also speaks of the tremendous solidarity that is expressed by people in countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and Algeria towards the Palestinian cause.

01:20:00
In this section, Dr. Omar Suleiman discusses the unifying cause of Palestine for the Muslim ummah and the impact of the normalization of relations between Morocco and Israel. He believes that Palestine is in the hearts of most Muslims around the world and can bring people together due to the blatant injustice in the region. Dr. Suleiman also criticizes the Abraham Accords, which he believes sell to the innocent who see unity without understanding the political situation. He emphasizes that the liberation of Palestine is crucial to the Palestinian people and highlights the solidarity shown by protesters in Indonesia and Malaysia.

01:25:00
In this section, Dr. Omar Suleiman emphasized that it is not the responsibility of the oppressed to come up with a solution when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He explained that the language of peace is often used to suffocate the voices for justice and that a two-state solution and peace talks don't make sense anymore because it's always been hung over the heads of Palestinians. Instead, Dr. Omar Suleiman thinks that it's a joke, and the pressure should be put on Israel to give everyone equal rights as Palestine is experiencing land confiscation, ethnic cleansing under occupation, and humiliation. Therefore, he believes that freedom must be insisted on and explained that liberation never depends on the oppressor to recognize their wrongdoing, but it should come through pressure like the BDS movement.

01:30:00
In this section, Dr. Omar Suleiman discusses the importance of putting pressure on oppressors to stop their harmful actions. He mentions the economic, social, and political pressures that can create change, citing the example of the BDS movement, which has faced backlash but continues to apply pressure to Israel. Dr. Suleiman emphasizes the need for Palestinians to resist through their existence and refusal to be silenced, as well as for supporters to never be intimidated. He also proposes boycotting Israeli dates and other small actions collectively as a way of showing solidarity. The conversation then shifts to the topic of artificial intelligence, with Dr. Suleiman emphasizing the importance of using technology for good and not losing our humanity in the process.

01:35:00
In this section, Dr. Omar Suleiman expresses his concerns regarding the ethical considerations associated with the rise of artificial intelligence. Suleiman urges people to craft the ethics of artificial intelligence now, insisting that certain functions of humanity must remain human. If everything is delegated to artificial intelligence, we are setting ourselves up for a world in which people cannot distinguish between truth and falsehood and between human and inhumane. Suleiman emphasizes the need to neutralize harm and see what can be used for good, trying to make the inevitable beneficial and neutralizing harms. He also reflects on the importance of family and motherhood, highlighting that the breakdown of humanity reflects the breakdown of family. Suleiman insists that family should be prioritized again and that men and women should educate themselves and think beyond themselves.

01:40:00
In this section of the video, Dr. Omar Suleiman highlights the importance of finding inspiration from the stories of the past, particularly in the biographies of the generation of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. He emphasizes the need to humanize historical figures to see our full human potential and become better versions of ourselves. He also stresses the importance of a collective mindset, insisting on family and community, and pushing back against individualism to fight for equitable treatment of all, including marginalized groups like the elderly, the vulnerable, the poor, and the homeless. Finally, he recounts his experiences with Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and how it gives him a spiritual connection with the Indonesian people who went through the devastation of the tsunami.

01:45:00
In this section, Dr. Omar Suleiman reflects on the solidarity felt among people during the period following Hurricane Katrina and the tsunami in Indonesia in 2004. He remembers struggling to relate to the devastation in Indonesia, but felt a stronger connection after witnessing the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina just months later. Dr. Omar Suleiman expresses his gratitude for the opportunity to meet people in Indonesia and his hope for protection for them. The video ends with gratitude and recognition of his credentials as the founder of the Yaqeen Institute and Professor of Islamic Studies at Southern Methodist University.
