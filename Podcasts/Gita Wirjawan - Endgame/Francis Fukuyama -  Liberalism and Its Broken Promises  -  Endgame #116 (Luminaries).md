Political scientist Francis Fukuyama discusses a wide range of topics related to liberalism, democracy, and the challenges faced by democratic societies in his interview with Endgame #116 (Luminaries). Fukuyama explains that while liberal democracy is the best option, the rise of populist politicians like Donald Trump has contributed to the decline of democracy, weakening democratic institutions. Fukuyama remains optimistic that the U.S. can overcome this democratic recession by continuing to uphold the rule of law and promoting a sense of civic responsibility among citizens. However, the democratization of ideas brought about by social media has led to anyone being able to say anything they want, including things that are not true or hateful, leading to polarization and indecisive information. Additionally, Fukuyama discusses the negative consequences of neoliberalism and how it led to unregulated capitalism and financial crises, as large corporations dominated and prevented competition from startups. Finally, Fukuyama highlights the threats to liberalism in various systems which are not symmetrical from the left and right in many countries.

Detail Summary:

In this section, Professor Francis Fukuyama discusses how autonomy is often pursued for its own sake, without thought to what it will be used for, which he sees as a problem for liberalism. He talks about his upbringing and how he was introduced to Western philosophy and politics through thinkers like Hegel and Karl Marx. Fukuyama also talks about the evolution of democracy and how in recent years, there has been a democratic recession as well as the rise of undemocratic movements in countries like India and the United States. Finally, Fukuyama explains that his book "The End of History" was more about the evolution of human societies than a terminal event.

In this section of the video, Francis Fukuyama discusses the idea that elites should run things rather than relying on democratic choice. He argues that while democratic choice does not always lead to positive outcomes, selecting an alternative system is difficult because elites are self-interested and would prioritize protecting their privilege and position. Moreover, democratic systems need to be open to broader choice to have a government that has a broad public interest in mind. Fukuyama explains that a liberal democracy, including constitutional checks and balances, is the best option as it prevents a single leader from doing too much damage. However, the rise of populist politicians like Donald Trump has contributed to the decline of democracy, weakening democratic institutions. Fukuyama remains optimistic that the U.S. can overcome this democratic recession by continuing to uphold the rule of law and promoting a sense of civic responsibility among citizens.

00:10:00
In this section, political scientist Francis Fukuyama discusses the disadvantages of authoritarian government and how both Russia and China have been putting out the narrative that liberal democracy is in decline. Fukuyama argues that governments without checks and balances are capable of making huge mistakes, and he cites Putin's isolation during the pandemic as an example. Fukuyama predicts the defeat of the Russian army in Ukraine, but he hesitates to make real predictions about how things will unfold in the coming years. He also speculates that authoritarian failures sometimes lead to riskier behavior and greater risks.

00:15:00
In this section, Fukuyama explains the three arguments in favor of liberalism: pragmatic, moral, and economic, where liberalism originated to manage diversity in societies; individual autonomy is based on people's ability to choose freely, and respect for individuals is important; and liberalism protects private property and the right to transact allowing for the prosperity of liberal societies. Fukuyama then discusses how relativism of autonomy undermines people's ability to live within a moral framework and how neoliberalism should be used to designate an interpretation of economic liberalism rather than capitalism as such.

00:20:00
In this section, Francis Fukuyama discusses the downsides of neoliberalism and its effects on the global economy. He argues that although the idea of liberalizing the state had some merit, it was taken too far, resulting in unregulated capitalism and financial crises. Fukuyama believes that markets should have been democratized further, but many countries still struggle to provide SME finance, leaving small and medium-sized businesses with limited access to global capital. Additionally, he notes that neoliberalism led to an attack on antitrust policies, allowing large corporations to dominate and prevent competition from startups.

00:25:00
In this section, political scientist Francis Fukuyama explains that the threats to liberalism are not symmetrical from the left and right in many countries. Right-wing populist movements that oppose immigration and aim to protect the ethnic characteristics of their society have been on the rise in many parts of the world, while left-wing populists tend to focus on economic inequality and seek to redistribute wealth. When it comes to limiting the power of dominant corporations, Fukuyama notes that Europe has been more active in competition policy than the United States. However, he acknowledges the political difficulty in passing antitrust policies in the US, as politicians are divided on this issue and the Republican party is financially backed by large corporations.

In this section, Francis Fukuyama and the interviewer discuss the issue of polarization brought about by social media and its effect on the democratization of ideas. Francis argues that the democratization of ideas is not the solution to the problem because it has led to anyone being able to say anything they want, including things that are not true or hateful, and the internet has concentrated the power to amplify or silence these views. He proposes that more elite control over the promulgation of information is needed, and while the government cannot be trusted to be the arbiters of truth, leaving it to platforms might not work either since they have the wrong incentives. Moreover, allowing single wealthy individuals to dominate the political conversation can put democracy at risk.

00:35:00
In this section, Fukuyama discusses the danger of relying solely on big platforms to limit misinformation and conspiracy theories from spreading, as they may have their own interests in amplifying popular content rather than quality information. He also expresses his worry about how celebrity and sensationalization rather than thoughtful policy positions may become the norm in future elections around the world. Additionally, he comments on the need for India to preserve a liberal society that offers equal opportunities to people of all faiths, rather than just being based on Hindu nationalism pushed by Prime Minister Modi, and the importance for the United States to keep out right-wing politicians like Trump.

00:40:00
In this section, Francis Fukuyama and David Li discuss the challenges facing Indonesia as a democracy, including corruption and illiberal forces of Muslim extremism. While Indonesia has made progress towards establishing democratic institutions after decades of dictatorship, corruption remains pervasive and democracy has simply spread out the nature of corruption. Additionally, illiberal political forces threaten to impose an intolerant version of religion, which must be beaten back to preserve the country's commitment to a liberal society. David Li believes that Southeast Asia's economic growth has been hindered by corruption, lack of infrastructure, education, and competition, and that the application of technological innovations could boost productivity and lead to more economic growth in the region. However, Fukuyama notes that China's growth model of massive investment in real estate is unsustainable and has fallen below the regional average in economic growth.

00:45:00
In this section, Fukuyama discusses how human societies have historically been based on patronage and clientalism, rather than merit. He uses China as an example of a society that has emphasized education and meritocracy in selecting its leaders. Fukuyama argues that encouraging a similar cultural emphasis on education is essential for promoting merit-based selection. He also refutes the claim that developed Western societies are selecting talent more based on patronage and loyalty, citing the success of Asian immigrants in higher education in the United States as an example of meritocracy remaining a powerful force. However, he does note that economic and social advantages tend to perpetuate meritocracy, posing the real threat to meritocracy in the United States.

00:50:00
In this section, Francis Fukuyama discusses the state of democracy in Singapore and whether it's considered a thriving democracy or not. Fukuyama believes that Singapore is a thriving liberal state, but not a democracy because it doesn't permit fully free and fair elections nor true freedom of speech. While Singaporeans disagree with this statement, they do acknowledge that their government reflects the wishes of the people. When asked about the role of artificial intelligence on democracy, Fukuyama mentions that technology is morally neutral and can be used for good or bad purposes. He cites China's social credit system as an example of a technology that can be used for both surveillance and control, which has never been seen before in any society.

00:55:00
In this section, Francis Fukuyama discusses the impact of technology on democracy. While technology can potentially augment the intellect of many individuals, it can also have an adverse effect by relieving individuals of the need to educate themselves, reducing incentives to develop intellectual capacities and ultimately making people "stupider." Fukuyama believes that biotech is potentially more dangerous than information technology as it has the ability to alter human nature. However, living in a liberal democracy allows individuals to mobilize, criticize, and suggest ways to improve society, making it a valuable aspect of living in a democratic society compared to a dictatorship.
