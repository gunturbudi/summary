In this section, Sabrang Mowo Damar Panuluh and Gita Wirjawan discuss the dangers of genetic manipulation and social engineering. Sabrang voices his concern over the potential for the wealthy to use CRISPR technology to prolong their lives and become immortal, further exacerbating elitism. He argues that education should be focused on problem-solving rather than producing graduates, as the latter has led to a corrupted educational system and a broken cycle of higher education. Sabrang also touches on the topic of AI, acknowledging that while it has the potential to disrupt and hack civilization, it also has the ability to positively impact communication and interfacing between humans and machines.

In this section, the speaker discusses the impact of AI on communication and trust in society. Trust distribution is essential for society's stability, and it is built through communication. However, with the intervention of machines, communication may become artificial, and hence, the community may lose trust in each other. There is a possibility that the development of AI may disrupt society's construction, but the recent developments in production journals and codes provide hope. Chat GPT is an example of a trend in "multi-modality," where people use more than one mode of communication, making it challenging to halt the wave of technology's advancement. The speaker compares the situation to Freud's term "ego," where natural tendencies clash with societal norms and beliefs, leading to a potentially dangerous scenario.

00:10:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the strong influence of technology in serving one's Id rather than Superego, making it difficult to resist. However, one approach is to have a high level of consciousness of the situation. The speaker proposes that LLM technology, which has been successful in language preservation, can be used to preserve Indonesia's 600 languages and biodiversity. The challenge is to find a way to overcome economic and infrastructure obstacles in using LLM. Despite the effectiveness of LLM in preserving language, the speaker emphasizes that the amount of data cannot be equated with the population, as the internet platforms were historically provided by the US, and their data centers are located there.

00:15:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the challenges of AI research in Indonesia. He explains that while there are many opportunities to harness the power of AI, efforts are hindered by the lack of patience and investment in the country. He also raises the question of how Indonesia can use AI wisely in the future, pointing out the possibility of a dystopian future where all decisions are made by machines. He suggests that AI could be utilized to offer more objective decisions in the realm of law, but the challenge is getting society to accept this kind of technology.

00:20:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the role of AI in decision-making, including its potential use in surveys, politics and the concept of "fluid democracy". The speaker also suggests that AI could assist individuals in making decisions and provide more accurate sentiment analysis by analyzing vast amounts of data. While the speaker acknowledges the potential for AI to be used in a positive manner, they warn against the dangers of monopoly in the AI space and urge caution as we navigate the complex history and economic implications of AI technologies.

00:25:00
In this section, the speakers discuss the potential impact of emerging technologies and the importance of managing resources effectively. They highlight the danger of a widening gap between countries that have access to advanced technology and those that don't, as well as the potential for disparities within countries to increase. However, they also suggest that this trend can be mitigated by making use of a country's existing resources and implementing effective governance strategies. They also emphasize the importance of selecting leaders based on merit rather than loyalty or patronage, citing examples from both history and the present day.

00:30:00
In this section, the speaker emphasizes the importance of loyalty to one's values as a defining characteristic of humanity and how this value relates to the core values of a company. The speaker also discusses the concept of integrity and how it relates to an individual's values. In addition, the speaker explores the idea of distributing power and resources as significant aspects of a functioning democracy, drawing upon examples from countries such as Singapore. The speaker notes that Indonesia's diversity presents challenges in accomplishing this, but ultimately, the solution lies in trusting others.

00:35:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the importance of having a pillar of knowledge represented by professors in the democratic system. He acknowledges that current societal complexities make it difficult for individuals to make decisions, as there is no "reflector" of information available. By having a system in place that values and protects the independence of professors, like in the Roman Empire with Marcus Aurelius, society can benefit from a wealth of knowledge and insight that approaches politics with honesty and integrity. Without this pillar, the speaker fears that society's lack of ability to understand the complexities of the world will lead to a "kickback" in the long-term.

00:40:00
In this section, the speaker speaks about the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in the social sciences. While acknowledging that social science has limitations in making predictions compared to natural science, the speaker asserts that with a dynamic systems approach, AI can be utilized to make predictions about societal behavior that far surpass current capabilities. The speaker argues that AI can take subjectivity out of the equation and bring objectivity into the picture. In addition to the benefits of using AI in social science, the speaker also emphasizes the importance of human control over technology, much like how control is given to children based on their level of understanding. The speaker concludes that embracing AI in a controlled manner can provide significant benefits in areas like education and language preservation.

00:45:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the challenges of developing AI while having financial constraints in Indonesia. He mentions the existing tech mafia in Silicon Valley, which proves that technology can be easily emulated. However, the real challenge is the engineering aspect and the need for funding. The speaker provides examples of how a scarcity of resources can lead to creative solutions, citing the pen used by Russia's space program and the design of a German tank that balances weight and shield thickness. He stresses the importance of finding people with an intrinsic drive to solve problems and providing them with adequate funding without placing too many expectations on KPIs. The speaker questions the overemphasis on KPIs and argues that it could hinder creativity and innovation when choosing the right people for the job.

00:50:00
In this section, the speakers discuss the challenges of fostering innovation and creativity in Southeast Asian countries and how it relates to the issuance of permits. They note that while Southeast Asian countries have seen only a modest increase in per capita GDP, China has seen a significant gain due in part to its higher level of competitiveness. The speakers suggest that a lack of creativity and risk-taking among the population may contribute to the relatively low number of permits issued in the region. They also discuss how talent is difficult to manage and highlight the importance of creating a culture that encourages openness to new ideas. Despite concerns about the dangers of AI, the speakers remain optimistic and advocate for a positive and democratic approach to innovation.

00:55:00
In this section, the speaker discusses his vision for using technology and AI to provide access to knowledge and education to parents and their children in Indonesia. He believes that education begins in the home and that parents are responsible for instilling values, while schools provide knowledge. He also emphasizes the importance of critical thinking and the ability to ask questions, which can be developed and improved through access to collective human intelligence available through AI and technology. With proper education and brain training, IQ can be improved and increased fluidly.

01:00:00
In this section, the speakers discuss how imagination and abstract thinking can be improved through reading and using technology. They argue that with the rise of social media and short attention spans, it is becoming more difficult to cultivate a culture of reading. However, they suggest that the problem is not entirely negative, as people are still able to reconstruct knowledge from what they consume. They also discuss the need for information to be broken down into smaller, more accessible forms, such as web or graph knowledge, to allow for easier absorption. Overall, while technology presents new challenges for cultivating imagination, they suggest that there are still ways to improve abstract thinking through innovative methods of knowledge sharing.

01:05:00
In this section, the speaker explains the concept of learning with a purpose, which involves solving problems or learning something specific to achieve a goal. This type of learning is said to result in higher attention span and better absorption of knowledge due to intrinsic motivation. The speaker also mentions their research on how AI can help children with their homework without giving them answers, instead encouraging critical thinking and curiosity. The potential economic impact of AI is discussed, but the speaker highlights the importance of open-source and democratic access to mitigate the risk of elitism.

01:10:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the potential for genetic manipulation to create an elite class of humans who can live for hundreds of years. They also discuss the concept of mutual credit as a potential replacement for traditional currency in order to create a more equitable society. However, there are concerns about whether society can adapt to such a major change and the potential for technology to outpace emotional intelligence, leading to catastrophic consequences. In order to progress as a civilization, it is important for both cognitive and emotional intelligence to develop in tandem.

01:15:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the misinterpretation of religion, which is now viewed as a collection of rules rather than a set of values. He believes that religion should be focused on enhancing emotional intelligence and interacting with others. Furthermore, the speaker argues that emotional intelligence is just as important as cognitive intelligence. He believes that the ability to simulate someone else's reality is critical to emotional intelligence, and that being able to empathize with others is not only a cognitive ability but also a logical one.

01:20:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the concept of abductive reasoning and how it differs from inductive and deductive reasoning. He then talks about how everyone has different perspectives on what constitutes a "correct" answer, and how precision is dependent on the tools used to measure it. He also delves into a conversation about the H-1B visa program in the United States and how it favors individuals from India over China, despite the latter being arguably more skilled in the field of natural sciences. The speaker posits that the reason for this may be due to the advantage that Indians have in "branding" themselves through the skill of ngecap.

01:25:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the importance of communication and intelligence in learning and everyday life. He quotes Jordan Peterson and Richard Feynman in emphasizing the crucial role of communication in shaping one's thinking and learning process. He also shares his personal experience with public speaking and learning how to express oneself effectively from a young age. He notes that children today seem more expressive and articulate, but worries that repressive responses from adults could hinder their ability to communicate effectively in the future. The speaker stresses the need for Indonesians to develop their communication and critical thinking abilities to compete on a global scale with other nations, such as China and India.

01:30:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the importance of democratizing the opportunity to speak and express opinions. This can be achieved through various initiatives, such as creating platforms for children to speak and making speaking an attractive objective. The speaker also reflects on the issues of excessive affection and the need for meritocracy in universities. Additionally, the discussion delves into the significance of soft skills and the need to perfect both formal and informal structures. The speaker observes that Indian culture is open to various beliefs and sees it as an encouraging sign to help develop open-mindedness towards communication.

01:35:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the importance of communication skills and networking in society, particularly for those who want to climb the social and economic ladder. With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), there is a shift in language dominance, as many AI systems are based on the English language. However, the use of AI is not restricted to language skills and can have a positive impact on various fields, such as agriculture. The discussion ends with a comparison between the populations of China and India, with the potential for AI to be a tool for those wanting to improve their lives.

01:40:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the role of AI in the future of work in different countries. While AI may be a solution for countries with high unemployment rates, such as China, it may not be as beneficial for countries like India, with a large population. The speaker predicts that many blue-collar workers in Indonesia may be affected by AI, and proposes a strategy to upgrade them to positions that cannot be replaced by AI. The speaker also suggests that the preservation of language should be a priority for the government to ensure future generations are protected, regardless of the potential disruptions caused by AI. Finally, the speaker reminds the audience that our ultimate enemy is problems and challenges, not other people.
