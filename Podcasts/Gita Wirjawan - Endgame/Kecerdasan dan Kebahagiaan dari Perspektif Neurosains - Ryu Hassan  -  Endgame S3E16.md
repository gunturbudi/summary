In this video, neuroscientist Ryu Hassan discusses the idea that humans are able to progress and become happier thanks to advances in science and technology. However, he also points out that there is a tendency for humans to become disorderly and that it is up to the individual to fight against this entropy.
This video discusses how humans are at the mercy of entropy and how they can choose to fight against it instead of surrendering to it. It also discusses the importance of emotional intelligence and perspective, and how they can help us make sacrifices for the greater good.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Ryu Hassan was born in a religious family with autistic tendencies, and after completing high school, he started medical school. He quickly realized that medicine wasn't a science, but rather a technology that applied science. After graduating from medical school, he decided to become a neurosurgeon, and is now doing amazing work.

The speaker discusses how, as a person with rare allergies, he is picky about what he eats, and how this has helped him develop many hobbies. He goes on to say that, although it is important to read books, not everyone needs to do so. He finishes by discussing how society should get used to the idea that reading books is not mandatory for everyone.

00:10:00
This video discusses how practicing and being familiar with activities can lead to a higher level of happiness and well-being. It quotes psychologist Daniel Goleman, and refers to his book "Emotional Intelligence" which discusses how emotions play a crucial role in our lives. The video also discusses how one can increase his or her emotional intelligence by studying neuroscience, and how one of the pioneers of this field was Joseph LeDoux.

00:15:00
Daniel Goleman discusses the importance of emotional intelligence in both personal and societal contexts. He argues that individuals with higher emotional intelligence are more effective leaders and are happier overall. He also points out that human cognition is constantly evolving, but our brains have not yet evolved to keep pace.

00:20:00
In the video, Ryu Hassan explains that we now know what happiness is biologically, and that it can be found through cooperation. He goes on to say that if we want civilization, we have to accept that there are lazy elites, or those who are not emotionally intelligent. This is why social intelligence is so important.

00:25:00
The video discusses the possibility that technological advancements may lead to a decrease in the capacity for humans to collaborate effectively. The speaker points out that the first cognitive revolution--the development of language--has had a significant effect on the way in which humans interact with each other, and that the gap between those who are very knowledgeable and those who are not is widening. He argues that if we want to continue to be able to work together effectively, we must focus on fostering familiarity among ourselves.

00:30:00
In this video, Ryu Hassan explains how humans are comforted by the dichotomy between objective and subjective reality, and how this creates a gap between what is real and what is not. He goes on to say that this gap is important because it allows for productivity to increase because it allows for us to collaborate.

00:35:00
In this video, Ryu Hassan discusses the idea that the NKRI, or the Indonesian state, is not worth defending because it is a product of human competition and will eventually disappear. He argues that this human tendency to compete should be practiced, rather than discouraged, because it is what has allowed humans to develop and progress.

00:40:00
The main point of the video is that there are choices that we have to make in our lives, and the consequences of those choices are often severe. For example, in Japan it is not allowed to interfere with the spirituality of others, while in Finland it is important to be open and communicate with others. The video also discusses how technology has advanced so that we are now able to treat many different diseases and disorders using medicine that is purely based on technology.

00:45:00
This video discusses the possibility of transferring knowledge and experience from one person to another through the use of a chip called Neuralink. If this technology is developed and implemented, it could lead to a future in which people are able to replace or augment their own bodies with prosthetic devices.

00:50:00
The video discusses how evolutionist Ryu Hassan believes that humans are able to progress thanks to scientific discoveries and the evolution of technology. However, he also points out that there is a tendency for humans to become disorderly and that it is up to the individual to fight against this entropy.

00:55:00
The video discusses the possibility of humans eventually becoming able to transcend their biological limitations, thanks to advances in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. While some are worried about the implications this will have on humanity as a whole, others believe that it will lead to a more harmonious and inclusive world.

01:00:00
The video discusses the idea that, due to the increasing complexity of life, humans are increasingly at the mercy of entropy. It goes on to say that, as a result, it is not about giving up but about choosing between two possible outcomes: one in which we surrender and one in which we continue to fight against entropy.

01:05:00
Ryu Hassan discusses the idea that it is sometimes necessary to make sacrifices in order to achieve a greater good. He emphasizes the importance of perspective, noting that what seems like a small sacrifice from one person's perspective may have a larger impact on the collective. He also discusses the idea that happiness can be measured and that it is important to pursue happiness for the sake of the collective.

01:10:00
This video discusses how emotional intelligence is more important than rational intelligence when it comes to being wise, as it allows us to sacrifice for the greater good. It also discusses an example of this in Japan, where a punk-looking guy followed and helped Indonesians return lost money at a airport, without feeling harmed.

01:15:00
Ryu Hassan discusses how depression can be caused by various factors, including technology and social media, and how people can help those in need. He also touches on the WHO's 2020 focus on depression, and how people can help by not giving advice to those who are struggling with depression.

01:20:00
In the video, Dr. Ryu Hassan discusses how the over-reliance on social media content can have a negative effect on the mental health of people who are depressed. He also suggests that it is up to individuals to make the choice to be emotionally intelligent, and that in an era of abundance of information, it is important to have wisdom as well.

01:25:00
The video discusses the idea that being wise has come with moral standards, and discusses how to be wise according to Sam Harris's book, "The Moral Landscape."

01:30:00
This video discusses the possible implications of neuroscience on morality and politics. It argues that, because of the way our brains are designed, we will never be able to obey traffic signs or maintain climate balance without training. It suggests that there are ways to share perspectives on neuroscience that can help us to maintain balance in the world.

01:35:00
Ryu Hassan discusses the concept of entropy and how it applies to the natural world. He goes on to say that humans can help create order and prevent entropy from taking over, even if it means sacrificing our own abilities. He argues that this is our only hope for recovering from the destruction we've caused.

01:40:00
Doctor Ryu Hassan discusses the human brain's ability to calculate and respond to situations, noting that this is the only chance to address climate change. He goes on to say that humans don't have free will and that all actions are caused by chemical reactions and electrical impulses. However, by understanding these processes better, humans can become happier and live more comfortably.
