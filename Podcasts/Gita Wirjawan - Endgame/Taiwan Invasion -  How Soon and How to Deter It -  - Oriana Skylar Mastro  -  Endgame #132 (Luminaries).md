Oriana Skylar Mastro, a cybersecurity fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University and a Pentagon advisor on China, discusses the possibility of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, which she believes is more likely than not to occur in the next few years. She suggests that the US and its allies must take more significant steps to enhance deterrence such as recalibrating their posture, increasing defense spending, and investing in offensive military capabilities to prevent an invasion, however, warns that these measures may not be enough if they do not meet the necessary threshold. Mastro also discusses the importance of controlling the South China Sea and Southeast Asia's need to adapt to the changing international environment if they wish to continue their policy of not choosing sides. Finally, Mastro paints an optimistic picture of Asia's future where the US and China are better partners who compete from their strengths while benefiting everyone worldwide.
Oriana Skylar Mastro of Stanford University discusses the importance of having strong military capabilities to prevent conflict and deter potential aggressors. Through having the necessary power, countries can ensure potential invaders will reconsider taking military action.

Detail Summary:

In this section, Oriana Skylar Mastro discusses the United States' belief in protecting those who can't protect themselves and how inaction leads to bigger problems. She also talks about China's willingness to sacrifice for Taiwan and why the US should consider asymmetric arms talks with China that would involve trading in some of its nuclear capability for China to downgrade their conventional capability. Additionally, she shares her background, and the challenges of balancing her work as a courtesy assistant professor of political science with her role as a part-time military reservist.

In this section, Oriana Skylar Mastro discusses her evolution in understanding China and how she went from an initial state of naivety to being considered a China hawk due to the country’s conflicting interests with the United States and countries in Southeast Asia. Mastro argues that China built its power carefully in ways that would not spark strong responses, which has allowed it to increase its power and be considered an equal to the United States. She also talks about her book on wartime diplomacy, where she argues that leaders' fear of escalation keeps countries from talking about potential negotiations, which keeps wars from ending.

00:10:00
In this section, the speaker suggests that a country like the United States should have a blanket policy that from day 1 of any conflict, they are willing to talk. This policy would take away the information because switching from "no, I'm not" to "I am" wouldn't tell you anything, while that switch could tell you that someone wants to get out of the war. Another suggestion is, for not great powers fighting but smaller countries, to often have a mediator that has some influence in the conflict to offer positive incentives, so that countries can be persuaded to talk. Additionally, she discusses how China's leadership and decision-making processes have changed in recent years, making it difficult to predict how they will proceed with regards to Taiwan. She notes that, although democracies are better leaders, one of the main disadvantages is that it takes them a long time to deliberate, while authoritarians can make a quick decision on a dime, like Xi Jinping. However, she goes on to say that she doesn't see a lack of useful information in the Chinese system, and that Xi Jinping is quite involved in his military and the reform process.

In this section, Oriana Skylar Mastro discusses the possibility of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, which she believes is more likely than not to occur in the next few years. Mastro attributes this threat to Chinese President Xi Jinping's more centralized power structure, which has allowed for a stronger and more professional military, as well as his focus on modernizing the People’s Liberation Army for Taiwan missions over the past few decades. Mastro argues that in order to prevent an invasion, the US and its allies must take more significant steps to enhance deterrence, such as recalibrating their posture, increasing defense spending, and investing in offensive military capabilities. However, Mastro warns that these measures may not be enough to deter China if they do not meet the necessary threshold.

00:20:00
In this section of the video, Oriana Skylar Mastro discusses the need for countries to take significant deterrence measures to prevent a possible war over Taiwan. Mastro emphasizes the importance of reaching a minimal threshold to discourage Beijing from attacking Taiwan, and she cites Japan's reassurances to China as an example of strategic ambiguity. Mastro says it's crucial for countries to make significant changes before the war starts to deter it, and she also discusses South Korea's inflexibility and primary concern related to North Korea's attacks. When asked about the impact of the war in Ukraine on China's thinking, Mastro opines that it only confirms the Chinese view that command and control logistics are crucial in war fighting, and the Chinese Communist Party has been focused on sanction-proofing China.

00:25:00
In this section, Oriana Skylar Mastro explains China's political preparations for an invasion of Taiwan, which effectively reduce the likelihood of countries coming to Taiwan's support. For instance, strategic partnerships signed with the vast majority of U.S. allies have a clause that promises not to let Taiwan disrupt their relationship with China. This policy raises the question of why some countries would fight China if they believe Taiwan is already theirs. Mastro also emphasizes the importance of conventional conflict below the nuclear threshold, where she sees China's nuclear capabilities as not being enough to deter conflict with the US.

00:30:00
In this section, Oriana Skylar Mastro discusses the United States' investment in nuclear weapons and suggests that the US should invest more in conventional capabilities rather than tactical nuclear weapons. She presents a controversial recommendation that in exchange for China downgrading some of their conventional missile capabilities, the US could trade in some of their nuclear capabilities for arms control talks. Mastro also highlights the many ways that China could be deterred, including having Japan defend Taiwan, deploying more forces in the southwestern part of Japan, and having countries refuse to trade with China if they attack Taiwan. However, she notes that countries are not willing to impose these costs, making it difficult to deter China.

00:35:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the role of economic relationships as a deterrent in a potential Taiwan invasion by China. She states that while economic relationships can be powerful deterrents, she sees weaker wills on the economic side than the military side. The speaker suggests that more European NATO military involvement in Asia, not because they have any military role, but as a signal of their willingness to absorb costs that will tell Beijing that they would take economic steps if necessary, which could deter China from invading Taiwan. The speaker believes that the willingness to suffer economically for the sake of preventing war in Asia is necessary, and more needs to be done on all countries' parts to prevent the conflict. Finally, the speaker explains that there is no clear right or wrong in the Taiwan conflict, and it is complicated.

00:40:00
In this section, Oriana Skylar Mastro discusses the importance of the United States being a security partner to entities like Taiwan, Japan, and Australia in order to defend the U.S. homeland. She explains that while Taiwan is not seen as technologically symbolic to China, it is a security-based and emotional issue for China, as they believe the U.S. will continue to try to weaken them by playing the Taiwan card. Mastro also explains the situation in the South China Sea, stating that China can establish full control over the South China Sea short of a large-scale war, which would be worse for the region geopolitically than China physically controlling Taiwan.

00:45:00
In this section, Oriana Skylar Mastro, a cybersecurity fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University, discusses the importance of controlling the South China Sea, and how China wants control over it because they control the waterways, which control countries' destinations. She explains how certain countries have different levels of acceptance when it comes to how much a foreign entity can control their destiny, and that countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam would be impacted by any control China has over the sea. Mastro believes it's in the US interest to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific and that the US has a zero percent tolerance for foreign governments to determine their future. She notes that China's control over the South China Sea would make them the hegemon in Asia, and the US would have a difficult time supporting countries.

00:50:00
In this section, Oriana Skylar Mastro, a Pentagon advisor on China, discusses China's strategy in Southeast Asia and their desire for neutrality, which is often achieved by asking countries to do nothing. Mastro also notes that Southeast Asia is not acting in a coordinated fashion and needs to adapt as the international environment changes if they wish to continue their policy of not choosing sides. Furthermore, Mastro believes that Southeast Asia punches below their weight, despite a large population and economy, and need to adopt an entrepreneurial attitude to achieve the desired strategic end.

00:55:00
In this section of the video, Oriana Skylar Mastro discusses the challenges of creating a collective power capable of deterring a Taiwan invasion by China. She explains that unit cohesion and homogeneity play an essential role in creating military deterrence. However, she also highlights that China's obsession with homogeneity and its approach to promoting it may not be the preferred way to approach collective power. The U.S. is trying to empower southeast Asian countries to make sovereign decisions instead of controlling them, like China. Mastro paints an optimistic picture of Asia's future, where the U.S. and China are better partners who compete from their strengths while benefiting everyone worldwide.

01:00:00
In this section, Oriana Skylar Mastro of Stanford University emphasizes the importance of countries having strong military capabilities to prevent conflict and to deter potential aggressors from considering war as an option. By having the necessary military power in place, countries can ensure that a potential invader will think twice before attempting to take military action.
