In this section, professor Roland Horne talks about the "Trilemma" between energy, ecology, and economy. He believes that the force of people who want to increase their energy consumption to improve their lives will overpower the force of those who want to move away from fossil fuels. However, he thinks that the expected level of energy consumption will shrink as the population of the planet keeps increasing. He also shares his story of how he got into the field of energy science and engineering and how he ended up at Stanford University.

In this section, the speaker recounts how he landed a job at Stanford after a graduate degree in Auckland. He sent postcards with his address looking for a job after publishing a paper, and one of the requests came from Stanford. He joined as acting assistant professor in chemical engineering but taught a class in petroleum engineering's geothermal class section. He arrived during an exciting time between two energy shocks when the three geothermal industries began in California, the Philippines, and Indonesia. Later, he talks about how in New Zealand, where he received his degree, engineering focused on large construction projects for energy, including hydroelectric projects and geothermal, which was considered a cutting-edge technology.

00:10:00
In this section, Roland Horne discusses the development of the Wairakei Geothermal Power Station in New Zealand which was the second in the world and the first liquid-dominated system. The project was initiated and supported by the government as it was the only institution big enough to undertake such large projects. Unlike coal, oil, and gas, geothermal was a new technology and one that was significant in New Zealand's energy mix, which is now about 80% from renewables. Despite natural gas fields being discovered offshore the North Island, they are now reaching the end of their lives, which means natural gas will be a disappearing resource for the country, and geothermal energy is likely to become even more significant in the future.

00:15:00
In this section, the conversation shifted to the trilemma of balancing energy, ecology, and economy in the context of sustainability. While almost 80% of New Zealand's power comes from hydro with a little bit of wind and solar, geothermal energy has significantly grown and now comprises 20-23% of the total power. However, achieving sustainability in the energy sector is a complex issue, and even energy professionals do not have clear solutions to address the trilemma of sustainability, climate change, and energy and economic crises. Horne emphasized the need to replace fossil fuels with other renewables such as solar and geothermal energy, but it cannot be done overnight. Additionally, Horne discussed the common misconception when it comes to peak oil and the two peaks: a peak in discoveries and a peak in production.

00:20:00
In this section, Roland Horne discusses the sustainability of shale gas and shale oil production, which has doubled US oil and gas production. However, despite the ability to bring down production costs, the demand for oil and gas is likely to increase in the coming years with billions of people moving up the economic ladder and lacking affordable alternatives. While there are places with a high concentration of electric vehicles, many people do not have the choice to switch due to economic constraints or lack of alternatives. Therefore, Horne predicts that oil consumption will not decline and may even surpass 100 million barrels a day, even as electric vehicle costs come down.

00:25:00
In this section, the discussion focuses on the trilemma between energy, ecology, and economy. The conversation highlights the transition that the oil and gas industry is going through, changing its name to reflect the move towards energy transition research. While the shift towards renewables is happening, it is not happening as quickly as some would like. The demand for energy is growing, which dampens efforts to move away from fossil fuels. The conversation also discusses how developing economies may find it challenging to embrace the renewable movement because of structural and economic limitations. However, technological innovations are making renewable alternatives cheaper and more efficient.  Overall, the transition to renewables is happening, but it is a slow process.

00:30:00
In this section, Roland Horne discusses the classification of large hydroelectric projects as non-renewable and how this has affected their accessibility to tax rebates and feed-in tariffs. He then goes on to talk about the dynamics between different renewable resources, such as hydro, solar, wind, and geothermal. He explains that no single resource can satisfy the market by itself and that a combination of these renewables is necessary for the grid to work in terms of how they develop. He also discusses how solar has seen exponential growth due to becoming cheaper and cheaper, but it has now become somewhat saturated, and the technology required to make more solar is storage, currently based on batteries.

00:35:00
In this section, the discussion revolves around the concept of energy trading, where people can buy and sell electricity generated by sources like gas peaker plants, wind turbines, solar panels, and EVs. The integration of EVs with renewable energy sources like solar is also discussed, and how it can be efficient to charge EVs during the day when solar is at its peak. However, since it is more convenient for people to charge their EVs during peak hours where demand is high, the need for energy storage is emphasized. The discussion concludes with the need for a grid that can efficiently distribute electricity generated by renewable energy sources like rooftop solar panels, and provide backup for sources like gas peaker plants.

00:40:00
In this section, the video discusses the potential for solar panels and geothermal heat pumps to make people more independent in their energy consumption. However, storage technology is still necessary for times when there is not enough solar energy available. Geothermal energy is seen as a riskier investment than solar because of the geological uncertainty associated with it, which makes it difficult to predict how much energy it will generate and how long it will last. This makes it a better fit for oil and gas companies who understand the nature of resource uncertainty. Despite this, there is already substantial geothermal capacity installed around the world, with most of it being in the US, followed by Indonesia and the Philippines.

00:45:00
In this section of the video, the conversation revolves around what it would take for countries like Indonesia to jump on the bandwagon of geothermal energy. The speaker believes that the only thing holding Indonesia back from doing so is access to large amounts of capital, which it could get from outside concessionaires. Building tariffs and production tax credits are mechanisms used in many countries to develop geothermal, and while some international capital holders and technology holders decide not to stay in Indonesia, improving the countryâ€™s economics could make it more appealing. To become a modern nation and multiply its pre-existing power generation capabilities by five times, Indonesia needs a clean and scalable power source solution.

00:50:00
In this section, Roland Horne discusses the alternative energy sources available in Indonesia and how they can be used to increase the country's energy production. While geothermal energy is one of the steps that could be taken, it alone cannot increase Indonesia's national capacity by a factor of five. Horne suggests that hydro energy can be used, although the supply and demand are on opposite sides. He also mentions that nuclear energy could be a solution to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, but he acknowledges the social aspect and the rejection of sensible ideas for various reasons.

00:55:00
In this section, the conversation focuses on the history and future of nuclear energy. While nuclear power came back on the table in the 2000s and plans were being made to build new power plants in the US, the enthusiasm towards it quickly disappeared after the events of Fukushima in 2011. Despite the data suggesting that casualties from nuclear power in the last few decades would have been significantly less than those caused by air pollution, there is still strong resistance to nuclear power due to concerns about its safety. However, the guest argues that there may not be a practical solution for many developing countries without the inclusion of a nuclear narrative.

In this section, Roland Horne discusses his experience teaching in a nightclub in Jakarta and shares his thoughts on the world's path towards carbon neutrality by 2050. While he is optimistic about the progress being made in moving towards carbon neutrality, he believes that achieving it by 2050 is unlikely due to the difficulty in changing human behavior. He believes that a combination of technology, policy, and human behavior is necessary and that storage will be critical in enabling the use of various renewable sources such as solar, geothermal, and hydropower. Finally, he believes that while electric transportation is feasible for ships and boats, planes will take longer to become electric.

01:05:00
In this section, Professor Roland Horne from Stanford University discusses the future of transportation and how telecommuting and telecommunication will substitute a lot for transportation, cutting down on moving people and large objects from place to place. He mentions that structural changes in the way people work have occurred due to the pandemic, and he believes that we can take advantage of that by focusing on doing what we need to do wherever we are, instead of traveling to different locations. While the storage and competition of data will require energy, it will be much less than moving people and objects across the planet.
