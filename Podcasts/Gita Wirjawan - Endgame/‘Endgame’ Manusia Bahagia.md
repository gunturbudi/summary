In this section, the video discusses the topic of happiness, stating that happiness is a skill and a state of mind that is not something you achieve or possess. The speakers ask philosophical questions about what makes people happy and share their own experiences of feeling happy, but also acknowledge that happiness can be elusive or temporary. Overall, the video suggests that happiness is important in life and that people should aim to cultivate it as a skill.

In this section, the speaker discusses the true source of happiness, which is not control over the world, but rather knowing the truth about yourself and your feelings. The mechanism at work in the body is quite simple: there are only two types of sensations, pleasant and unpleasant, and the mind reacts in one of two ways, wanting more or wanting less of the sensation. This mechanism has been the underlying cause throughout human history and despite achieving enormous power over thousands of years, people are not significantly happier than they were in the Stone Age since the reaction of wanting more is endless. The most basic mechanism that underpins the mind is the simple law of effect, where anything that causes pleasure is desired more, and anything that causes displeasure is avoided. However, pleasure is not an end in itself as moving towards viable bounds is where good feelings lie, and once you are within those bounds, you no longer feel pleasure, but rather satiation.

In this section of the video titled "‘Endgame’ Manusia Bahagia", the speaker discusses the concept of Nirvana being a state of no protein activation, no demand for work, and no distressing feelings. He believes that recognizing the viable range of sustenance for humans is enough and that there is no need to go beyond that. The speaker also talks about what makes him happy, which includes having a connection with his culture and spending time with family and friends. The topic of happiness is further explored, and the speaker suggests that instead of seeking a definition of happiness, it's better to focus on the question of whether we want our experience of life to be pleasant or unpleasant.

In this section, Sadhguru encourages people to set their happiest moment as the baseline for their lives. He believes that many people have settled for less than happiness and have given up on ecstasy, peace, or even being trouble-free. Instead, he urges people to focus on what they can do and what brings them joy, rather than trying to attain a certain percentage of pleasantness. Sadhguru sees this as a unique human problem, where people try to fill the void of their ignorance with beliefs to feel more confident in living. He urges people to use their intelligence to understand the nature and source of creation, rather than blindly following someone else's conclusion.

In this section, the speaker emphasizes that seeking the truth is more important than relying on an authority figure, whether it be a religious text, preacher, or guru. The only authority should be the truth itself, and seeking should be done with an open mind and without conclusions. The speaker also notes the power of social media to spread spiritual teachings and reach children who are seeking on their own. Confusion is praised over foolish conclusions because confusion brings humility and a greater desire to seek the truth.
