In this video, political scientist John Mearsheimer discusses various topics, including the ongoing war in Ukraine, the foreign policy of the US during the unipolar moment, the evolution of multilateral institutions and global order, and the consequences of NATO expansion. He argues that states are primarily concerned about the balance of power, and during the unipolar moment, the US pursued a foreign policy that was not realist, instead of liberal hegemony. Mearsheimer points out that the American policy towards China and Russia has led these two countries to form a closer relationship. The war in Ukraine will likely continue for a very long time, and the US may pressure Ukraine into launching a major offensive this spring, which Mearsheimer believes is a mistake. Additionally, he discusses the potentially dangerous situation of China militarizing islands in the South China Sea, viewing it as their own body of water.
John Mearsheimer discusses the potential consequences of a spring offensive by Ukraine against Russia and explains why he is popular in China. He also discusses the rationality of China's desire to become a regional hegemon in Asia, which involves pushing the Americans out of the region and establishing dominance. Mearsheimer warns that the intense security competition that results from this desire may lead to war, thus illustrating the tragedy of great power politics. He emphasizes the need for the US to be extremely careful not to force China to attack Taiwan or the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, as the Chinese may have no choice but to attack, despite suffering from the military balance. Mearsheimer predicts that American politics will not change anything with regards to Ukraine and Taiwan, and that domestic unrest may be more likely in Europe than in the United States.

Detail Summary:

In this section, Professor John Mearsheimer discusses the ongoing war in Ukraine and predicts that it is likely to continue for a long time. The best outcome that can be hoped for is a cold peace between Ukraine and Russia. The winners in the war are the Chinese, as the situation resembles a new cold war where there is a global Chinese-led order and an American-led order, just like during the Soviet-led order from the cold war. Later, Gita Wirjawan, the host, asks Mearsheimer about his journey into political science and his theory of realism, which explains that states pursue their self-interests regardless of moral considerations.

00:05:00
In this section, political scientist John Mearsheimer explains that states are primarily concerned about the balance of power, especially great powers because they worry about their survival. If a state is weak, other great powers or powers in general will take advantage of them. Realism does not differentiate between democracies and non-democracies; it treats all states as black boxes that want to maximize their relative power regardless of the political order at home. Mearsheimer argues that during the unipolar moment, from 1990 to 2017, the US pursued a foreign policy that was not realist; instead, it was liberal hegemony. The US pushed for democracy in some situations and disguised its realist behaviors with liberal rhetoric in others.

00:10:00
In this section of the video, political scientist John Mearsheimer discusses the foreign policy of the United States during the unipolar moment and its shift towards realpolitik behavior towards China. During the unipolar moment, the US pursued a liberal policy due to the absence of any other great powers in the system, allowing it to engage with China and help it become a responsible stakeholder. However, as China began to grow more powerful, the US adopted a containment policy against it, becoming more aggressive and causing China to respond in kind. Mearsheimer attributes this shift in posture to China's impressive economic growth, leading the US to view China as a real threat that needed to be contained.

00:15:00
In this section, political scientist John Mearsheimer speaks about the evolution of multilateral institutions and global order. During the unipolar moment, the United States was in charge of the liberal international order, which it created from the Western order after winning the Cold War. However, in a multi-polar world with China and Russia as other great powers, the Chinese are going to want to write their own rules for that order, or they're going to want to change the rules in a way that's more favorable to them. The Chinese and the Americans are now creating their own orders, and what we have is two emerging regional orders with an increasingly thin international order. The Western Hemisphere is the most important region to the United States, but East Asia and Europe will remain key regions for the foreseeable future.

00:20:00
In this section, John Mearsheimer explains that the Persian Gulf is crucial to the United States not because of the presence of great powers, but due to the region's oil supply. He states that East Asia, including Southeast Asia, now holds more strategic importance than Europe, and the US government will focus more on Southeast Asia as China becomes more of a threat. He also discusses his prescient views on Ukraine and the failure of Washington to act on his warnings.

00:25:00
In this section, political scientist John Mearsheimer discusses the reasons why American policymakers did not listen to warnings about the potential consequences of incorporating Ukraine into NATO. Mearsheimer argues that the Russians, who adhere to realist logic, view the expansion of NATO as a direct threat to their security and vital interests. He believes that the United States should have backed off and avoided pushing Ukraine toward NATO membership, as the Russians made it clear that they would wreck Ukraine if the United States persisted. Despite warnings from many officials, including Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy, American policymakers doubled down on their policy, ultimately leading to the current conflict in Ukraine. Mearsheimer attributes this failure to two reasons, the first being that American policymakers, including Joe Biden, were especially hawkish on Ukraine, and the second being a belief in American exceptionalism and a lack of understanding of realist international relations theory.

00:30:00
In this section, John Mearsheimer discusses the reasons behind NATO's expansion eastward and the consequences of such actions. He believes that American policymakers believed NATO expansion was part of a benign strategy, even though the Russians repeatedly expressed concern. Mearsheimer thinks that any country in Eastern Europe wants to be in NATO to be under the American security umbrella, but joining may provoke the Russians and lead to its destruction. Additionally, he believes that Sweden and Finland joining NATO is foolish and will make the Russians feel more insecure.

00:35:00
In this section, political scientist John Mearsheimer points out how the American policy towards China and Russia has led these two countries to form a closer relationship. He explains that China has a deep interest in Russia not losing in Ukraine and that they would do everything to prevent that from happening. Mearsheimer also highlights how Sweden and Finland are no longer neutral key players in the Arctic, which creates an unbalanced situation in the region. Consequently, Russian conventional forces are weakened and would have to rely more on nuclear weapons, making the world more dangerous than it was during the Cold War.

00:40:00
In this section, John Mearsheimer discusses the interdependence between China and Russia, with the former being more dependent on the latter but insisting that "asymmetric dependence" is a better way of putting it rather than subordination. The war in Ukraine, according to Mearsheimer, will go on for a very long time as long as the Russians and Ukrainians do not agree on how to divide Ukraine and if Ukraine becomes a member of the West or remains a neutral state. Meanwhile, the United States should pivot to East Asia and form good relations with Russia, as China is its pure competitor. The countries in East Asia should be worried about what the US is doing since the cost of financing would have a severe impact on their economy.

00:45:00
In this section, political scientist John Mearsheimer discusses the ongoing war in Ukraine and its potential outcome. While the description of the situation is accurate, Mearsheimer notes that there is a disconnect between the elites and public opinion in the West, and that the US may pressure Ukraine into launching a major offensive this spring, which he believes is a mistake. Even if Ukraine gains substantial territory, the Russians will not give up without a fight, as this war is a matter of life and death for them. Mearsheimer argues that the US has gotten itself into a heap of trouble by starting this war and doubling down on its actions, and there is no way out. Finally, he notes that the only way nuclear weapons may be used in this conflict is if the Russians are losing badly and feel compelled to use them to rescue the situation.

00:50:00
In this section, John Mearsheimer discusses the paradoxical nature of America's policy towards Ukraine, which aims to defeat the Russian army inside Ukraine, cripple its economy, and put Putin on trial, ultimately knocking Russia out of the ranks of great powers. However, the more successful the West is in accomplishing these goals, the more likely it is that Russia may turn to nuclear weapons. In terms of Asia, Mearsheimer discusses the tensions surrounding Taiwan and its significance to China as sacred territory, making it an important flashpoint. While he doesn't see war breaking out over Taiwan as imminent, as China's economic and military capabilities grow, so too will their ability to conquer Taiwan.

00:55:00
In this section, political scientist John Mearsheimer discusses the potentially dangerous situation of China militarizing islands in the South China Sea, viewing it as their own body of water. The United States and their allies may draw a line in the water to protect the Philippines and their credibility. Mearsheimer also discusses the difficulty of an amphibious assault on Taiwan and how both China and the US and its allies will go to great lengths to build up their capabilities. He cautions that sometimes there are situations where states have a political incentive to go to war that is so powerful that they will pursue a military strategy that has little chance of working because the politics of the situation dictate pursuing a remarkably risky strategy. The canonical example of this is the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, where their strategists understood that they had only a sliver of a chance to win but attacked due to politics.

01:00:00
In this section, John Mearsheimer explains how Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and the current situation involving Taiwan are examples of the political calculations that matter in a deterrent situation. He adds that the US must be extremely careful not to force China to attack Taiwan or the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, as even though the Chinese could suffer from the military balance, they may have no choice but to attack. Mearsheimer also believes that American politics will not change anything with regards to Ukraine and Taiwan, as American foreign policy is set in stone, and both parties think about foreign policy in similar ways. Moreover, Mearsheimer predicts that domestic unrest may be more likely in Europe than in the United States.

01:05:00
In this section, international relations expert John Mearsheimer discusses the potential consequences of a spring offensive by Ukraine against Russia, arguing that it could lead to a crisis for Ukraine and undermine support in the West. He also explains why he is popular in China, attributing it to the Chinese interest in IR theory, their desire to hear that China will become a great power competitor, and his willingness to take China seriously. Mearsheimer also notes that China is interested in his theory so they can figure out how to show that China can rise peacefully, despite his argument that an intense security competition is inevitable if China continues to rise peacefully.

01:10:00
In this section, John Mearsheimer discusses the rationality of China's desire to become a regional hegemon in Asia, which involves pushing the Americans out of the region and establishing dominance. From the perspective of Chinese leaders, this makes strategic sense for their survival. However, this is not viewed as a desirable outcome by the Americans or China's neighbors who are likely to push back and try to contain China. This results in an intense security competition that may lead to war, thus illustrating the tragedy of great power politics.
