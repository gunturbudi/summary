In this section, Gibran Huzaifah shares his experience of moving to a new area and having to attend a less-than-desirable high school due to not passing his Ujian Nasional exam. He wanted to attend the prestigious SMA 8, but ended up having to attend a small, unknown private school near his home. Despite the school's shortcomings, Gibran remained focused on his academic goals and eventually set his sights on attending ITB, Indonesia's best university. Despite the lack of academic rigor at his high school, Gibran's determination ultimately led him to achieve his dreams.

In this section, Gibran Huzaifah shares his high school experiences, particularly about his friend who believed that they were "big actors in civilization" and only starred in big movies, not soap operas like Ganteng-Ganteng Serigala. This optimism gave Gibran hope that he could achieve something big in life. Despite his high school being chaotic, with students doing all kinds of activities, including shooting pellet guns, skateboarding, and filming, he still managed to keep a positive outlook on his future. This helped him navigate his way to his dream university, the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB), to study biology. Despite facing economic difficulties due to his father's retrenchment, he managed to continue his studies and become the first and only alumnus of his high school to attend ITB.

In this section, Gibran Huzaifah, entrepreneur and politician, tells the story of his first month in college where he had to live alone with only Rp 9,000 ($0.62) daily to feed himself. He recounts the struggles he faced during Ramadan when he couldn't afford to buy enough food to break his fast every day, and was left with only Rp 500 ($0.03) which he used to go to college. Gibran also had no one to turn to for help and ended up sleeping in a mosque for three days without food. He was eventually rescued by his mother, who sent him money at midnight. This experience inspired Gibran to help eradicate hunger in Indonesia through his role in politics and entrepreneurship.

In this section, Gibran Huzaifah shares his experience of struggling to survive while pursuing his education at ITB. Despite having to juggle between part-time jobs and studying, Gibran became ambitious about joining various student organizations and was even elected as the head of the student council. However, his academic performance took a hit due to a lack of motivation to stay in college and his main goal became to survive. It was only when he received a project to work on a tutorial platform that he accidentally ventured into entrepreneurship. He was introduced to an alumni who gave him a project to solve 16 questions and each question was paid at an hourly rate of IDR 150,000 regardless of how long he took to solve it.

In this section, Gibran Huzaifah, the founder of eFishery, shares his experience in starting a fish farming business while studying in Bandung. He rented a large pond and started with local fish species, and after selling to different markets, he realized the challenges of the industry, such as selling the fish live and being controlled by a small group of middlemen. To overcome this, he started filleting and making nuggets out of the fish, which he then sold to students in a canteen at ITB. This proved successful, leading him to expand the business into 7 branches, and he eventually had 76 ponds that generated an income of 25-30 million IDR per cycle, or up to 3 billion IDR per pond. The challenges he faced led to the creation of eFishery, a smart fish feeder system that increases efficiency and can be controlled via a smartphone, and is currently used in thousands of fishponds throughout Indonesia, providing a solution to the problems in the industry.

00:35:00
In this section, Gibran Huzaifah talks about his journey to becoming a leading fish farmer in Indonesia. He learned from experienced fish farmers and discovered that feeding the fish is the most challenging and costly aspect of fish farming. This inspired him to create a system that would allow farmers to feed fish using their mobile phones. He created a prototype using simple materials such as a can and a DVD-ROM, and presented it to a well-established fish farmer who was amazed by the technology. With this system, farmers could save up a lot of money on labor costs and feed their fish more efficiently. Gibran's goal was to help small fish farmers boost their income and improve their livelihoods.

00:40:00
In this section, Gibran Huzaifah discusses the founding of eFishery with a starting investment of only Rp 60,000 ($4.50). Upon realizing the potential for the device, he sought advice from colleagues including the founders of Bukalapak, who encouraged him to focus on IoT, explaining that the internet "would be the next big thing." He then began exploring the possibilities of building an internet business for eFishery, starting by convincing farmers to use the device who were initially skeptical about the device. Gibran and his team overcame this through phase-by-phase initial adoption, ultimately resulting in the development of their own marketplace platform.

00:45:00
In this section, Gibran Huzaifah discusses how they utilized data to address the biggest cost for farmers, which is the cost of animal feed. They used the data to aggregate the purchase of livestock feed from manufacturers and sell it directly to farmers at a lower cost. To tackle the problem of farmers being unable to pay upfront for purchases, they partnered with fintech and later with banks to provide credit scoring for farmers. They also used data to predict crop output, allowing them to contract for purchases one month before harvest and find buyers for the crops. They built an end-to-end digital ecosystem similar to a cooperative to provide farmers with access to financing, input, and markets, resulting in significant revenue growth and a large customer base.

In this section, Gibran Huzaifah, CEO of eFishery, talks about the company's impact on Indonesian fish farmers. eFishery has helped farmers by providing access to technology, increasing funding, building infrastructure, and improving breeding methods. As a result, farmers have been able to expand and significantly increase their income in just a matter of months. Communities have also benefited, with formerly unemployed people now becoming successful fish entrepreneurs. The company has empowered around 85,000 farmers across Indonesia, and their goal is to reduce the technological gap and inequality in the Indonesian economy while increasing prosperity for everyone.

00:55:00
In this section, Gibran Huzaifah discusses the resistance to disruption from established paradigms among large-scale farmers when introducing new technologies in the pet fisheries industry. This is because their main source of income is affected. As the team progresses into midstream and downstream, more resistance is seen from other players such as middlemen and feed agents who charge high finance costs for the farmer. To combat this, the team had to work with the middlemen to strike a balance and ensure minimum social risk while still disrupting the industry. Eventually, they had to convince the middlemen to partner with them and integrate their businesses. This was made possible by showing how it would benefit both parties involved.

In this section, Gibran Huzaifah discusses Indonesia's potential to become the number one global player in the aquaculture industry. With its long coastline and underutilization of its potential, Indonesia could focus on cultivating fish and shrimp to become a leader in the food industry. Furthermore, fish and shrimp require less feed and land than other animals, making them a more sustainable source of protein. As Indonesia currently lacks any top global seafood companies, eFishery aims to pave the way for Indonesia to become a leader in aquaculture technology.

01:05:00
In this section, Gibran Huzaifah discusses the potential of the fish farming industry in Indonesia and how it could contribute to the country's food security. The goal is to have one million fish farmers by 2025, which could potentially yield an estimated $3 billion in revenue. While it may be difficult to measure the contribution of eFishery to the overall increase in protein consumption from fish, Gibran notes that the consumption of fish as a protein source is already rising in Indonesia, particularly in areas where people have lower incomes and often rely on fish as a primary source of nutrition. Despite the potential, Gibran acknowledges that it may be challenging to convince Indonesians to adopt a fully vegan diet, making the fish farming industry a critical player in the nation's food security in the foreseeable future.

01:10:00
In this section, Gibran Huzaifah and his guest discuss the differences in profit margins between farming shrimp and fish. They note that shrimp farming has a much higher profit margin, making up 18% of their business compared to fish farming's 1%. However, they acknowledge that shrimp farming is more susceptible to disease, and they are working on developing a system to prevent and detect diseases early. They also discuss the need for financing for fish farmers, as local financiers are unsupportive due to the high risk and uncertainty involved.

01:15:00
In this section, Gibran Huzaifah, the CEO and co-founder of eFishery, shared his experiences about the challenges he faced during his journey towards building his aquaculture technology company. Huzaifah explained how in the early days he faced numerous financial losses, for example, one project loss was due to the production manager's escape with waste, which left the bin storage abandoned and smelling horrible, leading authorities to believe it was a site for storing dead bodies. However, his biggest challenge was probably raising funds for the company, initially, it appeared to be very unattractive to investors, and for nine months they struggled to keep their employees paid on time. He also talked about how his team survived on credit cards after being unable to pay salaries and how he had to live in the same house that his company rented as an office with his pregnant wife. Nonetheless, after several difficulties, eFishery successfully obtained new funding that helped turn the tide for the company.

01:20:00
In this section, Gibran Huzaifah, the founder of eFishery, shares the struggles he and his team faced in the early days of the company, including the pressure of potential failure and losing employees who believed in the mission. Despite their challenges, the team's dedication to the company's mission helped them overcome difficulties and scale the business. However, Huzaifah recognizes that as the company grows, there will be new challenges, and he must continue investing in his own development as a founder to avoid losing sight of the company's mission. He emphasizes the importance of staying true to the mission and not getting distracted by external pressures.

01:25:00
In this section, Gibran Huzaifah discusses the challenges of building a company with a mission to help farmers while still being financially successful. He emphasizes the importance of not losing sight of the mission and continuously innovating to better serve farmers. The risk of external factors, such as climate change, is also a significant concern for the production of food, which requires thoughtful consideration for the long-term. When discussing hiring, Huzaifah looks for individuals who are deeply driven by the mission and able to overcome challenges creatively. Lastly, Huzaifah wants to contribute to eradicating hunger and feels that his company has already made significant contributions, but is still striving for more.

In this section, Gibran Huzaifah, the CEO of eFishery, discusses his motivation to build something new and better than the traditional ways of wealth creation such as politics, inheritance, and philanthropy. He expresses his frustration with the lifestyle of the wealthy and the vast and increasing wealth gap in society. Gibran Huzaifah's idea is to create a corporation based on a digital cooperative model that would enable true wealth creation to be directly distributed among the farmers instead of the wealthy few. The corporation, eFishery, values at $1 billion, and Gibran Huzaifah lays out his vision to transform it into a $30 billion or $60 billion company, where the wealth created is distributed directly to the farmers who are working under the umbrella of a cooperative model.

01:35:00
In this section of the video, Gibran Huzaifah discusses his goal to use technology to create wealth and distribute it in an inclusive and cooperative manner. He emphasizes the importance of tackling issues such as protein deficiency and economic inequality by empowering small-scale fishermen and farmers. However, he notes that the current global economic system, which favors countries that can print money over those that cannot, leads to a growing gap between the haves and the have-nots. Gibran believes that bridging this gap will require better education and literacy, as well as redistributing wealth through cooperatives or corporate ownership. While he acknowledges that there is no clear solution to this problem, he sees education as one of the most important tools for reducing inequality and creating new opportunities for people from all backgrounds.

01:40:00
In this section, Gibran Huzaifah talks about his passion for aquaculture and helping farmers achieve better livelihoods. He believes that reducing the wealth gap is difficult as money supply grows exponentially, leading to a structural imbalance in various countries. However, he aims to contribute towards reducing hunger and economic inequality by scaling up his work and learning from mentors such as Pak Gita. Through inspiration and dedication, Gibran hopes to make a positive impact in the world.
