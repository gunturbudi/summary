In this section, the speaker discusses the changes he has experienced since his last interview in September 2019, now that he is the Minister of Education. He shares that his movements and decision-making abilities are much more restricted in his current role, which has been a big adjustment for him. Additionally, he talks about how the culture of openness was not initially present when he first entered office, but over time, he has worked towards creating a culture where constructive debates are welcomed. The biggest change for him, however, has been the high profile nature of his role and the constant attention he receives, which has been difficult for him to adapt to mentally. Despite this, the speaker is motivated by the impact he can make in the education sector and feels that any pain he experiences is justified knowing that his decisions will positively impact future generations.

In this section, Nadiem Makarim discusses the challenges faced by the Ministry of Education and Culture in ensuring quality education for children. While the Ministry can only exercise limited control over schools, it has established centers such as the Center for Character Education to promote values and address various social issues relevant to the young generation. As for parents, Nadiem stresses that spending time with children is crucial and that simple tools such as books and discussions can significantly improve their literacy and critical thinking skills. He urges parents to engage in two-way conversations with their children and encourages them to ask questions, as every question is an opportunity for the child to learn and grow.

00:10:00
In this section, Nadiem Makarim discusses tools that parents can use to help develop critical thinking in their children. He emphasizes the importance of answering childrenâ€™s questions and encouraging discussion, as well as instilling confidence in their abilities. Makarim also discusses the need for increased attention and resources for early childhood education, stating that establishing PAUD as part of obligatory education and formalizing the role of PAUD teachers would be a necessary step forward. He expresses regret that the RUU Sisdiknas, which would have made these changes, was rejected in the past, possibly due to political considerations.

00:15:00
In this section, Nadiem Makarim emphasizes the importance of teachers for Pre-School Education (PAUD) and explains that even if the facility and education tools in a school are excellent, it will not work as intended if they have weak teachers. The crucial factor about teachers is their selection process, which aims to find teachers with growth mindsets that believe they can continuously improve and provide equal opportunities to each child. Additionally, he states that the philosophy of PAUD's learning process should apply in higher educational levels since schools must be enjoyable to create a long-term impact on students.

00:20:00
In this section, Nadiem Makarim, founder of Gojek and former Minister of Education and Culture in Indonesia, discusses the importance of schools being fun and engaging in creating lifelong learners. He emphasizes the need for adequate learning tools, especially for early childhood education, and highlights the importance of promoting literacy through books that children actually want to read. Makarim also addresses the issue of children and gadget addiction, suggesting that rather than trying to compete with technology, it's important to eliminate it from certain aspects of life, such as meal times and family bonding moments, and create alternative sources of entertainment and education that remain engaging and enjoyable for users.

00:25:00
In this section, Nadiem Makarim, the Minister of Education and Culture of Indonesia, talks about the negative effects of gadgets on children and the importance of the country's education system in comparison to other countries. He emphasizes that parents should not allow their children to develop an addiction to gadgets, and that the issue should be addressed by the whole family, policymakers, and society as a whole. He also points out that Indonesia needs to focus on improving its economy, as the level of education is linked with the GDP per capita, and the country needs to compete with other countries in that category. Additionally, he mentions that the country's educational assessment system needs to be reformed to help improve the education level of Indonesian students.

00:30:00
In this section, Nadiem Makarim discusses how Indonesia has become one of the first countries to align with international standards by implementing a national assessment that includes character surveys on intolerance, sexual harassment, and bullying. The ultimate goal of all their programs is to increase their education statistics, but it remains unclear when the numbers will improve. Nadiem stresses the importance of focusing on measuring numeracy and literacy rather than cramming students with information that has no impact on their educational performance. He also talks about the Kurikulum Merdeka, which focuses on three significant changes, such as content reduction, granting teachers the autonomy to move ahead or fall back based on students' competence, and taking 20% of school time to learn through project-based activities.

00:35:00
In this section, Nadiem Makarim talks about the three-pronged strategy to improve the literacy and numeracy rates in Indonesia's education system. First, it's the implementation of the Kurikulum Merdeka that focuses on tackling climate change and community engagement. Then, there's the Merdeka Mengajar platform, an online campus for teachers that allows them to share and learn from their peers. Finally, there's the Program PPG to improve teacher training, which includes creating a proper mindset, tightening the test standards, and delivering the relevant capabilities to address issues such as disabilities. Makarim believes in the potential for Indonesia to send more students abroad to study, and with LPDP, which has a 7 million dollar budget for education, he believes it's realistic to achieve the goal of having 150,000 Indonesian students learning abroad.

00:40:00
In this section, Nadiem Makarim shared about the Merdeka Belajar program and how it can provide opportunities for Indonesian students to gain international education experience. Although full-degree programs in top universities abroad can be expensive and challenging to obtain, Makarim stated that the program aims to provide opportunities for Indonesian students to gain international learning experiences in smaller segments, such as a semester. He explained that by giving high-quality educational resources and counseling, even students from remote areas can have access to these opportunities. With adequate budget allocation, the program could potentially benefit millions of Indonesian students.

00:45:00
In this section, Nadiem Makarim discusses the value of experiences gained through initiatives such as Kampus Merdeka, which allow Indonesian students to pursue activities outside of traditional university coursework. He challenges the idea that attending prestigious foreign universities is necessarily more valuable than gaining real-world experience, such as working at a multinational biotech company or learning data science through a program like Google Bangkit. Makarim emphasizes the need to scale up initiatives like Kampus Merdeka to provide students with a wide range of multi-sector experiences before graduation. He also advocates for more Indonesians to learn international languages like English and Mandarin to stay competitive in the global job market.

00:50:00
In this section, Nadiem Makarim discusses the importance of English education in Indonesia and the challenges of implementing it on a large scale. He believes that making English the lowest common denominator would have the greatest impact, but acknowledges that there is a limited pool of qualified teachers. Thus, he suggests investing in teacher training instead of forcing all students to attend expensive language courses. He also notes that private schools are not necessarily better than public schools and that the elimination of the UN (National Exam) in Indonesia was a mistake that allowed discrimination against low-income students. Lastly, he believes that prioritizing results and being willing to pay for expert teachers are necessary for developing expertise in fields like biology in Indonesia.

00:55:00
In this section, Nadiem Makarim discusses the development of structures and incentives in Indonesia for research, including collaborations with top research institutions from around the world. He believes that Indonesia is a great place for research due to the diversity of issues it faces, including climate change, maritime issues, and demographic challenges. However, he notes that Indonesia has lagged behind in economic growth compared to China, partly due to a lack of infrastructure investment, education, and competition. He sees an opportunity for Indonesia to grow in the future, especially in the development of marketplaces that increase productivity and tie into education.

01:00:00
In this section, Nadiem Makarim emphasizes the importance of education in Indonesia's future development, but acknowledges that there are other co-dependencies that should be considered as well, such as economic and industrial policies. Makarim argues that, while a strong education system is crucial, it cannot guarantee economic growth if other factors are not in place. He sees the low baseline of Indonesia's education system as an opportunity for innovation and reimagining schools and universities as innovative institutions. Additionally, Makarim reflects on the pressure of being held responsible for all of Indonesia's problems, but sees it as a motivator for meaningful change.

01:05:00
In this section of the video, Nadiem Makarim, the former Minister of Education and Culture of Indonesia, emphasizes the importance of innovation and experimentation in the education system. He argues that without giving schools and universities the freedom to experiment and fail, students will not be able to become creative and innovative. Makarim believes that the heads of schools and universities need to take the initiative in making changes and improving education. He acknowledges the challenges and resistance that come with change, but prioritizes the needs of the next generation of students. Makarim also discusses his approach to making change during his time as Minister, highlighting the importance of achieving a minimum scale for programs to ensure they cannot be easily reversed.

01:10:00
In this section, Nadiem Makarim stated his determination to fight for the education of the next generation, even if that means facing backlash or opposition. He believes that various programs, such as having at least 20% of schools led by influential teachers, can lead to automatic change. Makarim acknowledged that his goals may make him enemies or face misunderstandings, but he remains committed to transforming policies into a movement that no one can stop.
