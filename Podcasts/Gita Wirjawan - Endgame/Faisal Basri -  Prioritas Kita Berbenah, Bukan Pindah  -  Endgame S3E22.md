In this video, Faisal Basri discusses the importance of having priorities in life and not just changing governments every time there is a change in leadership. He argues that Indonesia needs to strengthen its political and economic institutions in order to move away from "value extraction" with muscle and sweat capital to "value creation" with brains. Basri also connects this idea to Indonesia's history of trying different ideologies in order to find something that works, but never defining themselves.

00:50:00
Basri discusses the good and bad aspects of the Indonesian economy, noting that low inflation is not an achievement, but reflects the people's low purchasing power. He also notes that investment is low and that the government has allowed banks to take funds from the public without disbursing them in the form of credit, due to an interest the state owes them.

00:55:00

01:25:00
The speaker talks about how regional autonomy and a focus on sea transportation are important for Indonesia's future prosperity. He argues that, under current conditions, Indonesia is not advancing as rapidly as it should be because of the country's prioritization of land transportation.

In 2045, Faisal Basri predicts that democracy in Indonesia will be more substantial, with the middle class playing a leading role in maintaining it.

01:45:00
In this video, Faisal Basri discusses the potential for a middle-income trap, which is a situation where a country falls into a cycle of low economic growth and high levels of inequality. He predicts that this trap will likely occur in countries where the three indicators of a poor economy are education, technology content in exports, and inequality. He encourages the audience to think about ways to promote industrialization in the old ways, but warns that this will be more difficult now that UKM (university-level graduates from abroad) are no longer being sent to developing countries.
