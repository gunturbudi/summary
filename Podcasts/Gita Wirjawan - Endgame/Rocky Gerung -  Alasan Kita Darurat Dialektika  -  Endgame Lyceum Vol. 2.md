Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
In this section, Rocky Gerung talks about the importance of critical thinking and democracy in today's society. He believes that the pillars of democracy stem from our ability to think as individuals, and that surplus information often results in ideas becoming stagnant, rather than allowing for productive discourse. Rocky highlights that by withholding the truth, our democratic society is at risk of falling under the control of fear, which is perpetuated by the idea that big brother is always watching us. He suggests that the only way to combat this is through conversation and the exchange of ideas, facilitated by the use of big data and artificial intelligence. However, he warns that we must not become too reliant on these technologies, in order to preserve our sense of self.

00:05:00
In this section, Rocky Gerung discusses the loss of our humanity and the prevalence of big data. He mentions that conversations often revolve around exchanging data rather than ideas and that this is due to the influence of big data and surveyors. Gerung suggests that the stoppage of ideas and the rise of robots and Bionics may be a preparation for the end of human history, which is causing our restlessness. He also comments on the relationship between humans and technology, stating that we have been trained to accept habitual behaviors from our devices. Gerung raises the question of whether the era of humans is coming to an end and if the new ontological relationship between humans and technology is the evolution of civilization into a new phase.

00:10:00
In this section, Rocky Gerung discusses the importance of language and culture in shaping our identities and behaviors. He explains that just as we have become increasingly specific in identifying the origins of our coffee, we should also strive to understand the origins of our behavior and identity. While digital algorithms may be the same for everyone, the ability to evaluate and react to it varies from person to person. Gerung argues that beyond the digital realm, humans are driven by a desire for something final and authentic, beyond the confines of language and digital grammar. He believes that in order to find a new kind of social harmony, we need to embrace authentic arguments and debates, rather than resorting to violence and other less productive means of communication in social and political discourse.

00:15:00
In this section, Rocky Gerung emphasizes the importance of dialectics in nurturing critical thinking in individuals. He argues that people should not be disturbed when they are thinking, but rather encouraged during conversations to prompt the bridging of different perspectives. Gerung urges that the country needs to be raised by dialectics and discourses. He illustrates how societal conditions have bred suspicion and mistrust between people, which hinders the generation of new ideas. Gerung urges individuals to reflect on why this culture of suspicion exists and to have an open discussion and exchange of ideas to overcome it.

00:20:00
In this section, Rocky Gerung discusses the interconnectedness of the world and how small events in other parts of the world can affect Indonesia's economy. He also discusses the possibility of a global war and how it may affect Indonesia. Gerung goes on to talk about Russia's past mistakes related to its theory of "lebensraum" or living space, and how this theory might lead countries to try to occupy Indonesia in the future. He then explores how people like Elon Musk view the world and how Twitter's censorship can go against the idea of democracy. Gerung contrasts this idea with Facebook and Instagram, which he believes support democracy.

00:25:00
In this section, speaker Rocky Gerung takes a stance on the issue of free speech and social media, stating that even in radical ideas, the ability to speak is a natural condition of humanity. However, social media platforms and governments create filters that hinder our ability to speak freely. He believes that free speech is a necessary component of democracy, as it allows for political debate and disagreement while also maintaining cultural integrity and respect. Despite being labeled as radical and fundamentalist, Gerung argues that creating dialogue with those who hold radical views is essential for deradicalization, as ideas will always meet with ideas.

00:30:00
In this section, Rocky Gerung speaks about the dangerous ideologies that have existed in Indonesia from the time of various kings, which led to the politics of revenge. He talks about the history of the Pajang Kingdom, where the rulers killed each other from behind, and the history of the Mataram Kingdom, where political transitions were always bloody and lacked democracy. He believes that this historical tendency to revenge still exists and is contributing to the political division and the inability for different ideas to converge. He argues that the language of binary code we use to analyze everything is probably part of the problem, and the algorithms that create polarization in our digital world are not helping. However, he also suggests that there might be underlying sociological and psychological problems as well.

00:35:00
In this section, Rocky Gerung discusses the issue of living in a dichotomous society and offers solutions on how to create a more colorful and diverse community. He believes there is a silent majority who choose to remain silent and not take sides amidst the polarization in Indonesia. Rocky suggests that as a society, we should focus on criticizing policies instead of individuals because solutions come from critiques. He also emphasizes the importance of looking at a person's policies and actions to determine if they are truly good-hearted, rather than just their appearance or reputation.

00:40:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the concept of beauty and diversity among different cultures, using the example of the Baduy tribe. The Baduy tribe considers natural asymmetry and diversity to be beautiful and sees no need for uniformity or standardization. The speaker also delves into the importance of intellectual discourse and debate, which is integral to human evolution. The next question posed to the speaker is about knowledge management and the contradiction between the concepts of personification and codification. The student asks how to implement both concepts positively without creating contradiction.

00:45:00
In this section, Rocky Gerung discusses the issue of Indonesia relying too much on figures rather than systems. He argues that Indonesia should focus on developing a good system that can be implemented and used by everyone with different backgrounds, while also creating better figures in the future. Gerung also talks about the difference between playing badminton, which requires technical skills and is determined by calculations, and playing kites, which requires ecological intelligence to catch the kite, not technical skills. He argues that Indonesia lacks ecological intelligence and is instead dominated by technical intelligence, which can cause confusion between personification and modification. Ultimately, Gerung believes that making decisions based on ecological conditions is important for enjoying life to the fullest.

00:50:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the importance of building conversations with clients through the "Harvard model" of decision making, which allows for the creation of a dialogue using ideas that may not have been previously considered. He notes that the country is divided between those who follow a personification mentality and those who follow a codification mentality, and that conversations cannot be limited to a specific structure, but rather should be flexible and creative. The speaker argues for a new way of thinking in Indonesia that blends both personification and codification, and suggests that this method can be applied to both business and politics.

00:55:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the concept of "personality politics" in democracies and how success can be measured based on the individual's personality or ability to institutionalize their party politics. He believes that while codification is initially rooted in routine, it must eventually become institutionalized to achieve a fusion of codification and personification. When a student asks how Indonesian youth can contribute to the country's future, the speaker emphasizes the importance of institutionalization and implores the younger generation to find ways to enter established structures and prevent them from becoming stagnant.

01:00:00
In this section, philosopher Rocky Gerung discusses the issue of the recent controversial appointment of Maudy Ayunda as a speaker at the G20 Summit and the broader implications for democracy. Gerung argues that the appointment reflects a lack of preparedness on the part of the Indonesian government and that the choice was made to appeal to Indonesian audiences rather than to represent the interests of the G20. Gerung then goes on to discuss the need for individuals to become more involved in politics and to challenge the options presented to them by those in power. Finally, Gerung posits a scenario in which machines become equal subjects in society and humans may ultimately be forced to compete with machines for political power and influence.

01:05:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the idea of objective function and how it is optimized based on input. Elon Musk's plan to buy Twitter with the intention of changing its objective function to match his interests is an example given. He questions whether it would be better to approach the objective function as something everyone should share and be able to debate democratically to include all interests. Additionally, the speaker wonders if objective function could be part of a decenralized web 3.0 that isn't owned by just big companies. The speaker then simulates a future conversation between a human and a robot about the concept of justice wherein Justice is defined as expenditure.

01:10:00
In this section of the video, philosopher Rocky Gerung discusses the concept of justice and how it is not simply a utilitarian calculation but is also about human emotions and the sense of injustice that people feel. He gives an example of a mother who only has 20,000 rupiahs in her wallet, and this causes her to feel injustice because it is not enough to buy her children food for a week. Gerung argues that people should be free to express their thoughts and ideas because freedom of thinking is a derivative of freedom of speech, which is a fundamental human right. He emphasizes that human beings are different from animals because of their rationality and that people must have the freedom to express their rational thoughts.

01:15:00
In this section, it is explained that humans are not just animals, but they are a specific type of animal that is differentiated by their ability to think, evaluate their existential conditions and use language. Humans are given the status of a legal subject in society. However, in Indonesia, the law is often not accessible to all people equally, which is a result of a flawed education system that promotes feudalism and hinders progress. The solution to this is to evaluate and reform the curriculum so that everyone has equal access to the law and to achieve freedom, they should be able to join a political party.

01:20:00
In this section of the video, Rocky Gerung emphasizes the importance of critical thinking in upholding our status as humans and not regressing to animalistic behavior. He also discusses the need to defend against leadership by incompetent individuals and clarifies that revolution for the sake of change is not the same as rebellion, as demonstrated by an example involving coconut shells and taxes. Later, a question is asked on how to reignite pluralism and democratic discussions, as well as how to approach environmental ethics without being too polarizing. Rocky stresses the importance of ethically expressing differences of opinion without being insulting, as it is a hallmark of human capability.

01:25:00
In this section, Rocky Gerung discusses the concept of cross-cutting in politics and the importance of overlapping consensus. He provides examples such as a non-Muslim person choosing a Muslim president who is not corrupt instead of a non-Muslim president who is corrupt. He also points out the need to appreciate and respect the inner logic and existence of non-human beings, such as trees, and their role in ecological systems. He further explains that the damming of rivers for electricity production can disrupt ecological systems and harm communities that depend on them.

01:30:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the importance of ecological thinking and considering the source of protein that sustains a community's livelihood. He questions the motives behind the creation of micro power plants, which may be used to supply electricity to a village but ultimately lead to the loss of protein for the next generation. The speaker suggests that political and economic factors should be considered when analyzing these types of projects and that it's essential to examine who benefits from them and who is behind their implementation. Additionally, he highlights the lack of vision and preparedness in local government officials and suggests that they should be trained to think more strategically about the future of their communities.

01:35:00
In this section, philosopher Rocky Gerung discusses the importance of dialectics in the current state of the world. He notes that the winners of Nobel prizes in the past 23 years have mostly come from the "Justice cool" region. He also highlights the issue of money circulation in the world, which has led to confusion about whether it will result in justice or merely facilitate the accumulation of wealth in new forms such as crypto or types of guarantees that will emerge later. Gerung surmises that our short-term decision-making abilities must be enhanced by using technology to project and measure future outcomes, especially since technology is constantly evolving and we can easily fall behind.

01:40:00
In this section, several participants ask questions and express concerns regarding the state of education and democracy in Indonesia. One person asks about the difficulty of integrating a reading culture with education character, while another raises concern about the distortion of the fundamental purpose of education in some higher education recruitment efforts. Other questions revolve around the possible disruption of society by the rise of robots and how this might affect the dynamics of democracy.

01:45:00
In this section, the speaker explains that humans are the ones responsible for damaging the Earth, not natural disasters. The problem lies in human policies, which is called anthropocene in geology, indicating the scale of Earth's destruction designed by humans. The urgency then arises from this realization, which can be tackled through reading about current and futuristic concepts, such as diversity, and projecting them to see how they can be present in the future. By doing so, humans can prepare for habits in new situations and gain insights into developing technologies like robots.

01:50:00
In this section, Rocky Gerung discusses the importance of reading and how it allows us to remember the past and create projections for the future. He emphasizes the need for caution in projecting into the future, as technology can lead us astray. He also talks about the need for a challenge to stimulate discussions among young people. Finally, Gerung presents the issue of nation-building and the importance of balancing power and talent. He argues that Indonesia's political system has too much dispersion and money politics, and that the limited budget for talent creates a dilemma for the country.

01:55:00
In this section, Rocky Gerung discusses two structural obstacles that hinder the quality of education and talent development in Indonesia. Firstly, the decentralization of education has not been as optimal as desired, leading to an unequal distribution of resources and talent. Secondly, the country's economic growth has been too sentripetal, with most of the development centered in Jabodetabek instead of other regions. To address these issues, Gerung suggests finding the right balance between power and talent, citing Lee Kuan Yu as an example of a leader who surrounded himself with like-minded, highly-intellectual, and trustworthy individuals. Furthermore, cross-institutional fertilization is crucial, and leaders must learn to encourage divergent ideas and conversations that promote democratization of thought.

02:00:00
In this section, Rocky Gerung explains the correlation between divergent thinking and innovation, ideas, and creativity. In his view, the more ideas and innovations we have, the better we can institutionalize and grow the institutions we lead. This knowledge is crucial for the future leaders of Indonesia who attended the Endgame Lyceum Vol. 2 event and had the chance to meet prominent figures like Rocky Gerung. The students were grateful for the opportunity to meet Rocky Gerung, whose speeches and game shows they have followed with enthusiasm.
