In this section of the video, Sabrang Mowo Damar Panuluh, also known as Sabrang "Noe" Letto, discusses the concept of gotong-royong, which is mutual cooperation in Indonesian society. He explains that social status is a side effect of the ability to solve problems in a small community, which is exemplified by their ancestors. However, with modern technology, people no longer solve problems to increase their social status; they focus on showing off their wealth and creating sensations. The conversation then shifts to Sabrang's childhood and his experience of being in Canada during the monetary crisis in Indonesia in 1998. He talks about how he had to survive by doing anything to make ends meet, including sleeping in a phone booth, and how this experience taught him valuable life lessons.

In this section, Sabrang Mowo Damar Panuluh discusses his academic background and how he became interested in studying mathematics, physics, and psychology. He explains that he was drawn to the stability and fundamental nature of these subjects, as well as his desire to comprehend how things work. After initially considering pursuing a career in science, he took a break and discovered his passion for music by analyzing famous songs and identifying patterns. Although he had no prior musical background, he found it intriguing how music could influence our internal reality, and went on to form the band Letto.

00:10:00
In this section, the speakers discuss the importance of generalist knowledge compared to specialization in today’s era. They indicate that although industries such as coding have become specialized, the importance of generalist knowledge in mitigating risk in the long term is critical. The paradigm of reductionism which was used for 300 years to produce specialized disciplines and great things now poses issues in cases where it’s essential to see relationships as a whole system. The speakers suggest that learning to think in a system-oriented way will ultimately become increasingly valuable in the future. It is argued that generalists are needed, and more specific tasks will undoubtedly be taken over by machines.

00:15:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the importance of generalists in the future as machines take over specific tasks. However, the speaker also emphasizes the need for specialization and generalization to achieve stability in the future. The conversation then shifts to the quality of teachers, with the speaker arguing that current teaching methodologies are obsolete and based on outdated assumptions about intellectual stratification. Instead, the speaker advocates for a more flexible and decentralized approach to education in which everyone can become a teacher and everywhere is school. Such an approach would foster a love of learning and enable individuals to continuously upgrade their skills in a rapidly changing world.

00:20:00
In this section, the speakers discuss the need for a revolutionary change in education. They note that the current system is limited and ineffective at differentiating between competent and less competent individuals. They advocate for the democratization of education, not just the democratization of information. Additionally, they point out the importance of creating structures and mental models that can help establish patterns in ideas and events, driving change from within. Despite this, they express their frustration at the lack of progress in democratizing ideas in Indonesia.

00:25:00
In this section, the speakers discuss the need to identify patterns and underlying causes to make changes in society. They talk about addiction caused by technology and how democratisation of ideas is hindered due to it. The speakers suggest treating the addiction and giving people unfamiliar information to reduce this effect. They also mention how social media relies on a model of profitability and how people who cannot contribute positively are often neglected. The need for a place for people to improve and learn, especially for the 10%, who are most affected by neglect, is also emphasised.

00:30:00
In this section of the video, Sabrang Mowo Damar Panuluh discusses the difficulty in finding someone who is willing to make a change to society without a desire for big profits, as most people within the top hierarchy are concerned with profitability. He suggests that with the financial cost of elections, significant changes could be made instead if candidates focused on certain leverage points within society. However, it is challenging to find someone with visions towards society and who is well-qualified to go into politics. Additionally, credibility is essential in science, which is incompatible in the political world, as the most important thing is how to finish a task within a few weeks. Despite this, Sabrang believes that the mental model of people serious with the knowledge they have may be incompatible within the political world, but it is not a dead end.

00:35:00
In this section, Sabrang Mowo Damar Panuluh discusses the importance of having a structure that can mediate the credibility of politicians to society. While it may be difficult for people in the world of science and data to throw away their credibility by entering politics, a structure that can facilitate the acknowledgment of a politician's expertise and competence to society can bring change. However, the current lack of such a structure presents a problem, and the angle of attack has not been thought through. To bridge the gap between the world of science and politics, there must be a democratization of ideas and knowledge, and education must be provided to those who vote so that they can understand what is best for the wider community. One experiment that Sabrang conducted for the 2009 election showed that people's logical choices were affected by their lack of understanding and diversity in knowledge.

00:40:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the importance of creating a systematic way of determining the value of candidates, particularly in terms of their expertise. He emphasizes the need for a method that considers expert views from all perspectives and can be easily understood by all individuals regardless of their IQ level. He also connects this idea to the concept of democracy, suggesting that democracy is about control and optimal decision-making, and that people need to have more control in the democratic system. He argues that the current system has created a syndicate, a group of people with the same goal of benefiting themselves, and that technology, particularly blockchain, could be a contender for improving the democratic system in the future.

00:45:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the concept of democratization and the need to empower individuals who are not in government or regulation but have expertise in their respective fields. He talks about the idea of "gotong-royong," which means mutual cooperation, and explains how it was utilized in the past to improve social status through problem-solving. He then highlights the need for social proof in modern technology to solve problems incrementally. The speaker also mentions the concept of fluid democracy and the use of AI representation for decision-making, stating that technologically, society is not structured enough for it. However, he believes that the direction towards distributed power is good and mentions the growth rate of blockchain applications, hypothesizing that it will not only be correlated with finance but also democratisation.

00:50:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the potential for blockchain and tokenization to expand beyond the financial industry and into other domains. He asserts that social reengineering, political reengineering, and economic reengineering will be necessary to fully utilize the transparency, decentralization, and accountability benefits of blockchain technology. The speaker suggests that with tokenization, even human aspects can be represented and that the possibilities for blockchain are vast and potentially explosive, especially since the growth of blockchain technology has been 120% per year for the past decade. The speaker argues that tokenization can make things very explosive in society, and that it amplifies the human aspect.

00:55:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the distribution of trust as a fundamental value in society and its potential tokenization through Bitcoin. He notes that by using Bitcoin for transactions, it indirectly de-risks conventional currency and results in an unprecedented level of trust across political, social, cultural, and psychological currencies. The speaker then talks about the importance of institutional building for democracy and emphasizes the significance of the credibility of the perpetrators in any political system. He suggests that credibility can only be monitored by a few people, and everyone must have a few people around them who can testify to their social contributions, which can be tokenized for elections as a basis of trust.

01:00:00
In this section, Sabrang Mowo Damar Panuluh discusses the need to build social tokens in Indonesia and around the world. He believes that credible sources for information are needed and that ideas should be decentralized so that people can give out social tokens. He points out the differences between the Western system of free expression and the Chinese system of control, and suggests that Indonesia needs to find its own system for social credit that is compatible with its resources and ecology. He believes that social credit can be built from the emergence below, and that it must be egalitarian and decentralized.

01:05:00
In this section, Sabrang Mowo Damar Panuluh talks about his vision for Indonesia in 2045, which he hopes to achieve through his creation of social media that incorporates two ideas: a token of impact and amplifying brain power. He believes that this infrastructure will assist people in upgrading themselves according to their capacities and wishes, and in solving problems, everyone will get social credit if they do something. Panuluh favors neither optimism nor pessimism, preferring instead to use metrics based on complete data to anticipate what will happen, and to act only if there is a chance of success.

01:10:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the importance of addressing the limit of growth in society, which has been predicted to lead to collapse if we continue with business as usual. The three plots identified by the 1972 MIT study include business as usual, comprehensive technology, and a stabilized world. The key to sustainability is investing in education, health, and innovation to stabilize growth and hierarchies such as wealth, social status, and intelligence. Tokenization from social credit is the solution, as people have grown, and the speaker believes there's no other way to survive civilization without this approach. Optimism needs calculation, and it's essential to produce impacts and store the value of what we do.

01:15:00
In this section of the video, the speaker discusses the importance of risk management and avoiding naive optimism, using the example of the COVID-19 pandemic as a black swan event that could have been anticipated. They express optimism for Indonesia in 2045 but emphasize the need for constructive and positive disruption to drive change. The speaker highlights the importance of crafting a calculated evolution for Indonesia to become a key player on the world stage, with a focus on human resources and taking advantage of the country's demographic bonus before it is too late.

01:20:00
In this section, Sabrang Mowo Damar Panuluh discusses the importance of investment based on certain information and the risks posed by information asymmetry. He notes that the lack of democratization of ideas is structural and that democratizing ideas requires the democratization of information acquisition and comprehension. Sabrang introduces SymbolicID as a way to develop a social comprehension method for acquiring and comprehending information. In terms of his endgame, he wants to create an effective conversion system to help people convert their potential into actualization to make the biggest impact on society. Sabrang sees this as a continuous evolution throughout the ages that can make our era more appealing.

01:25:00
In this section, Sabrang Mowo Damar Panuluh discusses the need for a bridge between civilizations to combat the intense breakup between the US and China. He suggests that civilization, such as Europe and Southeast Asia including Indonesia, has existed for thousands of years and can act as a bridge logically. He believes that Indonesia is rich in different civilizations and the conversion from diversity to potential could make Indonesia an adaptive civilization to face ever-changing problems. Sabrang emphasizes that adaptability is crucial for the long-term war and the technological development adds more value to many civilizations.
