In this section, geologist Amando Lasabuda discusses the contribution of humans versus nature in regards to climate change. He explains that while humans have played a significant role in global warming and reducing carbon emissions is everyone's responsibility, from individuals to governments, it's important to recognize that the majority of carbon in the atmosphere comes from nature, specifically events that occurred millions of years ago. He mentions studying the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) which happened 56 million years ago when the earth was 5-8 degrees Celsius warmer, and how it is essential to reconcile both sides of the climate change discourse. While acknowledging that human impact on the environment needs to be intervened, he also highlights that significant damage to the environment occurred before humans, such as from volcanoes.

In this section of the video, Amando Lasabuda discusses Norway's plan to become carbon neutral by 2030 and its reliance on renewable energy sources. Despite being a major producer of fossil fuels, Norway has shifted its focus towards non-fossil fuel energy for its own use while selling its fossil fuel products to other countries. Lasabuda attributes Norway's success to its practical and rational approach, as well as the smaller population size that makes it easier to manage. However, he also notes the paradox of sustainability narratives mostly being promoted by a minority while the majority of the world's population is still struggling to meet basic needs. Thus, he emphasizes the need for a modernization narrative to help developing countries, such as Indonesia and India, to catch up with the rest of the world in terms of energy development.

In this section, the speaker discusses the challenges facing developing countries like India and Indonesia in reaching electrification levels of 5,000 kWh per person. Currently, these countries are only at around 1,000 kWh per person and would need to increase their capacity five-fold to reach the 5,000 kWh target. The speaker mentions that this would take around 90 years, which presents a challenge for sustainability given that the target year is only 27 years away. The speaker notes that there is a need to reconcile the modernization narrative with sustainability goals and that this is a challenge for practitioners and scholars to resolve. Additionally, the speaker discusses his research work in Australia, which involves modeling geological patterns and sediment transport in the Arctic in relation to climate change impacts.

00:25:00
In this section, Amando Lasabuda talks about his experiences studying the Arctic, particularly in the Barents Sea and Svalbard, where he conducted geological research and data collection. His hypothesis regarding this study is that understanding the past and present geology of the Arctic can provide reliable inputs for modeling future climate change and its effects. He also notes the difficulty in making sustainable changes to our lifestyles, despite growing concern for environmental issues like global warming, which is reflected in the difference between the number of followers for Greta Thunberg and Kylie Jenner on Instagram. This suggests a lack of education about the environment and the low capacity of countries to modernize and ensure food security.

00:30:00
In this section, geologist Amando Lasabuda discusses the challenges faced by Indonesia in terms of promoting a new mindset and educating scholars to think differently in the 21st century. Despite the difficulties of life in Indonesia, Lasabuda highlights the positive attitude and confidence of Indonesian scientists studying abroad to contribute to their homeland once they have obtained enough knowledge and experience overseas. Rather than fearing brain drain, Lasabuda believes it is beneficial to have more Indonesians studying abroad, as they will bring back valuable knowledge and contribute to the education level of the society in the long term. He also emphasizes the importance of establishing a positive image of Indonesia through success stories of Indonesian scientists abroad.

00:35:00
In this section, Amando Lasabuda discusses the importance of open access to geological data and collaboration among stakeholders in addressing climate change.

He advocates for a more confident and vocal attitude among Indonesians, as well as more openness to joint research with universities and teachers in the country. Lasabuda also shares his endgame as a scientist, which is to continue his research on climate change and scale it up to a global level, while remaining open to eventually returning to Indonesia to contribute to the country's progress.

00:50:00
In this section, scientist Amando Lasabuda talks about the importance of international collaborations between foreign and Indonesian institutions to accelerate the transfer of knowledge. Through speaking with a professor in America, Lasabuda discovered that a lot of scholars and researchers in Indonesia face difficulty collaborating with foreign institutions. However, if they knew someone who already held a professorship in the relevant university, the collaboration would be much easier. Lasabuda believes investing in education, like pursuing a PhD abroad, is worth the cost and that if someone is smart, they will find funding. He also discusses the issue of Indonesia's dwindling book-reading culture and suggests academics use social media to disseminate their research for a wider audience.
