In this section, the speaker, Gita Wirjawan, discusses Southeast Asia and how it often gets underrated compared to China and India. He talks briefly about the history of humanity and the changes that have occurred from the conversion of soil to steel to data. He also notes that the acceleration of technology is causing concern, particularly in developing economies like Indonesia where government officials and regulators may not be able to keep up with the pace of change, which could lead to disruptions and dislocations. Finally, he mentions multi-polarization and Indonesia's decision not to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

In this section of the video, Gita Wirjawan discusses the missed opportunity for Indonesia to join the TPP due to the focus being on intellectualizing the conversation rather than popularizing it. He goes on to talk about the serious risks of climate change and the decline of the price of money due to demographics. He encourages graduates to attach their great ideas to cheaper capital as countries like the US, Japan, and Europe have done with quantitative easing. However, countries like Indonesia are not experiencing the same declination of money, and reflationary policies may be on the horizon.

00:10:00
In this section, the speaker discusses Southeast Asia and its composition of ten countries with a population of 620-630 million and a 2.5-2.6 trillion dollar economy, making it the fourth or fifth largest economy in the world. The region's history has been graced by Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, and colonialism in the past two millennia. Despite this, it has stayed peaceful and stable, fostering robust economic growth over the past 30-40 years. The combination of global and regional narratives, such as the One Belt, One Road initiative and a tendency towards increasing interest rates to confront reflationary tendencies, will play a significant role in Southeast Asia's future. Additionally, the speaker notes that significant opportunities lie in the financial technology sector as Southeast Asia's financial inclusiveness is only at around 36 percent.

00:15:00
In this section, Gita Wirjawan explains that Southeast Asia's political and economic landscape has been shifting towards defined contribution, where individuals are required to contribute and put skin in the game to get what they want. This shift has been affecting many countries in Southeast Asia and could lead to a change in global supply chains. Unlike the European Union, Southeast Asia is not unionized fiscally, immigration-wise, or monetarily. However, the region has been able to stay cohesive politically and socially, despite differing GDPs and growth rates, thanks to the ASEAN Plaza Architecture, which has helped foster peace and stability.

00:20:00
In this section, we learn that Southeast Asiaâ€™s trade only represents roughly 10% of the global trade, which translates to about 3.4% of the global GDP. Trade numbers are likely to grow due to demographics within the region, the population of which is set to reach close to 200 million in the middle class in the next couple of years. Southeast Asia is viewed as significant in terms of a global supply chain because about 10% of global trade occurs in this region, which accounts for $2.5tn worth of goods and services that traverse through it yearly.

00:25:00
In this section, Gita Wirjawan discusses Southeast Asia's trade relationships and its position in the value chain. Despite being a $2.5 to $2.6 trillion economy, Southeast Asia only trades with each other to the extent of 24-25% of total trade. China is the region's biggest trading partner, making up 14% of total trade but the need to focus on trading more between Southeast Asian countries is crucial if they want to move up the value chain fast enough in the coming years or decades. Additionally, the market cap of Singapore's stock market to GDP ratio is close to 200 percent, whereas Indonesia stands at only 46 percent, meaning countries like Indonesia need to extend their liquidity avenues if they want anyone with great ideas and entrepreneurial skills to attach themselves to capital.

00:30:00
In this section, Gita Wirjawan discusses the debt to GDP ratios of Southeast Asian countries and how they have been able to cap their deficits and borrow more disciplined. Singapore has great ability to service its leverage, while Indonesia used to borrow at close to 100% of its GDP 20 years ago, and now they have been able to knock it down to about 24-25% through the implementation of laws. Gita also emphasizes the importance of increasing productivity in Southeast Asian countries to move up the value chain and successfully compete with other countries such as China, which is projected to grow its middle class by 150.

00:35:00
In this section, Gita Wirjawan discusses the importance of railroads and roadways for businesses in Southeast Asia. He suggests that ride-sharing companies should focus on countries like Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam due to their large populations and high levels of traffic. However, to pursue the last-mile business model propositions for these countries, an increase in railroads is necessary. Currently, the number of kilometers of railroads per 1 million people is significantly less than China's which could be a problem in scaling up business models. Additionally, Wirjawan discusses how the fiscal space creation and greater internet penetration should boost the region's economy.

00:40:00
In this section, Gita Wirjawan speaks about the need for higher education in Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia, where only 20% of smartphone users have adequate capabilities. He explains that with the mandated 20% of the budget for educational purposes, the country will be spending between three to five trillion dollars on education in the next 27 years. This would enable Southeast Asia to become a part of the global supply chain while boosting education levels. Wirjawan also emphasizes that the country should market its directionality rather than absolutes, which would inspire optimism in foreign investors.

00:45:00
In this section, Gita Wirjawan discusses the potential of Southeast Asia in the global supply chain. With a PPP-adjusted GDP of $330 trillion, ASEAN is set to become a relevant member of the international community. The digital readiness of ASEAN countries and financial inclusion is also promising, with Indonesia's financial inclusion rate expected to grow rapidly in the coming years. Infrastructure and education spending will drive growth and development, and with these investments, Indonesia is looking to achieve 4 doctors per 1000 people and a 95% financial inclusion rate. Ultimately, ASEAN is well-poised to become an anchor of peace and stability for the region and project soft power beyond at the international level.

00:50:00
In this section, Gita Wirjawan discusses how Indonesia is well-positioned to be a middle power and bridge the gap between various regions due to its geographic and geopolitical neutrality. He also highlights the country's potential for growth in various areas, such as transportation infrastructure, tourism, and fintech. Wirjawan explains that with better financial instruments and local investment, the fintech space in Southeast Asia can attract more foreign capital, including those from large companies like Tencent and Softbank. Additionally, Wirjawan believes that with more international tourists coming in, the hospitality industry in Indonesia will also grow significantly.

00:55:00
In this section, the focus is on the ride-sharing players in Southeast Asia, Grab and Gojek. Grab has consolidated with Uber and has a 20-25% stake in the combined entity. Each of the two players has about 10 million users out of the 50-60 million urban population, representing a significant upside for growth, especially since Indonesia is critical to their success in Southeast Asia. However, further consolidation could lead to anti-trust and competition issues, and policymakers must understand the changes that are likely to occur in the tech industry. Despite this, the outlook for supply chain in Southeast Asia is bullish, as the region is likely to experience peace and stability and benefit from the One Belt, One Road narrative, which could attract private investment and drive growth in the region's fiscal space.

01:00:00
In this section, former Indonesian Trade Minister Gita Wirjawan cautions against pushing too hard for regional integration in Asia as it may lead to trade diversion. He stresses the importance of finding a proper place in one of the global supply chains for each Asian country and going up the product ladder one rung at a time. The extent to which a country decides on having special trade and monetary relationships with others should depend on the niche in one of these global value chains. Wirjawan also emphasizes the need to ensure access to capital, especially for small and medium entrepreneurs in Indonesia.

01:05:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the issues faced by small and medium-sized businesses in Southeast Asia, stating that lack of access to capital is the root cause of stagnation in the entrepreneurship space. The speaker goes on to talk about the importance of financial inclusion and how it will change the game for not only small and medium-sized businesses but also big enterprises. The speaker also touches upon multilateral conversations and the issue of populism that has hindered progress in the past. However, the speaker is optimistic about the future of multilateral conversations as the degree to which populism sells is likely to decline with the rise of inflationary tendencies in developed and emerging economies.

01:10:00
In this section, Gita Wirjawan discusses how Southeast Asian countries may choose to follow China's example to move up the value chain and advance economically. He notes that Southeast Asian economies have a history of copying and pasting pre-existing business models from China, which makes it likely that they will follow China's lead in moving towards developing coding capabilities. He emphasizes the importance of investing in education and getting more people to learn about coding so that these economies can jump one or two echelons of the value chain. Wirjawan also acknowledges that there may be some leakage in the way money is being spent on education, but he remains optimistic that there is likely to be less leakage going forward.

01:15:00
In this section, Gita Wirjawan discusses the challenges of establishing south-south trade relations and how it's easier to move goods and services north-south. He predicts that the likelihood of Indonesia joining a Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is high as the country wants to become a multilateralist. Wirjawan also emphasizes the importance of regional cooperation in Asia and how frequent meetings between nations help to foster mutual respect and understanding. He notes that the slowness of progress in the region can actually be an advantage in maintaining stability and peace. Lastly, he touches on the potential benefits of real estate investment trusts in Indonesia due to the growing tourism industry.

01:20:00
In this section, Gita Wirjawan discussed the potential role of real estate investment trusts (REITs) in Southeast Asia's development story. He noted that Thailand is ahead of Indonesia in capitalizing on REIT opportunities due to its ability to justify the necessary cap rates demanded by investors. Wirjawan expressed that the development story needs to produce the necessary substory line of having adequate cap rates and good governance to encourage investors to invest in REITs. He also mentioned that the necessary rental stories for REIT opportunities are not happening enough of a scale in Indonesia outside Jakarta, but the landscape could improve in the next five years.
