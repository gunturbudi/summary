In this section, the speaker discusses the clashes between different fields of study such as science and religion, and how a holistic approach to development is necessary. He then goes on to explore the potential of technology to combine spirituality and modernity, such as using avatars to bring back historical figures like Mahatma Gandhi or even religious leaders to give sermons in mosques. However, he also warns of the importance of not simply seeing this as a means to fulfill our obligations, but to also approach it with genuine sincerity and intention.

In this section, the speaker discusses the importance of fulfilling the obligatory aspect of religious practices while also reflecting on their spiritual value. He points out that while technology and digital developments offer new challenges to religion, they also provide opportunities for the development of spiritual infrastructure. This is reflected in his own use of YouTube for dakwah and the example of the robot monk in Japan. Ultimately, he argues that religion is about spirituality, which cannot be fully accommodated by digital developments, and that the value of digital infrastructure lies in its ability to facilitate the development of spiritual suprastructure.

In this section, the speaker discusses the limitations of AI and technology and how it should be used constructively to solve problems that humans cannot. While technology like AI can be helpful in some ways, it is still created by humans and cannot be a replacement for human creators or spirituality. The speaker warns against becoming too reliant on technology and alienating ourselves from our true human selves, as seen in cases where people act differently online than in person. The speaker emphasizes the need for technology to be used in a constructive and ethical way, rather than as a tool for destruction or to replace human values.

In this section, the speaker discusses the potential dangers of relying too heavily on artificial intelligence (AI) without understanding its moral compass. While machines may be able to create their own programs, they still lack the proper ethical considerations that humans can provide. Though ontologically machines will always be subordinate to humans, there is still cause for concern as we risk being controlled and manipulated by them because of our own desires and natures. The speaker emphasizes the importance of holistic discussions and interdisciplinary dialogues about the intersections of technology, spirituality, and ethics to prevent a dystopian future.

In this section, the speaker discusses the possibility of gene editing and the potential impact it could have on the already existing clash between artificial intelligence and spiritual intelligence. The main issue lies in ego-driven sectors of society, such as scientists and theologians, who fail to engage in interdepartmental discourse and instead clash with one another. The speaker suggests that a holistic approach to development, rooted in a fundamental understanding of philosophy, is necessary to regulate and control both personal and collective thinking. The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of "musyawarah," or consultation, as a means of achieving this holistic development.
