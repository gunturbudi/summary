In this section, the speakers discuss the challenges of navigating the digital age and its impact on mental health. They note that social media has led to polarisation in conversations, particularly among young people, intellectuals, and in the context of liberal democracies. Empirically, this polarisation correlates with unhealthy mental health phenomena such as depression, anxiety and suicide, affecting both developed and developing countries. Despite these challenges, the speakers view this as a blessing as it allows individuals to be tested in their faith and truth-seeking abilities during this transitional phase. The speakers suggest building bridges and creating a new set of ethics to navigate this new era.

In this section, the speaker discusses the potential risks associated with promoting spirituality in modern times, particularly when it comes to mental health. While religion has been known to provide positive implications for mental health, some studies have found that it can also become a source of anxiety and depression when it is approached primarily as a dogmatic practice. The speaker emphasizes the importance of practicing spirituality as an intrinsic part of one's life rather than a set of strict rules or rituals, and encourages people to cultivate a positive and constructive perspective in order to avoid polarizing or extreme views.

In this section, it is discussed how religion can play a significant role in promoting mental health. The importance of finding meaning in life is emphasized, as lack of meaning can lead to depression and suicidal thoughts. Viktor Frankl, a psychologist who survived the Nazi concentration camp, suggests that religion can give people a sense of purpose and meaning. However, it is also crucial to be aware that religion should not overrun psychology's role in mental health. Additionally, social media's impact on mental health is mentioned, with increased anxiety, depression, and suicide rates being linked to reduced historical knowledge and weakened cognitive immunity in the post-truth era.

In this section, the speaker discusses the importance of collaboration between psychologists and religious leaders when it comes to the mental health of their patients' religious beliefs. He notes that injecting religious values into a patient's treatment may potentially worsen their condition if the psychologist is not an expert in the religion. He suggests that religious teachings can be valuable sources of meaning and history, and that one key component to developing a strong mental state is self-awareness. He explains that knowing oneself and finding one's own sources of joy and entertainment can be helpful in developing a healthy mental state.

In this section, the speakers discuss the fundamental problem of modern humans, which is their lack of self-awareness, leading to an inability to address their mental and spiritual issues. They argue that doctors and psychologists can only help to a certain extent if individuals do not know themselves well. The example of people following diets or religious practices without knowing what's best for them personally is given, highlighting the importance of self-reflection and self-awareness in improving mental and spiritual health.
