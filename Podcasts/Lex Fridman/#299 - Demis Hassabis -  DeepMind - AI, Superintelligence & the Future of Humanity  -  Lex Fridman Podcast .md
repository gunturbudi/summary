In this conversation with Demis Hassabis, CEO and co-founder of DeepMind, they discuss the Turing test, protein folding, and the future of artificial intelligence. Hassabis believes that the Turing test is not a rigorous enough measure of intelligence and that instead, we should be testing AI capabilities on a range of tasks to see if they reach human level or above performance.

00:05:00
In this excerpt, Demis Hassabis talks about how he fell in love with programming at a young age, and how he believes that computers are a magical extension of our minds. He also talks about how he believes that the Turing Test will be the ultimate benchmark for measuring artificial intelligence.

00:10:00
Demis Hassabis discusses his early interest in chess and game programming, and how this led him to develop a keen interest in AI. He describes how he wrote his first AI program to play the game of Othello, and how this experience led him to develop a career in AI and game design.

00:15:00
The speaker discusses how games can be used to develop and test AI algorithms, and how this has been a core component of DeepMind's vision from the beginning. He also talks about how games are a unique medium that can be used to explore philosophical concepts like good and evil, and how the success of DeepMind was due in part to their use of games.

00:20:00
In this podcast, Demis Hassabis talks about his journey in AI, from the perspective of both a creator and a player. He reflects on the historic moment when Deep Blue beat Kasparov at chess, and how that made him think more about the mind of a grandmaster than the machine. He goes on to discuss the design of chess, and how the tension between the bishop and the knight is what makes the game so compelling. Finally, he addresses the question of whether AI systems can design games that are optimally compelling to humans.

00:25:00
Demis Hassabis believes that AI is capable of interpolation and extrapolation, but not true invention. He thinks that one day AI will be able to invent games like chess or go, but that there is still something missing in terms of high-level concepts or abstractions that they truly understand.

00:30:00
In this interview, Demis Hassabis discusses his belief that the universe is best understood as an information universe, and that this means we might be living in a simulation. He also talks about his disagreement with Roger Penrose on the nature of consciousness, and his belief that all of the magic of the human mind can be explained by classical computation.

00:35:00
Demis Hassabis, of DeepMind, talks about how AI can help unlock the mysteries of the human mind by building intelligent artifacts and investigating them scientifically.

00:40:00
In this podcast interview, Demis Hassabis discusses the development of Alpha Fold, a machine learning system that can predict the 3D structure of proteins from their amino acid sequence. He describes how this system revolutionizes the work of structural biologists, who no longer have to rely on painstaking experimental methods to determine protein structures. Hassabis also talks about the origins of life and the role of proteins in biology.

00:45:00

He discusses the challenges that were faced in building the system, the importance of making it end-to-end, and the evolution of the Alpha series of machine learning systems.

00:50:00
In the early days of DeepMind, ideas were the most important factor in their success. Algorithmic advances in deep learning and reinforcement learning, along with a better understanding of the human brain, allowed them to build systems that were far ahead of their time. Today, DeepMind is still at the forefront of AI research, and their work is helping to pave the way for artificial general intelligence.

00:55:00
In this podcast, Demis Hassabis discusses his belief that engineering and data are key to solving intelligence, and that reinforcement learning is a powerful tool for doing so. He also talks about DeepMind's multi-disciplinary approach to innovation, and how he sees it as a way to foster new discoveries in biology and other fields.

01:40:00
In the YouTube video "Demis Hassabis: DeepMind - AI, Superintelligence & the Future of Humanity | Lex Fridman Podcast #299", Demis Hassabis discusses the possibility of artificial intelligence (AI) systems becoming sentient. He states that consciousness and intelligence are "double dissociable" and that it is possible to have one without the other. He also says that building AI systems which are not conscious to begin with may be the best way to explore the mystery of consciousness.

01:45:00
Demis Hassabis discusses the philosophical implications of artificial intelligence, specifically concerning consciousness and sentience. He argues that AI systems will never be able to fully replicate human experience due to substrate differences, and that this will present a challenge when trying to determine whether or not AI systems are sentient. He also raises the question of what responsibility AI systems have to help those who believe they are sentient, and whether or not it is ethical to create systems that could potentially fake sentience.
