Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Glenn Loury talks about the history of race and inequality in America, and how the idea of equality is important to him. He speaks about how slavery was not just a legal system, but also a social system with a lot of symbolism attached to it. He talks about how, in 1963, 100 years after the Declaration of Independence was signed, King speaks about the idea of equality as members of the nation as free and equal citizens.

00:05:00
In his 1963 speech at the March on Washington, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke about the basic worth of all human beings, regardless of race or ethnicity. This speech is important in the context of the Civil Rights Movement, which aimed to ensure equal rights for blacks in the United States. King's humanitarian views are also evident in his work after the 1963 speech, which included developing strategies for fighting against poverty and health care disparities.

00:10:00
Glenn Loury discusses the history of slavery in the United States, and how it reflects on the capacity of humans to overlook unethical and morally problematic practices. He also asks what we are looking the other way on today, and whether or not most people were able to convince themselves that slavery was wrong over time.

00:15:00
Glenn Loury discusses the history and prevalence of slavery, noting that it is not a uniquely American phenomenon. He points out that abolitionism took a long time to develop, and that it was only after a series of crises that led to the end of slavery.

00:20:00
In the video, Glenn Loury discusses the history of slavery and its eventual eradication, and how this progress was made possible by the power of individual rebellion. He also emphasizes the importance of equality today, and talks about how one person can make a difference in the fight for social justice.

00:25:00
Glenn Loury argues that fairness does not imply equality of outcomes, and that different groups have different cultural orientations that lead to different social outcomes. He predicts that the Boston Celtics will win the NBA Finals.

00:30:00
In this video, University of Michigan economics professor Glenn Loury discusses the importance of opportunity in determining outcomes, and how social conditions play a role in opportunity. He also discusses affirmative action, and how it can be empowering or limiting for certain groups.

00:35:00
Glenn Loury discusses the concept of opportunity, which includes factors such as whether employers treat workers fairly, the development of skills, and exposure to cultural values.

00:40:00
Glenn Loury discusses the difficulty of reducing disparities between races in the United States, and argues that economics can provide a valuable perspective on social issues. He describes his love of mathematics and its ability to address questions of social significance in an abstract way.

00:45:00
In this video, mathematician Glenn Loury discusses the challenges of mathematics, which parallel the challenges of economics. He explains that one of the goals of mathematics is to find generalizable truths about the world, which is a difficult task.

00:50:00
Glenn Loury discusses the difference between macro and microeconomics, highlighting the importance of aggregating data to make generalizations.

He goes on to discuss the concept of general equilibrium, and how it can only be achieved through the use of certain mathematical concepts. Finally, he discusses the importance of markets being made up of individuals, and how formalizing these interactions can lead to true, but imperfect, results.

00:55:00
Glenn Loury discusses the reality of race, which depends upon assumptions that themselves may not hold. He argues that the formalization of the social sciences is better than the intuition because it allows for a more rigorous analysis of human interaction. He also argues that groupings of people into nations, races, and other categories are not useful in understanding human nature.

01:00:00
Glenn Loury discusses the idea that race, racism, and identity politics play a role in who people are perceived as and how they are treated by society.

01:10:00
Glenn Loury discusses the importance of identity and culture, and how tribalism allows for the telling of a story to one's children and the growth of a culture. He discusses the history of black Americans and how they are a population of people who come into existence in North America through the cauldron of slavery and through the arrival of immigrants from various parts of the world. He touches on the importance of identity and how it can provide a sense of community and tradition.

01:15:00

Malcolm X is seen as being more aggressive in his approach, and his memory lives on in the protests and rioting that have taken place throughout the years. My uncle, who was raised in a household with a successful aunt and uncle, admired Malcolm X and did not have time for Christian ministers.

01:25:00

01:40:00
In the course of teaching a college course on physics, a professor says that there are fewer black students in the physics department because they perform poorly on tests. Some black students at the university where the lecture was scheduled protest, calling the professor a racist. The professor is then disinvited from the event. Charles Murray, a social science writer and author of "The Bell Curve," is accused of being a white supremacist because he observes racial differences in measured intellectual ability among Americans of different racial backgrounds.

01:45:00
Glenn Loury discusses the issue of crime in major U.S. cities, and how race and racism play a role in the problem. He also discusses how people can deal with conflicts in a way that does not involve calling each other racists.

01:50:00

01:55:00
The video discusses the concept of "the spiral of silence," which is a equilibrium where a large number of people hold a view but because of fear of being ostracized, they don't express it. The example given is that of a child who doesn't realize that the emperor is naked, and by speaking out, creates a circumstance where everyone knows that the emperor has no clothes. This could be an equilibrium, but could be undermined by a process of cumulative revelation.

02:00:00
In this video, sociologist Glenn Loury discusses the concept of free speech and its importance in a free society.

02:15:00
Glenn Loury discusses the dangers of research that concludes cognitive ability differences exist between races, and how this research can be used to justify disparities in social outcomes. He suggests that a more nuanced understanding of human differences is necessary in order to make sound decisions about social policy.

02:20:00
In this video, Professor Glenn Loury discusses the idea that cognitive ability is influenced by many other factors, including genetic and environmental interactions. He also discusses the idea that if research on human differences is pursued, it may lead to harmful consequences. He argues that it is inappropriate for politicians to have control over the direction of such research.

02:25:00
Glenn Loury discusses his views on race and racism in America, which have shifted over time.

02:45:00
Glenn Loury discusses the idea that affirmative action is a "substitute for the actual development" of minority groups, and how he wishes that President Barack Obama had only said that he would nominate a black woman to the U.S. Supreme Court, without specifying that she would be the first black woman ever to be nominated. He argues that pandering to a certain group instead of promoting the best candidates can have negative consequences.

02:50:00
Glenn Loury, a professor of economics at Brown University, discusses his thoughts on race, racism, identity politics, and the Supreme Court.
