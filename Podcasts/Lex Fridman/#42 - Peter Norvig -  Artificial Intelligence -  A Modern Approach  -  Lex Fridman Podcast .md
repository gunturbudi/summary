Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Peter Norvig is a director of research at Google and the co-author with Stuart Russel of the book "Artificial Intelligence and Modern Approach". The book has educated and inspired a whole generation of researchers, including myself. In this podcast, Norvig touches on the topics of utility function, optimization, and inverse reinforcement learning.

00:05:00
Peter Norvig discusses artificial intelligence and how it works, noting that there are two goals that need to be balanced - achieving fairness for all protected classes and optimizing for dopamine rush. He explains how a systematic approach was used to write his book, and how it felt to go to lunch with other AI faculty at Berkeley.

00:10:00
The video discusses the writing process for a book on artificial intelligence, which involved outlining chapters and assigning them to various authors. The book was completed over the internet in the 1990s but is now updated for the present day.

00:15:00
Peter Norvig discusses the importance of artificial intelligence (AI) having a modern approach that incorporates other technologies like deep learning. He believes that the partial demise of experts to symbolic systems in the 1980s is a good analogy for the current state of AI. Norvig also believes that understanding representation and reasoning is crucial for AI to be successful. He suggests that these concepts can be separated out and that deep learning offers a way to do this. Norvig believes that explanations are important for people to have when using AI, and that they should be a part of the trust and validation process.

00:20:00
Peter Norvig discusses the challenges of artificial intelligence and how to overcome them. He also discusses the importance of trust between humans and AI systems.

00:25:00
Peter Norvig discusses the importance of trust in AI systems and the challenges of online education. He suggests that both in-person and online education experiences need to be supplemented with a strong motivation factor in order to be successful.

00:30:00
Peter Norvig discusses the importance of having both a physical and online presence when studying computer science, as well as the various ways one can learn to code. He advises students to focus on problem solving and modeling, rather than simply knowing the syntax of a programming language.

00:35:00
In this video, Peter Norvig discusses how computer scientists can learn from other disciplines to become better problem solvers. He also discusses how Google has evolved its hiring process to be more inclusive.

00:40:00
Peter Norvig discusses the advantages of Lisp over other languages, and discusses why it has not enjoyed the same level of success. He also discusses the power of Lisp's simplicity and its ability to allow for flexible programming.

00:45:00
Peter Norvig discusses the challenges faced in the early days of Google, when the company was rapidly growing. He talks about the importance of getting the right answers, implementing them efficiently, and testing them to ensure that people are getting the most desirable results.

00:50:00
Peter Norvig discusses the importance of creating useful systems rather than human level intelligence. He notes that this is not an easy task, and that there are many different tasks that need to be accomplished before reaching that goal.

00:55:00
Peter Norvig discusses the potential benefits and dangers of artificial intelligence. He says that while AI has the potential to be used for good, it also has the potential to be used for bad. He believes that tests of intelligence are important, and recommends using natural conversation as a test.

01:00:00
Peter Norvig discusses the benefits and drawbacks of artificial intelligence, and how it can be used to improve society. He also discusses the challenges associated with the technology, and how programmers can maximize its potential.
