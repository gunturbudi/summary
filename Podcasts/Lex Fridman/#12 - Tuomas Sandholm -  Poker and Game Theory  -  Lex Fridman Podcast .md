Sandholm discusses game theory and poker, and how his research could impact both fields. He explains how he is using deep learning to overcome some of the challenges of applying game theory to real-world situations.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Tuomas Sandholm is a professor at the University of Helsinki who has published over 450 papers on game theory and machine learning. In 2017, he and his team beat a group of expert human poker players in a game of heads-up no limit Texas hold'em. This conversation is part of MIT's course on artificial general intelligence, and it discusses the game of poker, the importance of heads-up no limit Texas hold'em, and the process of trying to get statistical significance in a large sample size.

00:05:00
Tuomas Sandholm discusses poker and game theory, discussing how humans have a confidence in themselves that is difficult for artificial intelligence systems to beat. He also discusses the international betting sites' odds for his team's victory, and how his team was able to beat the human competition 18 months earlier.

00:10:00
Tuomas Sandholm discusses the role of luck in poker, and how deep learning could help reduce its effect.

00:15:00
Tuomas Sandholm discusses the use of learning methods for poker and game theory. He says that learning methods can be helpful in improving one's playing, but that they are not always necessary. He also mentions a recent paper that uses deep learning to generate different possibilities for a game, and allows the opponent to select from a set of continuation strategies.

00:20:00
Tuomas Sandholm discusses the theory of games and how to appropriately adjust one's beliefs in order to achieve Nash equilibrium. He also discusses the concept of rational play and how it applies to different types of games.

00:25:00
Tuomas Sandholm discusses how game theory can be used to help analyze different games, including poker. He explains that there are two types of games- zero-sum and general sum- and that the difference between two-player and multiplayer games is important. He also discusses the Nash equilibrium and how it can be a problem in more than one game.

00:30:00
Tuomas Sandholm discusses how game theory can be used to model human behavior, emphasizing the importance of formalizing interactions in a way that can be analyzed. He also discusses two start-up companies that are using game theory to model business and sports interactions.

00:35:00
Tuomas Sandholm discusses his experience working on poker and game theory, and how this relates to designing AI systems that can play complex games. He also discusses the annual Computer Poker Competition and how it has helped advance AI.

00:40:00
Tuomas Sandholm discusses his work on game theory and poker, discussing how his research has led to a new understanding of the game and the implications for human competition. He also discusses the impossibility of achieving certain goals using mechanism design tools.

00:45:00
Tuomas Sandholm discusses the history of mechanism design, focusing on the seminal event of world champion human player Librettist winning the heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em tournament. He discusses the next big challenge in the field of game solving, which he hopes will be a new benchmark.

00:50:00
Tuomas Sandholm discusses how game theory can be applied to various real-world problems, such as business operations and military strategy. He also points out that machine learning methods and artificial intelligence have their own challenges that need to be addressed before they can be used to solve complex problems.

00:55:00
Tuomas Sandholm discusses how game theory can be used to help ensure that values are aligned between humans and artificial intelligence systems. He also discusses the risks of nuclear war and climate change.

01:00:00
Tuomas Sandholm discusses the challenges of applying game theory to real-world situations, and his excitement for the potential impact of his research. He discusses some of the strategies he is using to overcome these challenges, including applying deep learning.

01:05:00
Tuomas Sandholm discusses poker and game theory, and how he is interested in learning more scalable techniques for integer programming. He explains a paper he wrote this summer on a new automated algorithm configuration algorithm with theoretical generalization guarantees.
