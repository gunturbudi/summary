Dimitri Korkin is a professor of bioinformatics and computational biology at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. He specializes in the study of complex diseases using computational biology systems biology and biomedical data analytics. In February, his group used the viral genome of coronavirus 19 to reconstruct the 3D structure of its major viral proteins and their interaction with human proteins, creating a structural genomics map of the virus. In this conversation, Korkin discusses the biology of the virus and how computational methods can help us understand its structure and function. He also discusses the recent coronavirus pandemic and how cryptocurrency is still in its early days of development.

00:05:00
Dmitry Korkin discusses the computational biology of coronavirus viruses, and how they are different from other viruses. He also discusses how difficult it is to create a virus, and how pandemics like smallpox are likely to continue in the near future.

00:10:00
Dmitry Korkin discusses the exponential growth of the coronavirus, which is responsible for a range of illnesses, including smallpox. He also discusses the importance of understanding the incubation period, as well as the percentage of the asymptomatic population that is still contagious. Korkin discusses the swine flu, which is a particularly deadly form of the coronavirus.

00:15:00
Dmitry Korkin discusses the potential for viruses to evolve and become more dangerous, as well as how to prevent this from happening. He also discusses some of his worries regarding current viruses, and how we are still dealing with different types of influence.

00:20:00
Dmitry Korkin discusses the computational biology of coronavirus, highlighting how viruses need to attach to host cells and how different strains have different methods of doing so.

00:25:00
Dmitry Korkin discusses how three proteins on the surface of the virus help it attach to and hijack cells. He also mentions that because of the high number of proteins present, it is difficult to know their exact function.

00:30:00
Dmitry Korkin from the University of Maryland discusses the importance of computational biology in the study of viruses. He describes how computational scientists can help to predict the function of proteins based on their similarity to proteins known from other viruses. He also notes that collaboration between biologists and computer scientists is necessary for the continued advancement of our understanding of viruses.

00:35:00
Computer scientists are increasingly becoming helpful to biologists in understanding the function of viruses and cells. However, there is still much to learn about the complex interactions between proteins and small molecules in complex genetic disorders such as cancer.

00:40:00
In this video, Dmitry Korkin discusses the challenges of computational biology, including protein folding. He explains that protein folding is a combinatorial problem, but notes that machine learning approaches are being used to try to tackle it.

00:45:00
The video discusses how computational biologists have been able to solve protein folding problems more efficiently than traditional scientists. The video also discusses how CASP, an Olympic-style competition for protein folding, is helping to advance the field.

00:50:00
This video discusses Dmitry Korkin's paper, "Structured of Tsarskoe how do you even pronounce our scurvy - Co V - yeah by The Cove it is such a terrible name but it stuck", which describes evolutionary conserved functional regions of viral proteins. Korkin and his team were able to identify conserved functional regions in various coronavirus proteins and compare them to other coronaviruses.

00:55:00
Dmitry Korkin teaches a class on computational biology of coronavirus, which has had a significant impact on local economies and the health of people in New England.

01:00:00
The Lex Fridman podcast discusses Dmitry Korkin's work on the computational biology of coronavirus proteins. Korkin uses existing information about SARS proteins and SARS genes to help identify potential proteins and protein structures. He then uses these structures and interactions to try to understand how the proteins work together, and to identify which proteins might be necessary for a virus to cause disease. This process is complicated by the fact that the proteins can interact with each other in complicated ways.

01:05:00
In this video, Dmitry Korkin discusses the computational biology of coronavirus. He explains that the interaction between multiple proteins is often necessary for the virus to carry out its function. He also notes that the accuracy of models based on previous studies is higher than models that do not use template information.

01:10:00
The 3D structural information of the new coronavirus has revealed that it is different from the SARS virus in terms of how it targets proteins and interacts with small molecules. This information will be helpful in understanding the virus and in designing drugs to treat it.

01:15:00
This video discusses the complexity of the coronavirus, focusing on its structure and its interactions with other organisms.

01:20:00
Dmitry Korkin discusses the potential for nanoparticle design to create vaccines against the coronavirus. He notes that understanding the virus' structure is key to successful vaccine design, and that the timeline for such a vaccine is currently 18 months accelerated from historically speaking.

01:25:00
The video discusses how computational biology is being used to help design future vaccines and antiviral drugs to fightcoronavirus. There is concern that it may take 10 years to develop a vaccine, and that the collaborative aspect of the scientific community is helping to speed up the process.

01:30:00
The video discusses Dmitry Korkin's research on the computational biology of coronavirus, and how it is an interesting example of evolution working well. The interviewer asks Korkin about the possibility of the virus becoming resistant to antiviral drugs, and Korkin says that this is an open question that needs to be studied.

01:35:00
Dmitry Korkin discusses the computational biology of coronavirus, highlighting how the virus depends on its host to function. The work is relevant to understanding outbreaks of coronavirus on cruise ships, as well as other large-scale epidemiological studies.

01:40:00
This video discusses how computational biology can be used to study the evolution and behavior of coronavirus infections. The video features Dmitry Korkin, a computational biologist at the University of Cambridge, discussing how his team uses agent-based simulation to study the interactions between the virus, the horse, and the host. In addition, the video discusses a paper that Korkin and his team are planning to publish in which they will describe their analysis of the virus from the movie Contagion.

01:45:00
This video discusses the computational biology of coronavirus and how scientists are using information technology to help them study the virus. It also mentions a study that found that a person who is symptomatic is already contagious, and another study that found that a person sheds viruses in a number of ways.

01:50:00
The video discusses the risks and benefits of wearing masks to prevent coronavirus infection. It also discusses the psychological effects of wearing masks.

01:55:00
Dmitry Korkin discusses the challenges of collaborating with scientists in Russia, noting that the field of computer science is not as popular there as other sciences. He talks about his collaborations with scientists in biometrics and notes that the field is very strong in Russia.

02:00:00
Dmitry Korkin discusses his frustrations with the Russian scientific community and how it has limited his ability to collaborate with other scientists. He also discusses his collection of bobbleheads and his favorite scientist.

02:05:00
Dmitry Korkin discusses the various ways that computer science and biology intersect, and how this has led to insights into the workings of viruses and genes. He also shares words from Edward Osborne Wilson, who discusses the variety of genes and viruses on Earth and how they exceed those in all of the rest of life combined.
