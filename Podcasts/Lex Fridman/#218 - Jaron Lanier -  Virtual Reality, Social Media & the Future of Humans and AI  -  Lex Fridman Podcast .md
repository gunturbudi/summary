Lanier concludes the interview by discussing his thoughts on turning software into creatures, and how hedgehogs are the perfect animal to represent this trend.

01:20:00
The paper discussed how understanding physical theories as matrix models can allow for more flexibility when moving between different ways of understanding systems. The idea is to have more options and tools because theoretical physics is hard. Jaron Lanier discusses how the project has progressed and how it is approaching old problems in a fresh way. One of the ways this is happening is by exploring how universes can be thought of as big neural networks.

01:25:00
Jaron Lanier discusses the potential of virtual reality, social media, and the future of humans and artificial intelligence. He believes that music has the ability to connect people to something greater, and that it is impossible to understand everything about it.
