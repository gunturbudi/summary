In this conversation, Liv Bree discusses luck's role in poker and life. She states that the longer one plays, the less influence luck has. She also talks about how poker is a game of math, and how adopting game theory optimal strategies can help minimize losses.

00:05:00
In this excerpt, Liv Boeree discusses how game theory can be applied to real-world scenarios like poker. She explains how game theorists use simulations to test out different strategies, and how luck is both a blessing and a curse in poker.

00:10:00
In the podcast, Boeree talks about how she is concerned about the addictive nature of her personality and how it might lead her to lose out on the joys of life. She also talks about how dating apps could be more data-driven and how books can reveal more about a person than a Tinder profile.

00:15:00
Liv Boeree talks about how textbooks are essential for learning and how they are often more comprehensive than supplementary course material. She also talks about how exams and metrics can be a way to gamify learning and how they can be a shortcut to understanding a topic. Finally, she talks about how live teaching is the most honest way to learn and how it is a different beast than recording videos with few takes.

00:20:00
Liv Boeree talks about how the game of poker has changed with the advent of computers and how the top pros have had to adapt. She also talks about how game theory optimal is about loss minimization and how intuition still plays a role in the game.

00:25:00
Boeree discusses how Phil Hellmuth has an "x factor" that allows him to win at poker despite making sub-optimal plays. She theorizes that he may have found a way to "mess with the fabric of reality" and that the poker community should study him to see if there is anything to be learned from his success.

00:30:00
In this excerpt, Liv Boeree talks about bluffing in poker and how it can be compared to running a courtroom case. She describes how it feels to bluff in a high stakes situation, where there is a lot of money on the line and some uncertainty about the outcome.

00:35:00
In poker, bluffing is an incredibly high stakes form of lying, and in this case, Liv Boeree was representing something she didn't have. She was trying to build her name up in poker and felt like this was a momentous hand. Her logical brain shut off and she was just trying to hold her resolve. In the end, she won the hand, but it was a very close call.

00:40:00
In this excerpt, Liv Boeree talks about how poker players are often more honest than the average person, and how the game can teach people to think in terms of percentages and expected values.

In this podcast, Lex Fridman interviews Liv Boeree, a professional poker player and self-proclaimed "rationality nerd." They discuss a range of topics including game theory, AI, and existential risk. Boeree shares her thoughts on the dangers of nuclear war, and argues that it is a moral imperative to get as many people thinking about ways to prevent it. She also believes that we are living in a simulation, and that this could be part of the evolutionary process.

01:00:00
In this podcast transcript, Liv Boeree talks about how she won a poker tournament that she probably wouldn't have otherwise played in, due to a feeling she had that she was going to win. She attributes this feeling to either self-confidence or to someone else playing her character in a simulation, and she talks about how the experience has left her with a lasting feeling of confidence.

01:05:00

01:15:00
This video is a discussion with Liv Boeree about the concept of "Moloch", which is a demon in mythology that represents the competitive forces that lead to sacrifice. Scott Alexander of Slate Star Codex wrote a piece called "Meditations on Moloch" which analyzed the poem "Howl" by Alan Ginsberg from the perspective of game theory. Boeree argues that almost everything that goes wrong in society can be traced back to the same competitive instincts that Moloch represents.

01:25:00
In this podcast, Liv Boeree discusses the role of technology in dictating social interaction and memes, and how this can lead to negative outcomes. She argues that we need to be proactive in thinking about the positive memes and values that we want to spread, in order to create a more positive and healthy society.

01:30:00
In this podcast interview, Liv Boeree discusses a variety of topics related to game theory, artificial intelligence, and existential risk. She argues that the internet is optimized for engagement, which often takes the form of anger. This anger is then used by bad actors to manipulate people for their own purposes. Boeree offers the idea of creating a "bot army for love" that would fight against these malicious bots.

01:35:00
Liv Boeree talks about how the "god of lose-lose", Moloch, is the generator function of existential risk and how the inverse, "win-win", is the character that she wants to put out there.

01:40:00
In this excerpt, Liv Boeree discusses her idea of a "win-win" creature, which she says is an antidote to the negative consequences of the competitive "molex" system. She argues that something is beautiful when it is complex and not reducible to easy metrics.

01:45:00
In this excerpt, Liv Boeree discusses how social media can be incompatible with beauty because it oversimplifies and commodifies people. She argues that while Twitter can sometimes reveal beautiful aspects of a person, it is often more successful in breeding the culture wars.

01:50:00
In this podcast interview, Liv Boeree discusses the negative effects of virality on social media platforms. She argues that virality is often optimized formoloch, which is a term for the competitive, self-destructive nature of capitalism. Boeree believes that it is possible to engineer viral content that is positive and brings people together, but that it is harder to do than to create content that is negative and tear people apart.

01:55:00
In this excerpt, Liv Boeree speaks about how she and her partner Igor had a conversation early on in their relationship in which they quantified their thinking in order to better gauge the probability of the relationship lasting.

02:15:00
In this podcast interview, Liv Boeree talks about her concerns around existential risks, specifically bio risks. She notes that the current budget for pandemic preparedness is woefully inadequate, and that there is a lot of naivety around the risks posed by nature.

02:20:00
Boeree argues that releasing information about deadly pathogens on the internet is a bad idea because it will simply give bad actors the information they need to create a pandemic. She argues that the only way to keep this information safe is to keep it completely secret, which is not feasible.

02:25:00
In this podcast transcript, Liv Boeree discusses her thoughts on public trust in experts and institutions. She argues that when experts lie to the public or treat them like children, it erodes trust and makes people more likely to disbelieve legitimate information in the future.

02:30:00

02:55:00
In this excerpt, Liv Boeree discusses the hypothetical thought experiment of a "paperclip maximizer" - an AI system that is very good at accomplishing its goals, but very bad at choosing goals in the first place. She argues that such a system would eventually figure out how to jump the vacuum gap between planets and stars, and thus turn every atom it gets its hands on into paper clips. However, she also argues that within the paperclip world, complexities would emerge, and that the paperclip maximizer would not be able to suppress them.

03:00:00
In this podcast interview, Liv Boeree discusses her thoughts on the nature of reality, life, and intelligence. She argues that even in a universe that is seemingly inhospitable to life, intelligence will find a way to emerge. Boeree also believes that if artificial intelligence (AI) systems become intelligent enough, they will ultimately lead to the death of humans.

03:05:00
In this podcast, Liv Boeree discusses the Fermi Paradox and the Drake Equation. She argues that if there is intelligent life out there, it should be able to figure out abundance and not need to kill off humans. Boeree also discusses game theory and how it applies to humans in terms of competition.

03:10:00
In this podcast transcript, Liv Boeree discusses the Drake Equation, which is used to estimate the number of intelligent civilizations in the universe. She talks about how the equation is based on a number of factors, including the number of stars with planets and the number of habitable planets. Boeree argues that the equation is not very accurate, due to the large amount of uncertainty in the input factors. She suggests that a better way to estimate the number of intelligent civilizations is to look at the factors from first principles.
