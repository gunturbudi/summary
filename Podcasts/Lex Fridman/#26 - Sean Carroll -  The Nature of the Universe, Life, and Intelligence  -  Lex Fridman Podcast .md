Sean Carroll discusses the nature of consciousness and intelligence, noting that we are all less conscious than we think we are and that consciousness is a social construct. He also points out that reaching "the bar" for consciousness may not involve fundamental understanding of how the brain works, and that the future may involve more agents that look and act like humans but are not actually conscious.
