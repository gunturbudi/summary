# Summary of Jim Gates: Supersymmetry, String Theory and Proving Einstein Right | Lex Fridman Podcast #60

In this video, Jim Gates discusses the theory of supersymmetry and how it could help prove Einstein right. He also discusses the theory of force carriers, and how they are essential to understanding the fundamental forces of nature. Gates explains that these theories are not only elegant, but also quite simple.
In this conversation with James Gates Jr., Gates discusses some of the most exciting problems in physics, which include quantum computing and the universe's construction. Gates stresses the importance of having respect for authority and of being unthinking in order to pursue truth.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Professor Gates discusses the theoretical physicist and professor at Brown University, James Gates Jr. He talks about the possible challenges of human beings venturing outside of our solar system and the possible breakthroughs that would be necessary.

00:05:00
Jim Gates discusses the challenges involved in sending humans to Mars, and suggests that a business entrepreneur could help make the journey cheaper and faster.

00:10:00
Jim Gates discusses the Supersymmetry theory, String Theory, and how they differ from the theories used to go to the moon. He also mentions the engine called a flare engine which has the potential to be more economical and more efficient than traditional rocket engines. Gates believes that the technological advancements we've seen so far are incremental, and do not seem to be leading to significant reductions in the cost of space travel.

00:15:00
Jim Gates argues that mathematics is the language we are capable of using to describe the universe, and that there may be other universes. He also believes that the human mind can be compressed and sent at the speed of light.

00:20:00
Jim Gates discusses how he has observed different ways in which his creativity expresses itself, one of which is through the Chinese water torture mythos. He goes on to say that unless artificial intelligence can dream, humans will not be able to fully realize consciousness.

00:25:00
Jim Gates discusses how he came to understand that one's subconscious can be harnessed for mathematical purposes, and how this understanding has helped him solve difficult problems. He explains that the experience was a dream, and that he believes that war will always exist because of the costs involved.

00:30:00
In this video, Jim Gates discusses the theory of supersymmetry and how it could help prove Einstein right. He also discusses the theory of force carriers, and how they are essential to understanding the fundamental forces of nature. Gates explains that these theories are not only elegant, but also quite simple.

00:35:00
Jim Gates discusses supersymmetry, string theory, and how it proves Einstein right. He also discusses the theory of gravitons, which has yet to be verified.

00:40:00
Jim Gates discusses the mathematics of supersymmetry and how it led him to pursue a career in physics. He describes his undergraduate degree in mathematics and how it led him to pursue a career in physics, mentioning the beauty of symmetry and how it is only when symmetries are broken that we get creatures like humans.

00:45:00
Jim Gates discusses supersymmetry, which is a mathematical idea that suggests that there are additional force carriers that behave like electrons. Gates discusses how supersymmetry can be a boundary between two buckets, one for particles with electric charge and one for particles without electric charge. He also discusses how supersymmetry has yet to be validated experimentally.

00:50:00
Jim Gates discusses supersymmetry and string theory, explaining that these theories describe the way that physical laws appear to be different from what Newton would have told us. He goes on to describe an experiment that Einstein predicted would be possible to verify his theory, and how modern physics is based on trying to solve problems that scientists don't know how to solve.

00:55:00
In this video, Jim Gates explains how error correcting codes are found in mathematical objects, and how they play a role in communication reliability.

01:00:00
Jim Gates discusses the concept of string theory, which is a set of mathematical principles that describe the behavior of tiny particles. There is currently no overarching theory that explains all of string theory's principles, but it has been extremely productive in unlocking new insights about mathematics. The theory is still in its early stages, and there are many open challenges that scientists are currently working on.

01:05:00
Jim Gates discusses supersymmetry, string theory, and Einstein's theory of relativity. He discusses how the public has come to understand these complex theories, and how his book helps to bridge the gap between the public and scientists.

01:10:00
In 1911, Albert Einstein made an incorrect prediction about the behavior of light. This led to the development of modern astronomy. In 1915, he corrected himself with a new prediction that was in agreement with nature. This story illustrates the fragility of human history and the importance of mathematics.

01:15:00
Jim Gates discusses the theory of general relativity, its critics, and the potential for string theory to lead to further observational validation. He also recalls a conversation with Richard Fineman, in which the latter mentions that Gates has read his books Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman, and What Do You Care What They Say.

01:20:00
Jim Gates served on Barack Obama's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology for seven years. He recalls the experience of being called upon to serve and recalls that it instilled in him the desire to serve others.

01:25:00
Jim Gates discusses the experience of being an advisor to President Obama, discussing how he was not intimidated or afraid to ask world-renowned experts for advice, and the importance of experimental validation.

01:30:00
In this conversation with James Gates Jr., Gates discusses some of the most exciting problems in physics, which include quantum computing and the universe's construction. Gates stresses the importance of having respect for authority and of being unthinking in order to pursue truth.
