# Summary of Steven Pinker: AI in the Age of Reason | Lex Fridman Podcast #3

In this video, Steven Pinker discusses the idea that human thought is a result of interconnected neural networks, and argues that there is something mysterious and magical about these networks. He observes that artificial neural networks have been becoming more successful in the past 10 years, but argues that this is because the human neural networks are better at understanding subjective first-person experience.

Steven Pinker discusses the idea that human thought is a result of interconnected neural networks, and argues that there is something mysterious and magical about these networks. He observes that artificial neural networks have been becoming more successful in the past 10 years, but argues that this is because the human neural networks are better at understanding subjective first-person experience.

00:05:00
Steven Pinker believes that there is a big difference between the human neural network and the ones that artificial intelligence currently uses, and that there is a chance that artificial intelligence will never be able to achieve consciousness. He also believes that the size of a neural network is not enough to create structure and knowledge, and that the natural selection of neural networks will help to create AI that is more like humans.

00:10:00
Steven Pinker argues that the threat of artificial intelligence is not as clear-cut as some might believe, and that Elon Musk's concerns about AI are misplaced. He points to the dangers of weapons development and argues that if World War II had not occurred, nuclear weapons may not have been invented.

00:15:00
Steven Pinker, a Harvard professor and author of "The Better Angels of Our Nature," discusses the dangers of artificial intelligence, which he believes are unfounded. He likens the fear of AI to the fear of technology in the past, and argues that the distinction between special-purpose AI and general AI is irrelevant.

00:20:00
Steven Pinker discusses the potential benefits of artificial intelligence, and how the current culture of safety should not be thrown out the window. He argues that the progress of AI has been impressive, but that there is no reason to think that an all-powerful system will be developed overnight.

00:25:00
Steven Pinker argues that thinking about AI killing all human civilization is a form of "fanciful magical thinking." Sam Harris agrees, and says people who enjoy thinking about such things are "intellectually thrilling." However, Pinker also points out that such thinking can be paralyzing, leading to a lack of focus on more important risks.

00:30:00
In this episode of the Lex Fridman podcast, Steven Pinker discusses the importance of reason in the age of artificial intelligence. He also talks about his favorite book, Enlightenment Now, which is influenced by David Deutsch.

00:35:00
In this video, Steven Pinker discusses the idea that humans have a wisdom that comes from understanding that problems are inevitable but solutions create new problems. He also cites books as influential in developing this wisdom, including "One Two Three Infinity" by George Gamow and "Reflections on Language" by Noam Chomsky. Finally, he mentions the book "The Selfish Gene" by Richard Dawkins, which was influential for its content as well as its writing style.
