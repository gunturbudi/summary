Michael I. Jordan discusses the future of AI and machine learning, highlighting the need for practical concepts and real-world applications. He argues that we are in a "proto field" of engineering, and that we are not quite sure how the brain works yet. He suggests that we hope for breakthroughs in understanding the brain, rather than relying on metaphors or engineering concepts that are not yet fully understood.

00:10:00
Michael Jordan discusses the history of AI, talking about how mimics the history of chemical engineering. He believes that there will be breakthroughs in machine learning that will bring value to human beings at scale, similar to the advances made in electrical engineering and chemical injury.

00:15:00
In this video, Michael I. Jordan discusses the future of artificial intelligence and shares his thoughts on the importance of multiple voices in the field. Jordan also discusses the importance of data science and the need for ai to be grounded in real-world consequences.

00:20:00
Michael I. Jordan discusses the challenges of making decisions that scale with AI systems. He discusses the importance of both prediction and decision making, and provides an example of a system that he thinks about when thinking about AI systems that make decisions.

00:25:00
This YouTube video discusses Michael I. Jordan's thoughts on the future of AI, music, and markets. Jordan believes that companies like Spotify and YouTube can help create new markets for music creators and make them comfortable living off of their work.

00:30:00
In this video, Michael I. Jordan discusses the challenges of designing interfaces for machines to interact with humans and the importance of cultural credibility when it comes to such technology. He also talks about the importance of recommender systems in the future of AI.

00:35:00
In this video, Michael I. Jordan discusses the potential of a future in which the advertising industry is replaced by a model in which creators and consumers are connected directly. He believes that Google and Facebook have slowly been moving in this direction, but that the advertising model is so successful that it may be difficult to change.

00:40:00
In this video, Michael I. Jordan discusses the future of AI and its impact on advertising. Jordan argues that while advertising will continue to be an important part of marketing, it will need to be reformulated in order to connect producer and consumer more directly. He also discusses the potential for Facebook to improve its advertising algorithm.

00:45:00
In this Lex Fridman podcast, Michael I. Jordan argues that Facebook has a creepy and abusive business model, and that other companies, such as Microsoft, have a better track record of being ethical. Jordan also discusses his optimism for Facebook's potential to create "beautiful things" using its personal data.

00:50:00
In this video, Michael I. Jordan discusses the challenges of creating a "frictionless" system for recommending items to users, and the potential benefits of such a system. He also suggests that, in the meantime, users should be open to the possibility of being recommended items they might not otherwise be interested in.

00:55:00
In this podcast, Michael I. Jordan discusses the benefits and drawbacks of artificial intelligence and its potential to improve human interactions. He also talks about the need for technology to be transparent and controlled by the individual, and the need for conversations between different technology experts to develop proper policies.

Overall, Jordan believes that AI will have a positive impact on human happiness, but that it is important for people to have control over their privacy. He also urges for more open discussions between technology experts to help develop policies that are best for the people involved.

01:00:00
Michael Jordan shares his thoughts on the future of AI and its potential to help humans become more aware and less anonymous. He believes that human beings are basically good, but that they are limited by their own ignorance. He also believes that the distributed nature of AI is key to its success.

01:05:00
Michael Jordan discusses the future of artificial intelligence, with particular focus on optimization. He describes how game theory can be used to understand how systems work, and discusses how different equilibria in game theory can be used to predict real-world behavior. He also discusses how deep learning can be used to minimize losses in a complex system.

01:10:00
Michael I. Jordan discusses the role of stochasticity in gradient descent, and how it can help optimize surfaces more efficiently.

01:15:00
Michael Jordan discusses the history of optimization, describing how it began with the use of gradient descent and has evolved over time to include more complex methods. He also discusses statistics, which are principles that allow for the analysis of data and the determination of probabilities.

01:20:00
In this video, Michael I. Jordan discusses the history of statistics, and how it relates to machine learning and recommender systems. He also explains the concepts of bayesian frequencies and risk.

01:25:00
Michael I. Jordan discusses the challenges of defining and measuring intelligence, and how humans may one day achieve benchmarks for general intelligence.

01:30:00
Michael I. Jordan, a psychologist, discusses the complexity of human intelligence and how markets are intelligent. He argues that while it is difficult to predict the future of markets, one day they could become even more intelligent than humans.

01:35:00
Michael I. Jordan discusses the future of AI, machine learning, and recommender systems, and gives advice to undergraduate students interested in these topics. He says that the door is open, and that it's a journey of apprenticeship with an advisor. Jordan discusses the importance of community and internationalism in the field of AI, and says that nationalism is at odds with the cooperative mindset of most AI researchers.

01:40:00
In this interview with Michael I. Jordan, the speaker discusses the importance of learning languages, and how it can be a valuable tool for thinking critically and empathizing with others. Jordan also calls for broadening the scope of artificial intelligence (AI), as it is still in its early stages.

01:45:00
In this video, Michael I. Jordan discusses the importance of machine learning and Recommender Systems, and how they can help create a human-centric engineering discipline. He explains that while the field is still in its early stages, there are plenty of challenges ahead, and we should be careful not to over hype the technology.
