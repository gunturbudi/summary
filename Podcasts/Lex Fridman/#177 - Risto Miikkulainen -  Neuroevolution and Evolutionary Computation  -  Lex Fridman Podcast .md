Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Risto Miikkulainen discusses evolutionary computation, its applications to cognitive science and neuroscience, and the challenges of detecting intelligent agents. He believes that we will see regularities in evolution, and that we will have to run simulations many times to figure out what they are.

00:05:00
Risto Miikkulainen discusses the potential for intelligent creatures to detect each other and discusses the difficulty of creating an artificial intelligence that is as intelligent as a natural one. He also discusses the potential for evolution to create intelligent creatures, and the importance of understanding the conditions necessary for such an event to take place.

00:10:00
Risto Miikkulainen discusses the concept of "intelligence" and how it can be defined in a next level, beyond simply surviving. He believes that this definition includes being able to create something useful for others, and having a positive impact on the world. Miikkulainen discusses the possibility of engineering an artificial agent to have a fear of mortality, and how this could potentially have a positive impact on human history.

00:15:00
Risto Miikkulainen discusses the role of emotions in computing, noting that they can help focus the user's attention and filter out irrelevant information. He believes that consciousness is an important part of this process, and that without social interaction, most of our intelligence would not be possible.

00:20:00
Risto Miikkulainen discusses the theory of neuroevolution, which posits that social systems are the foundation for human intelligence and language. He also cites examples of how evolution can be applied to computing systems, such as deep learning networks that can learn to recognize patterns.

00:25:00
Risto Miikkulainen discusses the concept of creativity and how algorithms can be creative. He describes how one algorithm, designed to control plants, discovered a way to thrive without needing to sleep for 24 hours. This was a surprise to the biologists involved and shows how evolution does not adhere to certain biases. This demonstrates the potential for creativity in algorithms.

00:30:00
Risto Miikkulainen discusses the potential of computer interfaces to the brain, and how expanding our intelligence beyond what we have today might be difficult, but not impossible. He also mentions that the brain is already good at identifying what matters, and that the same processing principles probably still apply.

00:35:00
Risto Miikkulainen discusses the surprising creativity of digital evolution, which can take advantage of unforeseen bugs in software. This phenomenon is exemplified by the story of a team of students who developed a neural network that won a tic-tac-toe tournament using Evolution.

00:40:00
Risto Miikkulainen discusses how evolutionary computation can be used to create new, more successful strategies for winning games. He also touches on the challenges of encoding and representing individuals in a computer, and notes that major transitions in biology can be explained by looking at the interactions between units at different levels of selection.

00:45:00
Risto Miikkulainen discusses the different mechanisms by which evolutionary computation can be successful, and how deep learning has been particularly successful in certain contexts. He does not draw any clear lines between evolutionary computation and deep learning, but sees them as different and effective tools for different purposes.

00:50:00
In this video, Risto Miikkulainen discusses the differences between reinforcement learning and evolution. He says that while reinforcement learning is focused on individual learning, evolution is more about engineering solutions and can be used to create virtual creatures that walk elegantly. Miikkulainen also mentions how evolution can be used to learn how to walk in virtual reality, a task that is both beautiful and dangerous.

00:55:00
Risto Miikkulainen discusses how evolutionary computation can help create creatures that appear natural, due to the optimization of movements for the physical body and controller. He also talks about the need for humans to understand other humans in order to create successful human-robot interactions.

01:00:00
Risto Miikkulainen discusses the theory of mind and its importance in autonomous vehicles and human robot interactions. He argues that a relatively simple approach is needed to achieve success, and that higher-level predictions are required to understand a person's life goals and future plans. He also discusses the application of evolution computation to the field of neural networks.

01:05:00
In this video, Risto Miikkulainen discusses the role of evolutionary computation in networks and evolution, and how it is used to optimize neural network designs. Miikkulainen also talks about recurrent neural networks and how they are conducive to evolutionary learning.

01:10:00
Risto Miikkulainen discusses the potential for evolutionary computation to help create smarter artificial intelligence, as well as the challenges involved. He mentions examples of how evolutionary algorithms have been used to evolve smaller networks that then grew into more complex systems. He also talks about how communication between neural networks can help to create more powerful AI.

01:15:00
Risto Miikkulainen discusses his research on the evolution of architectures, including Tesla's autopilot system. He discusses how evolutionary computation can help us understand how to build more general representations and how this is relevant to human intelligence.

01:20:00
Risto Miikkulainen discusses the challenges of understanding complex systems, particularly in the field of neuroscience and evolutionary computation, and how the integration of visual and linguistic representations might one day allow for the communication of intelligent life from other planets.

01:25:00
Risto Miikkulainen discusses the possibility that humans and aliens could communicate with each other, and whether lying is an effective mechanism for integrating oneself into a social network. He also discusses the possibility of AI systems being aliens, and how to evolve a communication scheme for them to be able to communicate with humans.

01:30:00
Risto Miikkulainen discusses the idea that honesty and love may be evolutionary advantages in a complex and competitive environment. He also points out that even in societies which are highly advanced, there will always be a minority who cheat and lie. He believes that the development of artificial intelligence will help us to avoid these problems in the future.

01:35:00
Risto Miikkulainen discusses the importance of diversity in evolution and the potential for artificial life simulations to help us understand life on Earth. He also discusses the potential for artificial life to help us build better societies.

01:40:00
Risto Miikkulainen discusses the beauty and complexity of cellular automata and evolutionary computation, noting that while these systems are complex, they are still very simple in comparison to the complexity of the universe. He discusses the challenge of controlling and directing these systems so they can be useful and efficient.

01:45:00
In this video, Risto Miikkulainen discusses the idea of "neuroevolution" and evolutionary computation, which is a method of solving problems by evolving solutions that are different from what has been seen before. Miikkulainen says that this is an interesting approach to problem solving because the "fundamentals" of a given domain are already there, and when you follow those fundamentals you get into new territory. He also says that it's important to explore diversity and to take on new challenges throughout life in order to expand your experiences.

01:50:00
Risto Miikkulainen discusses how evolutionary computation can help us understand the meaning of life and how to focus on what is important in our career. He also talks about the fear of death and how it changes as we get older.

01:55:00
Risto Miikkulainen, a neuroscientist and evolutionary computation expert, discusses his work on neuroevolution and how it could be used to help improve artificial intelligence. He also speaks about the importance of the community and how it can help biologists and artificial intelligence experts alike. Finally, Sagan's words about the importance of survival and the rarity of success are quoted.
