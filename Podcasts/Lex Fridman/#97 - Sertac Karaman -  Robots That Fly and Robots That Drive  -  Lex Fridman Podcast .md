Sertac Karaman, a professor at MIT and co-founder of the autonomous vehicle company Optimist Ride, discusses the challenges of deploying autonomous vehicles at scale. He believes that flying robots are easier to deploy than autonomous cars, and that it will be easier to do once we solve the problems of large-scale deployment.

00:05:00
The speaker discusses the feasibility of flying cars and their implications for transportation. He points out that while the technology to make this a reality is available, it will require a lot of complex software and hardware to be developed and implemented safely.

00:10:00
Sertac Karaman, a robotics expert, discusses how simulation can be a key tool in training and developing safe flying robots. He believes that simulation environments could be key to getting to a point where we can simulate human behavior very closely.

00:15:00
In this video, Sertac Karaman discusses the challenges of modeling human behavior and developing autonomous vehicles. He believes that these challenges will ultimately be overcome, and that humans will have a greater role in controlling the future than is currently recognized.

00:20:00
Sertac Karaman, the founder of Optimist Ride and Town Vehicle Company, discusses the challenges and benefits of using aggressive or passive robots in society. He notes that society will have to make choices about which type of robot is more efficient or sustainable.

00:25:00
The video discusses the differences between Tesla's and Sertac Karaman's approaches to robotics, and how each company is positioning itself in the autonomous vehicle market. While Tesla is more cautious, Sertac Karaman represents a more aggressive approach with the potential for more innovation. While the two approaches have their own strengths and weaknesses, it is ultimately important for the public to be informed so that they can make informed choices about technology.

00:30:00
Sertac Karaman discusses the challenges and opportunities for autonomous vehicles, describing how market-based approaches involving humans and teleoperation could be a powerful way to achieve widespread adoption of this technology.

00:35:00
Sertac Karaman, a roboticist, discusses the potential for autonomous vehicles to become ubiquitous, and how the application of such technology in transportation-deprived areas could lead to cost savings and increased livability.

00:40:00
Sertac Karaman, founder and CEO of Optimist Ride, discusses the benefits of using robots to transport people, and how many optimist ride vehicles would be needed to cover a city like Boston or New York.

00:45:00
The video discusses the various approaches to self-driving cars, with particular focus on self-driving cars that transport humans. It is noted that it is difficult to predict when each approach will become widespread, but that all of them are likely to have an impact in the near future.

00:50:00
Sertac Karaman, a professor at the University of Central Florida, discusses the challenges of predicting the future of technology and how iterated learning is important for companies trying to stay ahead of the curve. He suggests that companies should focus on building technology that is both useful and predictable, and warns against being pessimistic about the ability to close the technology gap.

00:55:00
Sertac Karaman, a robotics professor at Carnegie Mellon University, discusses the advantages and disadvantages of different types of autonomous vehicles, including camera-based systems. He believes that camera-based vehicles will be the dominant form of autonomous vehicles in the future.

01:00:00
Sertac Karaman discusses the challenges and opportunities in developing autonomous vehicles, including light ARS and drones. He believes that the future of autonomous vehicles may involve cars with light hours and cameras, and that the race to develop these technologies is already underway.

01:05:00
Sertac Karaman, a researcher in the field of robotics, discusses the challenges that machines currently face in terms of processing power and speed. He explains that, in the future, machines will be able to process data more quickly and efficiently through the use of parallel processing.

01:10:00
Sertac Karaman, a robotics engineer at Google, discusses the challenges of designing robots that can fly and drive, and the potential for drone racing to help overcome those challenges. He also discusses the Alpha Pilot Challenge, a DARPA-sponsored project designed to develop autonomous aircraft that can competently finish a race.

01:15:00
Sertac Karaman discusses how the field of robotics has split into different areas, including perception, decision making, and human-machine interaction. He explains how the most beautiful idea he's come across in robotics is the simplicity of Bellman's equation, which tells us how difficult it is to solve a problem. He also discusses how computational efficiency is important in robotics, and how his work on creating faster machines has led to redesigning chips.

01:20:00
In this video, Sertac Karaman discusses the challenges of making decisions in a complex and unpredictable world. He notes that, despite these challenges, the average case usually works out.
