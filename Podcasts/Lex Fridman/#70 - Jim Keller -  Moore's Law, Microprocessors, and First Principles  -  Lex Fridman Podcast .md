# Summary of Jim Keller: Moore's Law, Microprocessors, and First Principles | Lex Fridman Podcast #70

Jim Keller discusses Moore's Law, microprocessors, and first principles with Lex Fridman. He argues that the trend of increasing transistor density will continue for the next 10 to 20 years, and that designers need to be ready for the increase in complexity. He also discusses the importance of deep understanding and collaboration in order to make continuous progress.
Jim Keller discusses Moore's Law and the exponential growth of technology. He believes that Moore's Law will continue indefinitely, and that the trend of equipment cost being zero is only the beginning.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Jim Keller is a legendary microprocessor engineer who has worked at AMD, Apple, Tesla, and now Intel. He is known for his work on AMD's K7, K8, K12, and Xen microarchitectures, Apple's A4 and A5 processors, and co-authoring the specification for the x86 64 instruction set and hyper transport interconnect. He is a brilliant first principles engineer and out-of-the-box thinker. This podcast is about his conversations with Alex Friedman about the differences and similarities between the human brain and a computer, with a focus on the microprocessors core.

Jim Keller discusses Moore's Law, microprocessors, and first principles. He says that while there are many levels of abstraction in an organization, the most important layer is the instruction set, which is relatively stable. He also discusses GPUs and found parallelism, which is simpler than serial narratives but can still be sequential.

Jim Keller discusses Moore's law, microprocessors, and first principles with Lex Fridman. Keller explains that parallelism of versus turns out large, and that once you crack the problem, you can describe the dependencies between instructions in a graph. The found parallelism in a program's narrative and predictability of the narrative are both important factors in modern computer design. 20 years ago, computer prediction accuracy was 85%. Today, with deep neural networks and supercomputers, prediction accuracy is 92%.

00:15:00
Jim Keller discusses Moore's Law and microprocessors, discussing how the design and execution of code can result in different outcomes. Keller describes the Robert Frost poem "The Road Not Taken" and how it can be applied to computer design.

00:20:00
Jim Keller discusses Moore's Law, microprocessors, and first principles with Lex Fridman. Keller explains how a deep understanding of a problem can lead to better solutions, and how this is a key ingredient for success in any field. He also discusses the importance of balancing deep understanding with practical application, and how team collaboration is essential for success.

00:25:00
Jim Keller discusses Moore's Law, microprocessors, and first principles. He argues that every five years, computer architects should do one from scratch in order to improve the overall design. This also applies to instruction sets, which are updated every few years. Keller stresses the importance of leadership and communication in order to make continuous progress.

00:30:00
Moore's law, first stated in 1965, posits that the number of transistors on integrated circuits will double every two years. This has held true for over 50 years, but there are diminishing returns to this trend, with each successive increase in transistor count having a smaller and smaller impact on overall performance.

00:35:00
Jim Keller discusses Moore's Law, microprocessors, and first principles with Lex Fridman. Keller believes that the next 10 to 20 years of shrinking will happen now, and that designers need to be ready for the increase in transistors. He also speaks about the challenges of designing for increased performance, and how teams must divide and conquer in order to meet the demands of larger and more complex designs.

00:40:00
Jim Keller discusses Moore's Law, microprocessors, and first principles with Lex Fridman. Keller argues that all of these are still searches, and that optimization is a search for the best neural networks to detect cat ears.

00:45:00
Jim Keller discusses Moore's Law, the relationship between computational intensity and ability to hit mathematical abstractions, and the importance of continuing to shrink transistors in order to keep Moore's Law alive.

00:50:00
Jim Keller discusses Moore's Law, microprocessors, and first principles with Lex Fridman. Keller says that shrinking sizes and abilities of microprocessors is incredible, and speaks on the unpredictability of the future with technology advancing so fast. Keller's parents were probably the last people to have a telephone with a dial, and Keller shares how his wife and kids use technology differently. Keller discusses the inherent complexity in our world, and how computation can be said to be pedestrian when compared to mathematics. Recently, mathematics has been advancing in new and unexpected ways, and Keller wonders if this is a sign that the world is heading in a better direction.

00:55:00
Jim Keller discusses Moore's Law, microprocessors, and first principles with Lex Fridman. He explains that machines are getting faster and faster, and that humans are doing more and more computation. He believes that it is possible for machines to become conscious, and that consciousness may be an emergent phenomenon.

01:00:00
Jim Keller discusses Moore's Law, the exponential growth of technology, and the future of computing. He believes that Moore's Law will continue indefinitely, and that the trend of equipment cost being zero is only the beginning.

01:05:00
Jim Keller discusses the differences between autopilot and human driving, and how computers are getting better at the former. He also argues that, while vehicle autonomy is not a difficult problem, humans still rely on their mental models to drive safely.

01:10:00
Jim Keller discusses Moore's Law, microprocessors, and first principles with Lex Fridman. Keller points out that progress in the short term disappoints, but that in the long run, machines will be much better at certain tasks than humans. He also discusses the pressure on automotive engineers to achieve safety levels comparable to those of human drivers.

01:15:00
Jim Keller discusses Moore's Law, microprocessors, and first principles with Lex Fridman. Keller stresses the importance of craftsmen's work in engineering, and explains that making computers affordable is one of the goals of his company, Loans. He also discusses the difficulty of designing machines that can drive cars safely.

01:20:00
Jim Keller discusses how he has learned to think more clearly and apply first principles in his work as a carpenter and Tesla engineer. He also discusses how he has developed a deep understanding of what first principles are and how to apply them.

01:25:00
Jim Keller discusses Moore's Law, microprocessors, and first principles with Lex Fridman. Keller notes that while the fundamentals of the problem are still solvable, adding human beings into the picture complicates the equation. He does not share the worry of existential threats from artificial intelligence.

01:30:00
Jim Keller discusses Moore's Law and microprocessors, and gives advice on pursuing meaningful endeavors and living a fulfilling life. He also notes that while everything may seem the same at first, the universe has a mysterious way of revealing itself in new and unexpected ways.
