# Summary of Noam Chomsky: Language, Cognition, and Deep Learning | Lex Fridman Podcast #53

Noam Chomsky discusses the structure of human language and how it is similar to the internal structure of a laptop. He also discusses the deep connection between language and reason. Chomsky then discusses the limits of neural network-based machine learning, highlighting that while it can be useful, it has no bearing on human language.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Noam Chomsky discusses the possibility of communication with alien species, noting that one argument is that we could because of our cognitive abilities.

00:05:00
In this video, Noam Chomsky discusses the structure of human language and how it is similar to the internal structure of a laptop. He also discusses the deep connection between language and reason.

00:10:00
Noam Chomsky discusses the limits of human cognition, citing the example of Newton's discovery that there are no machines. He argues that this demonstrates the scope and limits of human intelligence.

00:15:00
Noam Chomsky discusses how humans impose a conception of the world in terms of perfect geometric objects, noting that this is something that has been known for thousands of years. He goes on to say that while nothing that goes beyond our native cognitive capacities is fundamentally new, adding a machine into the picture could expand our cognitive capacity in a certain sense.

00:20:00
Noam Chomsky discusses the limits of neural network-based machine learning, highlighting that while it can be useful, it has no bearing on human language. He goes on to say that, from the very beginning, deep learning is completely disconnected from science, focusing only on the task of producing grammatical sentences.

00:25:00
Noam Chomsky discusses the cognitive limitations of deep learning and its applicability to language. He points out that while neural networks may be approximators of complex structures, they are not successful in understanding the science behind language.

00:30:00
Noam Chomsky discusses the importance of language and cognitive science in his career, and how discoveries in these fields are often obvious to him. He also recalls being worried about the universe disappearing if his consciousness disappeared at age 12. He eventually stopped worrying about it because it's something that each individual has to determine for themselves.
