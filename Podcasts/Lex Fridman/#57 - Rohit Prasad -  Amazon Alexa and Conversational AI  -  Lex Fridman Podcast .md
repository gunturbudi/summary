In this conversation with Rohit Prasad, the Vice President and Head Scientist of Amazon Alexa, he discusses the challenges and impact of Amazon Alexa and conversational AI. He notes that while Alexa and similar voice assistants are the voices of artificial intelligence to millions of people, they are also an introduction to AI for people who have only encountered it in science fiction. Prasad discusses the work that the Alexa team is doing, which is an inspiration to him and others in the AI community. He also discusses the new recruiting feature of zip recruiter, which he uses to find new employees for his education tech company.

Rohit Prasad discusses the different aspects of human intelligence, and how Alexa and other conversational AI assistants are getting closer to possessing it. He also discusses the importance of natural language conversation, and how the Turing test can be used to measure it.

00:10:00
The Alexus Prize is a competition for universities to build social bots that can converse coherently and engagingly for 20 minutes. Failure means not reaching the 20 minute mark.

00:15:00
The author of the video discusses the progress made in the DARPA challenge to create a conversation with a social bot that is engaging and coherent. The author says that while the challenge is harder than it seems, it is getting closer to being completed.

00:20:00
Rohit Prasad discusses how the Amazon Alexa platform can be used for conversational AI and how universities can help contribute to the development of this technology. He also discusses the importance of customer engagement and how the company tracks user feedback to improve the accuracy of the system.

00:25:00
The speaker discusses how Amazon's Alexa AI can be improved by adding more senses, such as eyes. They also mention how social robots should learn more efficiently, using less data, and using supervised and unsupervised learning methods.

00:30:00
In this video, Rohit Prasad discusses the future of Amazon's Alexa platform and the challenges of recognizing and interacting with the AI. He believes that the physical embodiment of the AI doesn't matter as much as the AI's capabilities and its potential to delight customers.

00:35:00
In this video, Rohit Prasad discusses the various factors that go into creating a successful Alexa personality. He emphasizes the importance of giving customers control over how their Alexa sounds, looks, and behaves. Prasad also mentions the possibility of Alexa having a metaphysical presence in the human universe.

00:40:00
Rohit Prasad discusses the challenges of creating trust in AI systems, and how it is a challenge for both researchers and customers. He also discusses how privacy is a major concern for many people.

00:45:00
Rohit Prasad discusses the benefits of transparency and control when it comes to Conversational AI, as well as how Amazon Alexa listens for only the wake word on devices. He also discusses the potential for anxiety when Conversational AI is used improperly.

00:50:00
The video discusses how personalization and personality can be found in Alexa, as well as how these features can be used to improve the user experience. The author mentions that the inspiration for Alexa came from the Star Trek computer, and that everything is possible when starting with a vision statement.

00:55:00
In 2013, Rohit Prasad joined Amazon's product development team to work on deep learning for speech recognition. The team soon realized that they needed to scale deep learning to deal with the large amounts of data that would be generated by a successful Alexa product. To do this, the team used distributed GPUs to train the deep learning models quickly.

01:00:00
Rohit Prasad discusses the progress Amazon Alexa and conversational AI has made in the past, summarizing the main breakthroughs and how the team worked to bring Echo to the masses.

01:05:00
In this video, Rohit Prasad discusses how Amazon Alexa and conversational AI can be used to improve customer experience and accuracy. He notes that the first step in this process was getting a lot of training data in a far field setting. This was difficult, as there was no customer base to collect this data from. However, once they had this data, the next step was to train a natural language understanding system to reach the "magical bar." This was difficult, as it required understanding multiple domains at once. However, with the help of a large dataset, they were able to achieve success. The next step was to build an intent classifier to understand what customers wanted. This was even more difficult, as the confusion space had grown massively since the system had been developed. However, with data-driven understanding, they were able to overcome these challenges.

01:10:00
Rohit Prasad discusses Amazon Alexa's early days and how it lacked knowledge of certain topics, such as the Rolling Stones or Stone Temple Pilots. He goes on to explain that this lack of knowledge can be resolved with the help of other signals, such as conversational AI. Finally, he discusses the benefits of Alexa conversations, such as the decreased need for code and the increased utility for customers.

01:15:00
Rohit Prasad explains how Amazon's Alexa can be used to help customers with simple tasks such as buying movie tickets or finding a restaurant. He also mentions that the AI is becoming more self-learning, so it can automatically correct common errors.

01:20:00
Rohit Prasad discusses Amazon's Alexa and conversational AI, explaining how the technology corrects millions of car trances in the US without any human supervision. He also discusses how Alexa's naturalness and ability to understand requests are important factors in its success.

01:25:00
Rohit Prasad discusses the challenges of building conversational AI, highlighting the need for quality skills and a well-integrated infrastructure. He also discusses the potential for Alexa to detect frustration and improve its understanding of what the customer is trying to do.

01:30:00
Rohit Prasad, a senior engineer at Amazon, discusses the challenges that deep learning and transfer learning face when it comes to modeling the goals of people in conversation with Alexa. He argues that reasoning is one of the hardest problems to solve, and that there is still much that can be done with prediction-based approaches.

01:35:00
Rohit Prasad discusses how Amazon Alexa is evolving to be more goal-oriented and conversational, and how this will open up more opportunities for customers. He predicts that within the next five years, we will see a shift away from open domain conversations toward goal-oriented dialogues.

01:40:00
In this video, Rohit Prasad discusses the progress and challenges of conversational AI. He predicts that autonomous vehicles will be the most transformative robots of the 21st century, but says that conversational AI will have a much greater impact on people's lives in the near future. He also discusses his excitement about the potential impact of conversational AI on the research community and the general public.

01:45:00
Rohit Prasad and Lex Fridman discuss Amazon Alexa and conversational AI, with Alan Turing providing wisdom on the importance of imagination.
