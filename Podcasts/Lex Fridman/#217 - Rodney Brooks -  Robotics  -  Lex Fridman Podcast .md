00:10:00
Rodney Brooks argues that computation is a process humans can follow easily, and that it is modeled after human intelligence. This theory is based on intuition and has been successfully implemented in silicon.

00:15:00
In this video, Rodney Brooks discusses the history of four disciplines which all came into form in the mid-20th century - neuroscience, artificial life, abiogenesis, and functional neuroscience. Each field had its pioneers, but it was John von Neumann who first applied the concepts of computation to these disciplines. Brooks also discusses how people use metaphors to think about complex concepts, and how this can help us understand the universe.

00:20:00
Rodney Brooks discusses the nature of computation, its relationship to consciousness, and the potential for further human development.

00:25:00
Rodney Brooks discusses the concept of perception being difficult, and how deep learning has helped to improve our understanding of the world. He shares an anecdote about a conversation he had with a fellow computer scientist about the intuition that intelligence is only possessed by beings that are skilled in difficult areas such as chess or mathematics.

00:30:00
Rodney Brooks discusses the different aspects of robots that are difficult to create, such as perception and movement. He also discusses how a grandfather's blinding moments can teach children about how to interact with machines.

00:35:00
Rodney Brooks discusses how robotics and reinforcement learning are related and how humans rely on intuition to help them solve problems. He also shares a story about his grandson and how he used reinforcement learning to learn how to open various locks.

00:40:00
Rodney Brooks discusses the surprising level of success that neural networks have achieved in recent years, particularly in computer vision. He describes how these networks can learn and improve their performance over time.

00:45:00
Rodney Brooks discusses the beauty of ideas, including those of Amazon.com's Jeff Bezos and SpaceX's Elon Musk, and how they are able to realize their promise. He also mentions Arthur Samuel, who was the first person to use machine learning to beat world champion at checkers. Brooks believes that the human mind is capable of amazing feats, but that it is much harder to solve problems in the physical world than in the game of chess.

00:50:00
Rodney Brooks discusses the surprising aspects of some artificial intelligence (AI) projects, such as Alpha Fold.

00:55:00
Rodney Brooks, one of the greatest roboticists in history, has some negative thoughts about Tesla's autopilot. He thinks it may be on par with humans currently, but that it is a replay of the same movie.

01:00:00
Rodney Brooks discusses how his experience working on self-driving cars has led him to rethink the limits of computer vision. He mentions that the number of motor vehicle accidents is high, and points out that self-driving cars will not be able to completely eliminate accidents, but could make them much less frequent.

01:05:00
Rodney Brooks discusses the challenges of transitioning to fully autonomous vehicles, noting that it will require large adoption in order to avoid mass casualties. He also discusses the potential for self-driving trains to operate autonomously in the US, noting that this is already happening in Japan.

01:10:00
Rodney Brooks discusses how he believes that the acceptance of autonomous vehicles will not be as widespread as humans driving, due to the difficulty in creating a driverless infrastructure. He also mentions that Waymo has no driver currently and is expanding to Austin, Texas.

01:15:00
Rodney Brooks discusses the history of autonomous vehicles and how people can make extrapolations from one demonstration to the next without understanding the full scope of the technology. He argues that people have to believe in the possibility of achieving the "impossible" in order to achieve progress.

01:20:00
Rodney Brooks discusses the difference between hyperloop and other forms of technology and how it is still very much in development. He also has criticism for journalists for getting too caught up in the hype and not focusing on the actual usefulness of the technology.

01:25:00
Rodney Brooks discusses how ambitious deadlines can drive people to do their best work, even when the odds of those deadlines are very slim. He also discusses his predictions for autonomous vehicles, flying cars, and the deployment of taxi services.

01:30:00
Rodney Brooks discusses the current state of autonomous vehicles and the challenges that remain. He believes that autonomous vehicles will be available in San Francisco within 10 years, but that the technology will initially be limited to certain areas.

01:35:00
Rodney Brooks founded the robotics company IRObot and is proud of their accomplishments, including the development of the Roomba, a vacuum cleaner that is deployed in tens of millions of homes.

01:40:00
In this video, Rodney Brooks discusses his experience as the founder of two robotics companies that failed before eventually success. He explains that it is difficult to successfully run a robotics company, and that expectations of customers and founders can often be unrealistic.

01:45:00
Rodney Brooks founded rethink robotics in 2008 with the goal of making robots safe and user-friendly for factory workers. The company has since developed plastic robotic arms, which have been adopted by companies such as Google and Amazon.

01:50:00
Rodney Brooks provides an insight into the difficulties of designing and manufacturing robots cheaply, with torque ripple causing problems. Eventually, two buyers were found, but the acquisition process was difficult due to concerns over foreign investment.

01:55:00
Rodney Brooks discusses the Baxter robot, its unique screen with a face, and its potential to connect with humans on a personal level. He also talks about the challenges of creating a human form that can interact and perceive the world, and how Blade Runner was not realistic in its depiction of artificial intelligence.

02:00:00
Rodney Brooks discusses the challenges of building A.I. systems that are able to convincingly interact with humans, and why the Turing test is not a good indicator of intelligence.

02:05:00
Rodney Brooks discusses his time at MIT and the role AI played in the early days of computer science. He reflects on the disappointment of not being able to ask some of the legends the questions he wanted to, and talks about the importance of openness in the university setting.

02:10:00
Rodney Brooks discusses the importance of dreams and how they can lead to great progress in fields such as machine learning and AI. He also recalls a funny story of him and famed mathematician and computer scientist, Don Knuth.

02:15:00
Rodney Brooks discusses his experience with mortality and how it has influenced his work. He advises young people to not get too caught up in the expectations of others, and to be prepared to fail.

02:20:00
Rodney Brooks discusses his legacy and what he hopes it will be. He also discusses the meaning of life and how he thinks it is mostly random. He also discusses the three laws of robotics from Isaac Asimov.
