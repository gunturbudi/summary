Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Evolutionary psychologist David Buss discusses the importance of sex and violence in human history. He says that mating strategies and military strategies are both important, but that sex is more important because humans are sexually reproducing.

00:05:00
David Buss discusses the importance of sex, dating, relationships, and sex differences in human societies. He also discusses how fire and cooking may have contributed to the development of human beings.

00:10:00
David Buss discusses the various meanings of the word "love," explaining that while all forms of love are present in all cultures, romantic love is the most commonly recognized and understood form. He goes on to discuss the different phases of love, explaining that while infatuation is often characterized by obsessive thoughts and ideologization, the "bunnies phase" is more about intense sexuality and the development of attachment. After discussing the "face of the relationship" and how it can change over time, he concludes the talk by discussing the different forms of love and how they can be experienced.

00:15:00
David Buss discusses how humans use language to compete for mates, focusing on the way in which women derogate their rivals. He also mentions how women are very observant of the subtle imperfections in other women's appearances, something that surprises him.

00:20:00
David Buss discusses the evolutionary importance of differences between men and women, and how these differences are socially constructed. He also discusses the idea that physical appearance provides information about a person's health and fertility.

00:25:00
According to David Buss, in the mating strategies of men, small waist-to-hip ratios are one of the factors that are considered when looking for a mate. Additionally, standards of attractiveness, including being thin and having a small waist-to-hip ratio, may be biologically-evolved. In terms of human sexuality, David Buss believes that sex throughout the ovulatory cycle is a distinguishing feature of humans, relative to chimpanzees.

00:30:00
David Buss discusses the different characteristics that men and women look for in a mate, with physical attractiveness being the most important for men, and health and fertility being the most important for women. He discusses how these priorities may differ depending on a person's evolutionary history.

00:35:00
David Buss discusses sex differences in short-term mating behavior and the mate-switching hypothesis, which suggests that women are attracted to high-quality mates who are available elsewhere. His esteemed colleagues support the good-genes hypothesis, but recent evidence seems to support the mate-switching hypothesis more. This theory has implications for our understanding of human mating behavior and monogamy.

00:40:00
In this video, evolutionary psychologist David Buss discusses the cues that women look for in a mate. He notes that the most important cue for men is physical appearance, with muscle being the most important muscle group to work on. Women, on the other hand, prefer men who are physically fit but not muscle bound. Buss also discusses the role of wealth in determining a man's status in traditional cultures, and how it has changed over time. He concludes the video by discussing how modern culture has brought about changes in how men can accumulate resources, which can override the evolutionary desires of women.

01:55:00
The video discusses the various ways in which humans can mate, including pair bonding, serial mating, and polyamory. It argues that humans have a variety of mating strategies, which depend on a variety of factors.

Jealousy is discussed as a factor in polyamory, and it is argued that it needs to be dealt with.

02:00:00
The video discusses sex differences in how people react to emotional cheating and sexual infidelity. Men are more likely to react negatively to sexual infidelity, while women are more likely to react negatively to emotional cheating. This difference is seen in both scientific studies and in real-life interactions. In order to be well-balanced, individuals must have both capacities within use.
