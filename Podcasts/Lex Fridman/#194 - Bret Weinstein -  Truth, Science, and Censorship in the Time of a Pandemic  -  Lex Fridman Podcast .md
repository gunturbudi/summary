Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Brett Weinstein, evolutionary biologist, discusses the beauty and power of science, and how it is susceptible to flaws of human nature. He describes how, in 2020, the story of science will be of triumph and tragedy, and how leaders need to communicate honestly and transparently about the uncertainties of what is known. He mentions five areas where leaders should be asking and answering publically, three of which he believes should never have been silenced. He urges listeners to have hope for science and for humanity, and to support open data, open science, and open communication.

00:05:00
Bret Weinstein discusses how the flexibility of humans is accounted for by their ability to bootstrap a new software program and drive it into the unconscious layer. He predicts that the exact thing that exists in robotics - consciousness being an observer - will also exist in artificial general intelligence.

00:10:00
Bret Weinstein discusses how the timing and intricacy of one's subconscious mind can be seen in dance and movement, and how this applies to the development of artificial intelligence. He also points out how the conscious mind can become a spectator in some activities, such as tennis, and how this can be used to one's advantage.

00:15:00
Bret Weinstein discusses how the conscious mind can be "lost in conversation" and how trust is important for effective communication.

00:20:00
Bret Weinstein, a computer scientist and podcaster, discusses the idea that dwelling on past mistakes can be counterproductive and lead to negative consequences.

00:25:00
In the video, Bret Weinstein discusses how close he came to death and how luck played a role in avoiding disaster. He argues that a wise civilization would develop processes to prevent disasters before they happen, but he doesn't see this happening in the present. He also discusses the Deepwater Horizon blowout and the Fukushima triple meltdown, noting that both were very lucky.

00:30:00
Bret Weinstein discusses the probability of a virus originating from a lab, and how it could have been delivered or manipulated without being modified. He also discusses the possibility of an attack on China as a potential explanation.

00:35:00
Bret Weinstein discusses the various hypotheses as to how the Wuhan virus was released, including the idea that it was an intentional act by someone with malicious intent. Weinstein also discusses the lack of evidence to support any of the above hypotheses, and points out that the discovery of a human population or ancestor virus would be the most convincing evidence that the virus is natural.

00:40:00
Bret Weinstein discusses how the process of accelerated evolution can produce jaw-dropping adaptations, such as the SARS Cov2 virus, which does not appear to be the result of natural selection or serialpassaging. Weinstein believes that we should be investigating the truth of the origins of the SARS Cov2 virus in order to better protect ourselves from future pandemics.

00:45:00
Bret Weinstein discusses the importance of figuring out the origins of the pandemic Covid-19, and how it's a perfect test case for the theory of close calls. He emphasizes the need to focus on driving the pandemic extinct before it becomes permanent, and warns that if we don't do it soon, we will be stuck with the cost of the pandemic for years to come.

00:50:00
In this video, Bret Weinstein discusses the complex and dangerous relationship between corporations, governments, and the scientific community during a pandemic. He points out that, during a pandemic, companies may want to promote their products over their competitors' products, and government officials may want to keep information about the pandemic secret. Weinstein argues that, in order to avoid similar mistakes in the future, we need to learn from our past mistakes and take collective responsibility for our actions.

00:55:00
Bret Weinstein discusses the dishonesty and possible destructiveness of lying to protect scientists in the face of a pandemic.

01:00:00
Bret Weinstein discusses how pressure from the public and academic institutions has caused many world-class biologists to self-censor and not use their brainpower to come up with solutions outside of the conformist line of thinking.

01:05:00
Bret Weinstein discusses the history of ivermectin and its effectiveness in treating parasitic infections. He also talks about the recent controversy around the drug's use in treating people with Covid-19.

01:10:00
The meta-analysis reveals that Ivermectin is highly effective at treating people with SARS, and that it is also safe. However, there is one concern â€“ the dosage required to be effective may be too high for some people.

01:15:00
Bret Weinstein discusses the use of ivermectin and why it has been effective in preventing SARS. He also discusses the dangers of censoring science and the way that autopilot thinking can lead to harmful consequences. Weinstein talks about how YouTube has been censoring him and his channel because they disagree with him on past disagreements.

01:20:00
In this video, Bret Weinstein discusses the power of social media platforms, and how they should be used in times of a pandemic. He also discusses the importance of the First Amendment, and how social media should not be used to limit speech.

01:25:00
Bret Weinstein discusses the idea that freedom of speech can be both destructive and useful, and argues that there is a line where personal attacks become counterproductive.

01:30:00
This video discusses the issue of censorship on YouTube, and points out that, because of this censorship, it is difficult for people to be informed about potential dangers associated with certain topics. It also discusses the idea of having a system in which different views are presented to the user, rather than being "balanced" in an artificial way. This system would be based on user input, and would allow for more exploration of topics.

01:35:00
Bret Weinstein discusses the issue of censorship in the face of a pandemic, noting that it is unthinkable for YouTube to give people information on hazards of vaccines when this is a question which is still unsettled. He speculates that the solution may be for scientists to step up and become better communicators.

01:40:00
Bret Weinstein discusses the need for more open communication between scientists and the public, and the dangers of an algorithm that only shows people what they want to see. He suggests using analytics to allow people to see different perspectives and reward those who demonstrate a track record of openness and correctness.

01:45:00
YouTube personality Bret Weinstein discusses how social media can be used to build a happier, more open-minded individual. He argues that the current system is a "terrible business model" due to the short-term rewards it offers. Weinstein suggests a new system in which social media is a great business model, which would create long-term happiness and growth.

01:50:00
Bret Weinstein discusses the pros and cons of vaccines in the context of the pandemic. He points out that while the vaccines have benefits, they also have potential side effects. He also discusses the dangers of antibody-dependent enhancement, a phenomenon seen in some diseases.

01:55:00
The video discusses how there is potential for harm from coronavirus vaccines, and that it is too early to say if this will happen in the US. Bret Weinstein also argues that vaccinating everyone would be a mistake, as it would create a herd immunity that would drive the virus to extinction.

02:00:00
Bret Weinstein discusses how the data used to make decisions about vaccines is often flawed, and how this has led to many people not being vaccinated. He also discusses how society is putting children in danger by vaccinating them to protect old infirm people.

02:05:00
The paper, "The Reserved Capacity Hypothesis," hypothesizes that the aging process, which leads to senescence, is an unavoidable downside of a cancer prevention feature of our bodies. The conclusion of the paper suggests that, due to this evolutionary advantage, the genes responsible for this tendency should be maintained.

02:10:00
The paper's abstract discusses how captive rodent breeding protocols designed to increase reproductive output simultaneously exert strong selection against reproductive senescence and virtually eliminate selection that would otherwise favor tumor suppression. This appears to have greatly elongated the telomeres of laboratory mice with their telomeric Fail-Safe effectively disabled, which are unreliable models of normal senescence and tumor formation. The conclusion of the paper is that the length of telomeres is an important variable to consider when studying the safety of cancer or senescence.

02:15:00
The video discusses the controversy around a paper on mice with unusually long telomeres. The researcher, Carol Grider, tells Bret Weinstein that she was going to publish the result but changed her mind after being contacted by the pharmaceutical industry. Bret Weinstein, a graduate student at the time, says that he was interested in the evolutionary dynamics around senescence and didn't pursue grants or anything like that; he just wanted to work on a puzzle. Carol Grider, a leading light in the field of telomeric studies, tells Bret Weinstein that she wasn't planning to publish and he learns she is in the process of publishing a paper without mentioning his name. Bret Weinstein believes that the scientific community broadly screwed him over.

02:20:00
Bret Weinstein discusses the experience of seeing his work on telomeres presented without credit at a Nobel lecture, feeling "thrilled" and "terrible" due to the subsequent erasure from the story. Weinstein suggests that the problem may be that he is no longer a part of the "idea generation," and that he is careful to proceed cautiously because of this.

02:25:00
Bret Weinstein, a telomere researcher, tells his story of how his mentor, a senior researcher, suddenly cut ties with him, accusing him of plagiarism. Weinstein notes that he would have been better off pursuing his own research rather than publishing papers on subjects that his mentor was already working on.

02:30:00
Bret Weinstein discusses the challenges of synthesizing complex ideas in an open and transparent manner. He suggests that this can be done without relying on peer review, which can become "a drug in itself" of popularity. Weinstein points to the example of Neil deGrasse Tyson, who blends science communication with technical content, as an example of someone who succeeds in this way.

02:35:00
Bret Weinstein discusses his view on the drug of martyrdom and why he has no interest in it. He also discusses his love for fighting and the power of optimism.

02:40:00
Bret Weinstein discusses how Eric, his older brother, has helped him grow as a person and how his birth order may have played a role.

02:45:00
Bret Weinstein discusses the tension between fundamental and emergent research, and how he has seenEric progress over the years. Bret believes that Eric is ultimately successful, but has had disagreements with him on various topics.

02:50:00
In this video, Bret Weinstein discusses how he believes that there is a ratio of collusion to emergent processes in the case of the Covid-19 pandemic. Weinstein also talks about his book, Hunter Gatherer's Guide to the 21st Century, and how he believes that the book is a guide for the future using our past as a foundation.

02:55:00
Bret Weinstein discusses how monogamy is favored by selection in times of expansion, and how polygyny can break down into genocide if not avoided. He argues that in some cases monogamy may not be the optimal lifestyle, and that love can be found in multiple partners.

03:00:00
In this video, Bret Weinstein discusses how love can be difficult, but is ultimately worth it. He gives advice to young people about career and life choices.

03:05:00
Bret Weinstein discusses how he believes graduate school can be a valuable opportunity to explore intersections between fields and how taking useless courses can turn out to be the best ones.

03:10:00
In this lecture, Bret Weinstein discusses the importance of taking useless courses, and gives advice on how to make the most of opportunities. He argues that being a human and having opportunity is awesome, and that being a free human is unparalleled. Weinstein suggests that we should focus on achieving sustainability, and then work to liberate as many people as possible. If this is achieved, he believes that there is no way to be wrong in pursuing it.

03:15:00
Bret Weinstein discusses the Fourth Frontier, the possibility of robots taking over the world, and how ignorance often leads to confidence in assertions about problems that science cannot solve.
