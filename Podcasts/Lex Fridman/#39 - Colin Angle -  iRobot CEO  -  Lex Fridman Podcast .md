# Summary of Colin Angle: iRobot CEO | Lex Fridman Podcast #39

In this video, Colin Angle discusses the history of iRobot, its focus on data privacy, and its vision for the future of robotics. He believes that robots will eventually be in every home, and that they have the potential to help people feel less isolated and learn more about their home surroundings.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
The CEO of iRobot, Colin Angle, discusses the company's history, its success in creating safe and successful robots, and his vision for the future of robotics.

00:05:00
The video discusses the history of Roomba, which started with robots that were used in the lab or in combat zones, and then progressed to robots that were both affordable and sufficiently effective to be purchased by consumers. The next step is for robots to be autonomous and smart enough to do their own tasks, and this is beginning to be accomplished with newer models.

00:10:00
In this video, Colin Angle discusses how iRobot is working on ways to make its robots less autonomous, so that they are more like partners in the home. This is important because if the robot doesn't understand where things are, or why they are important, it can't do its job effectively.

00:15:00
Colin Angle describes the challenges of making robotics practical and affordable for everyday use, and discusses Johnson Wax's approach of partner-finding and understanding customer needs. He believes that the potential for robotics is infinite, but that we need to be careful not to overcomplicate the technology or burden people with unnecessary tasks.

00:20:00
In this video, Colin Angle discusses the challenges of trying to build robots at a lower cost, and how 3D CAD tools are helping to make this possible. He also discusses the overlap between the problems robots and autonomous vehicles are trying to solve and the tools and sensors being used to solve them.

00:25:00
Lex Fridman interviews Colin Angle, CEO of iRobot, about the future of vision sensors in robotics and the company's efforts to protect user data. Angle believes that robots will eventually be in every home, and that visual sensors will be the primary way robots understand their environment. He discusses privacy concerns and how iRobot is addressing them.

00:30:00
Lex Fridman interviews Colin Angle, CEO of iRobot, about the company's focus on data privacy and its plans to create a "data 2.0" perspective for consumers. Angle explains that, by treating the average consumer's data as if it were their own, iRobot hopes to build trust and enable robots to do more thoughtful tasks. He also notes that, although the company has not yet achieved human level intelligence, conversations with robots can still be helpful learning experiences.

00:35:00
In this video, Colin Angle discusses the role of robots in society and their potential to help people feel less isolated and learn more about their home surroundings. He also discusses a question for which he believes Captain Picard would have the best answer: what does Data think of him?
