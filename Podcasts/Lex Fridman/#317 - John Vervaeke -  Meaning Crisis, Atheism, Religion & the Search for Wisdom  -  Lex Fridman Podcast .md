# Summary of John Vervaeke: Meaning Crisis, Atheism, Religion & the Search for Wisdom | Lex Fridman Podcast #317

In the YouTube video "John Vervaeke: Meaning Crisis, Atheism, Religion & the Search for Wisdom | Lex Fridman Podcast #317", John Vervaeke argues that the meaning crisis is the result of a combination of perennial problems and historical factors. He suggests that the search for meaning may be motivated by a fear of death, and that this fear is something we experience all the time, not just in the future. Vervaeke also discusses the importance of artificial general intelligence (AGI) in the context of cognitive science, and argues that AGI is necessary in order to create a good theory of cognition, intelligence, and consciousness.
In this episode of the Lex Fridman podcast, John Vervaeke discusses the meaning crisis that has arisen in the wake of Nietzsche's declaration that "God is dead." He argues that while religion may no longer be a viable source of meaning for many people, there are other options available that can fill this void. Specifically, he cites stoicism as an example of a philosophy that has emerged in response to a similar crisis in the past and is now seeing a resurgence in popularity.
In this interview, John Vervaeke discusses how flow states can help improve our intuitions by allowing us to better distinguish between causal and correlational patterns. He argues that our current environment does not provide enough opportunities for this kind of distinction, and that this contributes to a meaning crisis. He also talks about the meaning crisis, atheism, religion, and the search for wisdom.
In this interesting conversation, John Vervaeke and Lex Fridman discuss a range of topics including the meaning crisis, atheism, religion, and the search for wisdom.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
John Vervaeke is a psychologist and cognitive scientist who studies the meaning crisis, or the factors that make people rate their lives as more meaningful. He argues that the meaning crisis is caused by a lack of connectedness to something larger than oneself, and that this lack of connectedness can lead to depression, mental illness, and addiction.

00:05:00
John Vervaeke argues that the meaning crisis is the result of a combination of perennial problems (such as feeling alienated) and historical factors (such as the loss of traditional resources for addressing these problems). He suggests that the search for meaning may be motivated by a fear of death, and that this fear is something we experience all the time, not just in the future.

00:10:00
In the YouTube video "John Vervaeke: Meaning Crisis, Atheism, Religion & the Search for Wisdom | Lex Fridman Podcast #317", John Vervaeke argues that death is not necessarily the main motivator for human behavior, but that the meaning of death is what is important. He suggests that humans have a capacity to consider certain deaths meaningful and certain deaths meaningless, and that people are willing to sacrifice their biological existence for a death they consider meaningful.

00:15:00
In this podcast, John Vervaeke discusses his views on the meaning crisis, atheism, religion, and the search for wisdom. He talks about how he believes that mind and life go away completely when we die, and that this is actually significantly important for the kind of beings that we are. He also talks about how he thinks that the fact that we participate in distributed cognition does not give us any reason to believe that that participation grounds some kind of consciousness.

00:20:00
John Vervaeke believes that consciousness is both an innate quality and something that serves a purpose. He argues that we cannot understand consciousness without understanding both what it is and what it does.

00:25:00
In this video, John Vervaeke discusses the importance of artificial general intelligence (AGI) in the context of cognitive science. He argues that AGI is necessary in order to create a good theory of cognition, intelligence, and consciousness. He also discusses the challenges associated with AGI, specifically the need to filter out vast amounts of data in order to focus on the task at hand.

00:30:00
In this podcast, John Vervaeke discusses the meaning crisis, atheism, religion, and the search for wisdom. He defines wisdom as the coordination of multiple rationalities, and explains that it is a process of constantly jumping from one rationality to another. He also talks about how framing is a process of salience landscaping, and how it is more primordial than any beliefs we have.

00:35:00
John Vervaeke discusses how our sensory motor loops constantly evolve in order to allow us to better interact with the world around us. He explains how this process of "relevance realization" applies to both physical and abstract domains, and how it allows us to better understand and manipulate the things we encounter in our lives.

00:40:00
John Vervaeke discusses the concept of "relevance realization", which is the process of making information relevant to working memory. He explains that when this happens, it becomes possible for direct sensory motor interaction with the world. He goes on to say that wisdom is the accumulation of rationalities, and that self-deception is a form of foolishness that can be overcome with wisdom.

00:45:00
In this excerpt, John Vervaeke talks about how we can be caught up in the salience of things without considering whether or not they are actually true. He gives the example of a commercial where everything is made to look perfect and happy, even though we know that's not reality. He says that sometimes we can be caught up in these things to the point where we don't care about the truth anymore.

00:50:00
John Vervaeke critiqued Objectivism, saying that while it's true that reality exists independently of consciousness, human beings cannot directly access reality through sense perception. He also critiqued Donald Hoffman's idea that reality is an illusion, saying that it doesn't make sense to say that everything is an illusion.

00:55:00
In this podcast, John Vervaeke talks about his belief that most of our cognition is illusory and that this leads to the conclusion that evolution is also part of this illusion. He argues that this is not a new idea, and that it has been proposed before by Descartes. He then goes on to say that if most of our cognition is illusory, then it makes sense that we would also think that we have contact with reality when we don't.

01:00:00
In this podcast, John Vervaeke argues that science is the best way to find out if our existence is an illusion or not. He says that as we gain a deeper understanding of our minds and cognition, we may be able to discover how much of our reality is a construct of our own minds.

01:05:00
John Vervaeke argues that the question of the meaning of life is not a useful question because it presumes that there is a plan or something that we have to discover and enter into a relationship with. He claims that meaning is not in us or in the universe, but is a proper relationship between the subjective and the objective.

01:10:00
John Vervaeke believes that music is both inside and outside of us, and that it is this duality that makes it so meaningful. He also believes that our relevance realization is not just representing properties of the world, but actually instantiating it. Asking about the meaning of life is full of romanticism, and ultimately returns to the question of meaning in mundane things.

01:15:00
In this excerpt, John Vervaeke discusses the meaning crisis in modern times, its origin, and how it has created a wisdom famine. He argues that the search for wisdom is a process, not a destination, and that the lack of homes for ecologies of practices that fit into our scientific worldview is a major contributing factor to the crisis.

01:20:00
John Vervaeke suggests that there are different types of knowing, including propositional, procedural, and perspectival knowing. He argues that the perspectival knowing associated with religion can be beneficial, even if the propositional and procedural aspects are not.

01:25:00
In this podcast episode, John Vervaeke discusses the idea of participatory knowing, which is the idea that you and the world are co-participating in things and such that real affordances exist between you. He goes on to talk about how this kind of knowing comes with a sense of belonging at every level, and how it is the coordinated storehouse of all of your agent Arena relationships.

01:30:00
In this podcast, John Vervaeke discusses the meaning crisis that has arisen in the wake of Nietzsche's declaration that "God is dead." He argues that while religion may no longer be a viable source of meaning for many people, there are other options available that can fill this void. Specifically, he cites stoicism as an example of a philosophy that has emerged in response to a similar crisis in the past and is now seeing a resurgence in popularity.

01:35:00
John Vervaeke is a non-theist who believes that the shared presuppositions between theists and atheists are actually what needs to be rejected. He believes that the idea that the ground of being is some kind of being is a fundamental mistake.

01:40:00
John Vervaeke and Lex Fridman discuss the idea that meaning is sacred in a non-theist view. Vervaeke argues that meaning is both created and discovered, and that it does not require a partner. Fridman and Vervaeke then discuss the difference between non-theism, theism, and atheism.

01:45:00
John Vervaeke and Jordan Peterson discuss religion, atheism, and the search for wisdom. They agree that myths are stories about pertinent patterns that need to be brought into awareness, and that good Mythos does this at a non-propositional level.

01:50:00
John Vervaeke talks about the power of myths and stories to connect to the patterns of each generation. He argues that some of these stories are recursive and about religio itself. He believes that the dialogue we have with each other is one of the most powerful things about us as humans.

01:55:00
John Vervaeke is a professor who studies the concept of flow state and how it relates to distributed cognition. He argues that flow state is more important than Mythos, because it is the basis within which myths and rituals are created. He also discusses how new media like podcasts and YouTube are breaking down old boundaries between the private and the public, and how this is impacting the spread of distributed cognition.

02:00:00
John Vervaeke describes mindfulness as frame awareness that can be used to improve one's ability to see things more clearly and deeply. He explains that contemplation and meditation are two different practices, and that mindfulness includes both. He argues that an ecology of mindfulness practices is necessary in order to avoid spiritual bypassing and to cycle between different practices.

02:05:00
John Vervaeke gives practical advice on how to meditate and be mindful in order to live a fuller life. He suggests that people find a meditative practice, a contemplative practice, and a moving mindfulness practice to integrate into their lives. Vervaeke also gives a step-by-step guide on how to do a meta contemplation practice.

02:10:00
In this podcast, John Vervaeke discusses flow induction, meaning crisis, atheism, religion, and wisdom. He talks about how flow induction can help people to flow wisely, and how the state of flow can be an optimal experience.

02:15:00
John Vervaeke discusses how flow states can help improve our intuitions by allowing us to better distinguish between causal and correlational patterns. He argues that our current environment does not provide enough opportunities for this kind of distinction, and that this contributes to a meaning crisis.

02:20:00
John Vervaeke discusses the idea of flow state and how it can be used to increase a sense of meaning in life. He also talks about how flow state can be hijacked by things like video games, to the detriment of a person's ability to achieve flow state in the real world.

02:25:00
John Vervaeke discusses the meaning crisis, atheism, religion, and the search for wisdom in this Lex Fridman podcast. He talks about how social media can be linked to depression and self-destructive behavior, but says that it can also be laughed at and used to create fun in the virtual world.

02:30:00
In this clip, John Vervaeke discusses how psychedelics can help break the mind out of overfitting to data, and how this can lead to new insights. However, he stresses the importance of having a sapiential framework in place in order to properly integrate these insights.

02:35:00
John Vervaeke is a philosopher who studies the origins of ideologies, and in this clip he discusses the origins of Marxism and Nazism. He explains that both of these ideologies originated from a desire to change one's life in accordance with a higher, more real state of consciousness.

02:40:00
In this excerpt, John Vervaeke talks about how Marxism is a pseudo-religious vision that inherits one of Hegel's main flaws. He explains that when Marxism came in contact with the Soviet Union, it had a powerful hold on people because it offered them the promise of a new world and new human beings.

02:45:00
In this excerpt, John Vervaeke tries to explain why Marxism and communism failed in the 20th century. He attributes it to the Promethean spirit, which he believes leads to atrocities.

02:50:00
