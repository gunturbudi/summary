This podcast discusses the difference between state-of-the-art human beings and state-of-the-art robots. Professor Levine discusses how robot capabilities have gradually increased over the years, but there is still a large gap between the intelligence of robots and that of humans. He also mentions a video of a prototype robot called the PR One that was able to clean up a room and bring a beer to a person sitting on the couch all without human input.

00:05:00
Sergey Levine discusses the gap between humans and best robots and how it can be narrowed through machine learning. He also discusses how biology is messy and humans must be adaptable in order to optimize their evolutionary fitness.

00:10:00
Sergey Levine discusses the importance of exploration in machine learning and suggests that it is important to be open to different solutions in order to improve one's understanding of the world.

00:15:00
Sergey Levine discusses the difference between computer vision and robotics, noting that with robotics, you have to take away many of the crutches that humans rely on, and consider the integration of those subproblems. He also points out that with robotics, you have to deal with the paradox of experts and machines.

00:20:00
Sergey Levine discusses the Marwick paradox, which is the discrepancy between people's intuition and the complexity of tasks that can be done by robots. He explains that the gap is due to the complexity of the physical interaction between humans and robots, and that the hardest part of robotics is combining perception and control. Levine argues that the best way to approach the problem is to look at it as a whole.

00:25:00
Sergey Levine discusses the importance of trade-offs between perceptual errors in robotic grasping, and how this relates to human level intelligence. He also mentions how recent advances in robotic grasping have made the task easier to solve, but that there is still room for further improvement.

00:30:00
Sergey Levine discusses the difficulties of grasping objects, and how recent works in robotics have employed learning methods to address these issues. He discusses the importance of common sense reasoning in robotics, and how studying robotics can help us understand how to put common sense into our AI systems.

00:35:00
In this YouTube video, Sergey Levine discusses the similarities between learning-based systems and classic optimal control systems, and how the latter are becoming increasingly interpretable with deep learning. He also suggests that the descendants of symbolic AI will have a role in deep learning, as they are already able to implement rational decision-making by means of inference processes.

00:40:00
This video features Sergey Levine, a researcher in the field of robotics and machine learning, discussing the concept of "explained ability". Levine points out that, despite the inherent difficulties in verifying the truth of an AI system's explanations, humans still demand systems that are able to tell stories convincingly. This raises the question of whether or not the principles underlying AI systems, such as performance and reliability, are more important than the ability of those systems to explain themselves.

00:45:00
In this video, Sergey Levine discusses the differences between reinforcement learning and supervised machine learning, and how reinforcement learning can be used to solve problems that are more difficult to solve with supervised learning. The gap between reinforcement learning and supervised learning will likely close over the next few years as reinforcement learning algorithms acquire the ability to effectively utilize large amounts of prior data.

00:50:00
In this video, Sergey Levine discusses reinforcement learning, which is a subset of machine learning that deals with "what-if" questions. Levine discusses how models used in reinforcement learning can be unreliable, and how to overcome this by relying on off-policy data.

00:55:00
In this video, Sergey Levine discusses the recent advances in robotics and machine learning, highlighting the importance of high capacity neural networks for reinforcement learning. He points out that reinforcement learning can be approached in a very elegant way without a full model of the world, and discusses deep reinforcement learning.

01:00:00
In the video, Sergey Levine discusses how features are used in supervised learning, and how deep reinforcement learning is able to learn features in difficult control problems. He also talks about the limits of deep reinforcement learning and how we need to resolve deeper questions in order to make it scale to the real world.

01:05:00
In this video, Sergey Levine discusses how machine learning and robotics can be used to improve efficiency in various areas, including the kitchen. He also warns of the potential dangers of relying too heavily on simulation, and suggests that we need to build machines that can learn from real data in order to improve perpetually.

01:10:00
Sergey Levine discusses the possibility of creating realistic simulations that are sufficiently convincing to us humans, and the implications that has for reinforcement learning. He suggests that if this is possible, the human-robot interaction problem may not be as difficult as previously thought.

01:15:00
Sergey Levine discusses the phenomena of local local minima in theories, how Newtonian mechanics is not always easy to come by, and how self-play can be a powerful mechanism for reinforcement learning. He argues that reward functions should be written down as general objectives, and that unsupervised reinforcement learning is a promising area of research.

01:20:00
Sergey Levine is a researcher in the field of robotics and machine learning. He is particularly interested in the relationships between human and machine intelligence and the risks of unintended consequences of AI systems.

01:25:00
Sergey Levine discusses his thoughts on robotics and machine learning, sharing that he believes these technologies can teach humans about themselves. He also recommends books on one's own intellectual journey.

01:30:00
Sergey Levine discusses how he became interested in artificial intelligence, how it has influenced his career, and what advice he would give to someone interested in pursuing a career in AI. He also discusses the importance of having a reward function, and how one can develop confidence in their work by focusing on problems that matter.

01:35:00
Sergey Levine discusses the importance of dreaming big for both oneself and artificial intelligence, and talks about his dream of building a machine that can go as far as possible.
