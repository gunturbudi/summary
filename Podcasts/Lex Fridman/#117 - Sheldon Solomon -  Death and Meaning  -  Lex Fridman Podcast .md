Sheldon Solomon discusses the role of death in human life, arguing that our fear of death is at the core of the human condition. He discusses the effects of World War II on history, and how it has the potential to change everything. He also discusses the effects of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin on current events, and how their actions are not driven by political ideology, but through deep personal reflection. He asks for listeners' patience, empathy, and rigorous thinking, and asks them to unsubscribe if they feel partisan in their views.

00:05:00
Sheldon Solomon discusses the role of death in human existence, arguing that it is the primary motivating factor for almost everything people do. He refers to death as the "core" of our consciousness, and discusses how different conceptions of the human essence can be useful heuristically.

00:10:00
Sheldon Solomon discusses the idea of death as the "worm at the core of the human condition." He discusses how this understanding is similar to the idea of the "apple of the tree of knowledge," which is what brings death into the world. Solomon then recalls his first existential crisis, when he realized that he would eventually die.

00:15:00
Sheldon Solomon discusses the overlap between his personal experiences and theories found in books by Robert A. Baron and Thomas M. Becker. Solomon discusses how he came to believe that these theories are compatible and powerful when combined.

00:20:00
In this video, Sheldon Solomon discusses how he believes that knowledge has increased since the days of ancient Greece, but that it is not necessarily progress. He also discusses how psychologists can make mistakes in their assumptions about knowledge, and how he thinks that Jordan Peterson's work on meaning is important.

00:25:00
Sheldon Solomon and Lex Fridman discuss Sheldon Solomon's book "The Worm at the Core"; Solomon and Fridman disagree about Solomon's political beliefs, with Solomon arguing that both liberal and conservative political philosophies are bankrupt because they are based on false assumptions about human nature.

00:30:00
Sheldon Solomon argues that in a state of nature, individuals have the right to survive and acquire and preserve the fruits of their labor. He says this is the problem with the idea that people will let each other live in peace, because they are apt to take each other's property. In order to avoid this, people give up some of their freedom in exchange for security. The sole function of government is to keep domestic tranquility and ward off foreign evasion.

00:35:00
Sheldon Solomon argues that money has no intrinsic value, and that inequality is natural and beneficial. He says that the truly creative and innovative are entitled to relatively unlimited worth because we're all better off as a result.

00:40:00
Sheldon Solomon discusses how poverty is not that terrible, but it is uncomfortable when viewed from an inequality standpoint. He argues that the system is not broken, but that inequality is a part of our world and we should strive for equality of opportunity. He also discusses John Locke and how he disagrees with Marx's ideas.

00:45:00
Sheldon Solomon argues that capitalism can have negative consequences, and that the implementation of a socialist system would be more difficult than many people think. He also comments on the current controversy over whether or not Marx was a good thinker.

00:50:00
Sheldon Solomon discusses how humans are innately social creatures who are eager to reciprocate. He also discusses the role of fear of mortality in human behavior, and how Adam Smith used the concept of reciprocation to support the free market.

00:55:00
Sheldon Solomon discusses the idea that we are both selfish and cooperative, and how this affects our understanding of what political and economic institutions would be best suited to maximize individual autonomy while also engaging our more cooperative and reciprocal tendencies. He points to the current world as being in disagreement with prominent thinkers such as Stephen Pinker, who maintain that the world is getting better and that all we need to do is keep making and buying things. Solomon argues that the world is facing a potential catastrophic collapse in multiple directions, and that the economic pain that people are going through is a sign that things could get worse.

01:00:00
Sheldon Solomon discusses how people tend to find self-esteem in different ways in times of economic upheaval. He cites Max Weber and German sociologist Theodor W. Adorno, who both say that in times of upheaval, people will often embrace charismatic leaders who promise to bring back the good old days. These leaders often rely on hate and anger to mobilise their followers.

01:05:00
In the 2001 video "Sheldon Solomon: Death and Meaning," Ernest Becker discusses how death anxiety can influence our affection for charismatic leaders, both good and bad. Egghead experimental researchers Sheldon Solomon and Lex Fridman discuss this research in the 2009 video "Sheldon Solomon: Death and Meaning." Solomon and Fridman found that Americans approved of President George W. Bush following a death reminder, but they disapproved of him more when they were reminded of death first.

01:10:00
Sheldon Solomon discusses how death changes the way one sees life and how it is important to be aware of death in order to lead a full life. He also speaks about how sometimes death is a very subtle reminder and how it is important to confront death anxiety in order to move on.

01:15:00
Sheldon Solomon discusses the implications of his ideas about death and meaning in relation to self-esteem. He argues that we have to let go of our culturally-imposed notions of "dis ease" around death in order to become more mature individuals. He also discusses the ideas of Kierkegaard, who argued that we need to let go of our identities in order to rebuild ourselves. He argues that only through faith in Christ can we achieve this.

01:20:00
Sheldon Solomon discusses how cultural constructions can be the only thing that we can have faith in, but can also raise the question of whether or not these constructions are just death-denying beliefs. He then discusses how Martin Heidegger argues that death anxiety is the root of all human suffering, and how one must get to the point where they realize that they are going to die at any moment. Jean-Paul Sartre also makes a similar argument, but Heidegger is more precise in his definition of existential guilt.

01:25:00
Sheldon Solomon discusses Heidegger's idea of "anticipatory resoluteness," which he defines as a state of hopefulness in anticipation of future opportunities. Solomon argues that this concept is beautiful and resonates with the time, and he finishes by quoting a line from Heidegger's essay "On the Way to Language."

01:30:00
Sheldon Solomon discusses the ideas of Heidegger and Kierkegaard, discussing the idea that life is an adventure that is permeated with unshakeable joy, even in the face of death. He then discusses the idea that there is a leap of faith possible in our experience, in which we don't know what the future holds, but are capable of anything. Elon Musk is also discussed, as he is a figure who is constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible, despite some of his more unconventional behaviors.

01:35:00
Sheldon Solomon, a world-renowned scientist and entrepreneur, discusses the fear of death and its meaning in his book, "The Reality of Death." He argues that, whether or not someone is afraid of death, they should think deeply about it in order to find meaning in life.

01:40:00
Sheldon Solomon discusses the idea of death and meaning, explaining that it is a dangerous thought for those in society who rely on a certain narrative to function. He points out that the unwillingness to step outside of these comfortable narratives is disappointing, and that it is a common obstacle for those seeking to pursue philosophical inquiry.

01:45:00
Sheldon Solomon discusses the evolution and connection of religion and death. He cites Karen Armstrong as a non-turned historian who believes that religion has nothing to do with death, it is a social adaptation that arose to make groups viable. There are vigorous disagreements among scholars about the evolution of religion, but Solomon believes it is inextricably connected to our fears of death and it always returns in some shape or form.

01:50:00
Sheldon Solomon argues that all religions have some good and bad aspects, and that faith is essential to action.

01:55:00
Sheldon Solomon discusses the role of consciousness in the human mind and its possible evolutionary benefits. He argues that consciousness is not an afterthought, but is instead an important part of the mind's function.

02:00:00
Sheldon Solomon discusses his book about consciousness and mortality, and argues that consciousness is a social construct that helps us interact with other humans. Nietzsche's view is that thoughts of oneself would never come to mind, and that consciousness is the most calamitous stupidity by which we shall someday perish. Solomon concludes that, in a sense, death is always with us, and that van Gogh's one painting sales reflect this idea.

02:05:00
Sheldon Solomon discusses how influential philosophers Ernest Becker and Jean-Paul Sartre were, but argues that their work is not often discussed as highly as work by other philosophers. He discusses how this might be because their ideas are more empirical and corroborated than some of the more abstract thinkers. Solomon then discusses how his book, "Death and Meaning", is inspired by Heidegger and deals with the same question of what happens to artificial intelligence when they realize they are mortal.

02:10:00
Sheldon Solomon discusses the intuition that it is necessary for artificial intelligence to approximate humanity in order to create meaningful connections between the two. He believes that this is essential for the element of human experience, and that machine ethics must include a fear of mortality. Solomon also discusses the challenges of creating ethical AI, and how it must behave in a similar way to humans in order to be effective.

02:15:00
The video discusses the existential concerns of various philosophers, including Jean Paul Sartre, who argued that humans are fundamentally alone in the universe. It also discusses the idea of existential isolation, which is the feeling of being alone in the face of death.

02:20:00
Sheldon Solomon discusses the pressure to conform to conventional expectations in academia and how it can stifle creativity and innovation. He suggests that universities should encourage unconventional thinkers and welcome those who don't fit in.

02:25:00
Sheldon Solomon discusses the importance of face-to-face mentorship in his academic career. He talks about how he negotiated a five-year tenure at Skidmore College despite his early lack of publishing success. He also discusses his mentor, Ted Kuroda, and the importance of teaching students to think critically and not judge an idea by its appearance.

02:30:00
Sheldon Solomon discusses how he feels about the current state of technology and how it impacts the way we view death. He believes that we are quite far from creating a virtual reality experience that is as real as anything else, but he is hopeful that we will eventually get there. He also shares his thoughts on the importance of education and how charter schools do better than public schools.

02:35:00
Sheldon Solomon discusses three books by Ernest Becker that have had a profound impact on his life: The Birth and Death of Meaning, Escape from Evil, and The Plague. He recommends Carson McCullers' novel, Clock Without Hands, as a great read that tackles existential themes in a story format.

02:40:00
Sheldon Solomon discusses how he came to terms with his impending death and how it has impacted his outlook on life. He advises readers to seek out advice from those who have experience, and to be confident in their decisions.

02:45:00
Sheldon Solomon discusses the idea that life is to live and to do what's best for oneself. He advises against defining oneself by social or other variables that may be uncertain or temporary. Solomon takes himself too seriously and believes that intelligence is overrated, but he would still be proud of himself if he were known for his intelligence and not just his education.

02:50:00
Sheldon Solomon discusses his views on the meaning of life and his personal experiences that have led to these views. He credits Ernest Becker for inspiring the development of experimental existential psychology.

02:55:00
Sheldon Solomon discusses the idea that meaning comes from death, and how it has gotten into academic communities. He talks about his own admiration for Sheldon Solomon, and how it is an honor to have a conversation with him. He also thanks our sponsors Blinkist and Cash App, and tells listeners to give the podcast a rating and review on YouTube. Lastly, Vladimir Nabokov's words are played in the background.
