# Summary of Michael Kearns: Algorithmic Fairness, Privacy & Ethics | Lex Fridman Podcast #50

In this video, Michael Kearns discusses the idea of algorithmic fairness, privacy, and ethics. He argues that while algorithmic progress has been made, there is still much to be done in terms of understanding the limitations of fairness and its implications for society as a whole. He suggests that humans should play a more active role in setting these boundaries, rather than leaving it to machines.
Michael Kearns discusses the importance of ethical algorithms and the need for more mixing of computer scientists with other disciplines in order to create a more powerful and influential field. He also talks about differential privacy, and how it can be used to protect personal data while still allowing for certain uses.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Michael Kern discusses his book "Ethical Algorithm: A Guide to Moral, Legal and Social Implications of Computing" and how it impacts the field of algorithmic fairness, privacy, and ethics. He also mentions his uncle, a moral philosopher, and how he would consult him on technical issues related to fairness.

00:05:00
Michael Kearns discusses the philosophical divide between those who think algorithms can be fair and those who believe that they are inherently unfair. He argues that the latter view is more accurate, as most people do have both good and evil within them.

00:10:00
In this video, Michael Kearns discusses algorithmic fairness, privacy, and ethics. He notes that even the things that don't make sense to the outside world don't seem unusual to you and that you learn more when you're in that world. He discusses an example of an algorithm, sorting cards, and points out that it's also a bad algorithm. He goes on to discuss Silicon Valley and its problems with privacy and fairness. He asks basic questions about the nature of reality in hopes of gaining a deeper understanding.

00:15:00
The Lex Fridman podcast discusses algorithmic fairness, privacy, and ethics. The podcast discusses definitions of fairness, the importance of worst case analysis, and the parallels between fairness and worst case analysis.

00:20:00
The video discusses the idea of "algorithmic fairness," or the idea that algorithms should be fair to all members of a group, even if this is a weaker concept than individual fairness. Michael Kearns discusses the need for more human subject research in this area, as well as the importance of computer scientists and psychologists working together.

00:25:00
The video discusses the concept of "group fairness," which is the idea that different groups should be treated equally. The presenter notes that this is often difficult to achieve, as individual characteristics can have a large impact on outcome. They then go on to discuss a research project in which they are trying to develop algorithms that can guarantee group fairness. While this is an important goal, the presenter notes that it is still very difficult to achieve.

00:30:00
Michael Kearns discusses the concepts of fairness, privacy, and ethics in relation to algorithmic systems. He notes that fairness is a loaded topic, and that for researchers attempting to design fair algorithms, they must also engage in broader public debates about the ethical implications of technology.

00:35:00
Michael Kearns discusses the trade-offs between accuracy and fairness in machine learning systems. He notes that, while it is possible to improve one dimension without sacrificing the other, in the near term, machine learning systems may need to interface with policymakers in order to make fair decisions.

00:40:00
The video discusses the concept of fairness, and how it can be difficult to create an algorithm that is fair to all groups. It also explores the idea of discrimination in machine learning, and how it can be a costly process.

00:45:00
The book discusses how computer scientists make decisions that have a significant impact on society, and how these decisions can be encoded into algorithms. One misconception is that the computer scientists themselves decide what social norms should be, and the book insists that this is not the case.

00:50:00
Michael Kearns discusses the consequences of using machine learning to optimize social media platforms for engagement and explains how difficult it is to measure the effects of such optimizations. He argues that the current state of social media platforms is a bad equilibrium, where we all optimize for our own self-interest and exacerbate divisions within society. He suggests that we need to rethink how we optimize social media platforms in order to create a more equitable and beneficial society.

00:55:00
The author discusses the idea of algorithmic fairness, privacy, and ethics. He argues that while algorithmic progress has been made, there is still much to be done in terms of understanding the limitations of fairness and its implications for society as a whole. He suggests that humans should play a more active role in setting these boundaries, rather than leaving it to machines.

01:00:00
Computer scientists discuss the importance of ethical algorithms and the need for more mixing of computer scientists with other disciplines in order to create a more powerful and influential field.

01:05:00
Differential privacy is a better concept of privacy than anonymization, which is the most common way to provide data privacy. Differential privacy removes personally identifying information while still allowing people access to the data.

01:10:00
Differential privacy is a technique for protecting privacy in situations in which certain data is necessary for a specific study. It says that any harms that might come to an individual as a result of being included in a study are nearly identical to harms that would have occurred if that same study had not included that individual's data.

01:15:00
The video discusses differential privacy, and how by adding noise to a computation, it can be ensured that nobody can pinpoint the individual inputs used to produce the output. This is important for protecting privacy, as many algorithms can be performed without any privacy considerations.

01:20:00
Michael Kearns discusses the idea of privacy by obfuscation, which is a way to protect personal data while still allowing for certain uses. He believes that, in the future, society will have to find a way to balance the desire for privacy with the need for data to be used for beneficial purposes.

01:25:00
Game theory is a mathematical framework used to study collective outcomes in systems of interacting individuals. Michael Kearns has worked on developing algorithms that can be used to model and study complex systems, and he is optimistic that algorithmic fairness and privacy will one day be improved.

01:30:00
The article discusses how, under certain circumstances, a competitive equilibrium can emerge in systems where multiple actors are trying to optimize their own self-interest. This is a key contribution to the field of algorithmic game theory.

01:35:00
Michael Kearns discusses the role of algorithms in space of trading investment and securities. He notes that, in the time he has spent in the financial sector, the use of algorithms has progressed from automated trading of large, high-volume orders to high-frequency trading of smaller orders. Kearns believes that, in the future, algorithms will increasingly dominate areas such as stock market predictions and financial exchange optimization.

01:40:00
Michael Kearns discusses the mechanics of trading and how quant hedge funds are successful. He also discusses how long-term directional predictions can be made in asset prices, and how machine learning can be used for macroeconomic prediction. He says that, despite the opportunities, Wall Street is still safe from the bots.

01:45:00
Michael Kearns discusses the struggles of transitioning from being a student to a researcher, and how his academic background helped him in making the transition. He tells a story about how he realized he would stick it out and finish his graduate program, and how that moment changed his life.
