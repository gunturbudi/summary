Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Leslie Kaelbling is a roboticist and professor at MIT who is known for her work in reinforcement learning, planning, and navigation. She also discusses philosophical concepts related to artificial intelligence.

00:05:00
Leslie Kaelbling discusses her love of robotics, and how she first became interested in the field. She mentions that, as technology progressed, the gap between the technical gap and the philosophical gap widened. However, she does not see the gap as being more than a technical one. She talks about her experience working on a robot project, and how reinvention was important in order to achieve success. She also discusses reinforcement learning, and how she sees it as a way to incorporating human emotions into a machine.

00:10:00
Lex Fridman discusses the challenges of creating artificial intelligence that behaves like a human, and how these challenges may be overcome in the future.

00:15:00
The main points of this talk are that computer science tells us what the right answer to all these questions is, and that abstraction is a way to reduce the size of the state space and the horizon of reasoning. The talk also covers symbolic reasoning, discrete models, and Markov decision processes.

00:20:00
Leslie Kaelbling discusses the state of reinforcement learning, planning, and robotics, noting that while the field is still developing, it is important to keep in mind the limitations of the current models. She talks about the difficulty of optimal planning under uncertainty and the need for theoretical work in this area.

00:25:00
The video discusses Leslie Kaelbling's idea that we need to formalize principles behind reinforcement learning algorithms in order to make them more predictable and easier to use. He argues that the difference between state space and belief space is that state space is about understanding the world as it is, while belief space is about understanding the world as we believe it to be. This idea can be used to solve problems involving information gathering and decision making.

00:30:00
In this video, Leslie Kaelbling discusses the concept of abstraction and how it can be used to make plans for tasks at a high level of abstraction. She also discusses how humans learn to make predictions about difficult sub goals and how this can be used to improve hierarchical reasoning in AI planning.

00:35:00
In this video, Leslie Kaelbling discusses the importance of understanding how pieces of information must be put together in order for a machine to learn. He also speaks about the importance of bias and how it can help reduce the complexity of a problem.

00:40:00
Leslie Kaelbling discusses the importance of perceptual learning and how it helps to build a more intelligent robot. She also talks about the potential for artificial intelligence competitions and the importance of benchmarking.

00:45:00
The Journal of AI Research was started in response to the journal Machine Learning being too expensive for libraries to subscribe to. The Journal of AI Research is open access and has no page charges or access restrictions. Leslie Kaelbling, one of the founders of the journal, reviews papers for the journal. He disagrees with one of his past reviews and makes it better.

00:50:00
Leslie Kaelbling discusses the challenges and opportunities of continuing to advance artificial intelligence, and how the cycles of growth and decline are inevitable. He is hopeful about the potential of artificial intelligence, but is concerned about the current trajectory of research and development.

00:55:00
Leslie Kaelbling discusses the importance of objective functions in planning and robotics, and how to best optimize them. She provides an example of a machine learning model that falls short of its objective, and suggests a middle ground between over-engineering and no engineering at all.

01:00:00
Leslie Kaelbling discusses reinforcement learning, planning, and robotics with Lex Fridman. She emphasizes the importance of learning and not learning, and discusses the various projects she's been involved in. She also discusses her love for the process of engineering, and how research is important to her because it's fun.
