# Summary of MIT 6.S094: Deep Learning for Human-Centered Semi-Autonomous Vehicles

The video discusses deep learning and how it can be used to improve driver-facing autonomous vehicles. The author recommends reading a deep learning book and looking for papers and blogs on the subject.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
This video discusses the need for deep learning on the human side of semi- and fully-autonomous vehicles, as well as the benefits of having a driver facing camera.

00:05:00
This deep learning class discusses how to use a CNN to predict body poses, including looking at the eyes. The class also discusses how to remove noise and vibrations from the footage, and how to personalize the network to the individual. This allows the network to be more accurate in predicting the driver's state.

00:10:00
The video discusses deep learning for human-centered semi-autonomous vehicles. The process of deep learning is explained, and various tasks that can be done with deep learning are mentioned. Convolutional neural networks are shown to be particularly effective for face alignment and cognitive load prediction.

00:15:00
This video discusses how deep learning is improving the ability of autonomous vehicles to interpret human behavior, with particular reference to the ability to detect and interpret expressions of emotion. The video also discusses the importance of cognitive load in this process, and provides a brief overview of how micro saccades can be used to measure it.

00:20:00
This video explains how deep learning can be used to detect various types of cognitive load, including low, medium, and high levels, and then predict the corresponding class. The video also shows how this can be done using a 3D CNN model.

00:25:00
This video discusses deep learning and how it can be used to improve driver-facing autonomous vehicles. The author recommends reading a deep learning book and looking for papers and blogs on the subject.

00:30:00
This video introduces the "MIT 6.S094: Deep Learning for Human-Centered Semi-Autonomous Vehicles" class, which is designed to help students develop deep learning skills for autonomous vehicles. Three winners were announced of a competition in which they had to achieve the fastest speed using deep learning algorithms.
