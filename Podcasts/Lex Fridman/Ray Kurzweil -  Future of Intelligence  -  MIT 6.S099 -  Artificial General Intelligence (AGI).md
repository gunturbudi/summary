Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Ray Kurzweil is a noted inventor and futurist who has made accurate predictions about the future of intelligence. He is the co-founder and chancellor of singularity University, and a director of engineering at Google. He was the principal investigator of the first ccd flatbed scanner, the first omni font optical character recognition, the first point-to-point text-to-speech synthesizer, and the first music synthesizer capable of creating grand pianos. He has also received a Grammy Award for outstanding achievements in music technology.

Ray Kurzweil discusses the exponential growth of computing and its effects on artificial general intelligence (AGI). By using massive nets and evaluating the quality of boards at each point, alphago has been able to learn from human-created examples and achieve superhuman performance. Additionally, Kurzweil discusses autonomous vehicles and their need for real-world data in order to be realistic. Finally, he mentions how humans are able to learn from a small number of examples, even those provided by their significant other.

Ray Kurzweil, director of engineering at Google, gives a talk on the future of artificial intelligence at MIT. He discusses how the neocortex, a thin layer of neurons in the brain, is organized in a hierarchy, and how evidence from neuroscience supports the idea that the neocortex grows axons from one place to another.

00:15:00
Ray Kurzweil discusses the neocortex, its hierarchy and role in human development. He explains that the neocortex is responsible for creativity, language and art, and that it has doubled in size since the Cretaceous extinction event. He predicts that the neocortex will continue to grow, leading to the emergence of even more complex cognitive abilities in humans and other primates.

00:20:00
Ray Kurzweil, a futurist and computer scientist, discusses the future of intelligence and how artificial intelligence (AI) will continue to evolve and improve. He believes that AI will surpass average human performance in many areas, including language and comprehension.

00:25:00
Ray Kurzweil discusses the future of artificial intelligence, highlighting the potential for hierarchical models to improve the quality of AI suggestions. He also discusses the potential for combining neural networks with symbolic models, which he believes will help improve the accuracy of life expectancy predictions.

00:30:00
Ray Kurzweil discusses the possibility of artificial general intelligence (AGI), which could lead to the automation of many jobs. He predicts that the singularity will occur by 2045, at which point artificial intelligence will be so powerful that it will render many jobs obsolete. However, this will not be the end of human civilization as new jobs will be created.

00:35:00
Ray Kurzweil predicts that, by 2015, only 2% of the workforce will be working in farming and 9% in factories, due to automation. He also predicts that, by 2030, artificial intelligence (AI) will have surpassed human intelligence, and that we will be able to merge with AI to further enhance our capabilities.

00:40:00
Ray Kurzweil speaks about the exponential growth of technology and how it has led to major milestones such as artificial general intelligence. He emphasizes the importance of taking measures to minimize exposure to potential existential risks, and suggests strategies for designing engineered systems and social and economic institutions.

00:45:00
Ray Kurzweil discusses the potential dangers of artificial intelligence and how we can prevent them. He believes that we need to practice ethics in order to keep these technologies safe and that we are already on the path to a better future.

00:50:00
Ray Kurzweil discusses how technology is advancing exponentially and how this is helping to improve many aspects of life. He also discusses the potential for technology to disrupt the current trend of increasing violence.
