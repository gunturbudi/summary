Andrew Strominger discusses the theory of black holes and how they are defined, explaining that a black hole is a region of space-time from which light can never escape. He also explains that one explanation for why light does not escape from a black hole is that it carries energy and is subject to a gravitational pull.

00:05:00
In this video, Professor Andrew Strominger discusses the theory of relativity and its implications for the existence of black holes. He notes that the speed limit for objects in the universe is the speed of light, and that even light cannot escape from these very massive regions of space-time. Einstein himself didn't believe in the existence of black holes, but later came to accept their existence after discovering the solution to the field equations.

00:10:00
In 1968, mathematician Andrew Strominger developed a coordinate transformation that could be used to map all weather stations across the United States into a single map. However, this transformation proved to be imperfect because it broke down at the point of a black hole. Einstein later corrected this mistake, proving that black holes are real.

00:15:00
In this video, Andrew Strominger explains why theories like Maxwell's and Newton's never completely described reality and why there is always some degree of inaccuracy. He also explains how quantum mechanics makes corrections to these theories, which leads to the singularity. Finally, he discusses how Einstein's theory of gravity is a very robust and accurate theory that still explains many aspects of the universe.

00:20:00
According to the speaker, the tension between quantum mechanics and general relativity hints at some deeper understanding that will be discovered in the next century.

00:25:00
Quantum gravity is a theory that describes everything with astonishing accuracy. The theory has been successfully compared to 16 decimal place, and it unifies the electromagnetic interaction with the so-called weak interaction. There are multiple efforts to understand quantum gravity, but none have been successful yet.

00:30:00
String theory is a theory that has the potential to explain how gravity and quantum mechanics work together, but it is still under development and has not yet been ruled out as an actual unified theory of nature.

00:35:00
In this video, Andrew Strominger discusses the possibility that string theory could one day be viewed as a stepping stone towards a greater understanding of nature. He notes that while string theory is not currently correct, it is still a valuable theory and is likely to continue to evolve.

00:40:00
Andrew Strominger discusses black holes and the theoretical physics that has led to their understanding. He explains that black holes are holes in space and that, according to quantum mechanics and general relativity, they should be unable to store any information. However, Strominger and his colleague Cameron Valpha were able to show that strings in theory can reproduce Einstein's theory of general relativity and correct it for black holes. This suggests that black holes may actually be able to store information.

00:45:00
In this video, Professor Andrew Strominger discusses black holes, quantum gravity, and the holographic principle. He explains that black holes cannot store information, and that Einstein's theory is not exact. String theory tells us what the corrections to Einstein's theory are, and Hawking and Bernstein showed that physics is inconsistent unless a black hole can store an amount of information proportional to its area divided by four times Newton's constant times Planck's Constant. The holographic principle is the principle that says information can be stored on the boundary of a region, and is one of the huge problems in physics. Flat space is just an approximation of the world we live in, while asymptotic decider space is the space we live in as the universe continues to expand.

00:50:00
In this video, Andrew Strominger discusses black holes, quantum gravity, and the theorizing process. He explains that space and time can be curved, and that this curvature is affected by the matter in the universe. He also discusses the cosmological constant, which is a mysterious force that is believed to be responsible for the universe's expansion. Finally, he discusses the idea that all constants could be said to be related to the speed of light, and why this is a complex topic.

00:55:00
Physicist Andrew Strominger discusses the theory of string theory, which allowed for the discovery of an alternate description of black holes that solves two problems. In addition, the theory helped to solve the Hawking's problem, and it was very beautiful.

01:00:00
In this video, Andrew Strominger discusses black holes and how they arise as a projection of a holographic plate. He also explains how string theory can be used to describe things in two different languages--holographic plate theory and string theory. This allows for applications of string theory in fields such as quantum gravity and the Hawking radiation problem.

01:05:00
According to physicist Andrew Strominger, black holes have no hair and are described by their mass and spin. He also says that it is important to be careful when approaching the boundary of a black hole because what happens there is very subtle. This information invalidates Steven Hawking's original argument that information is destroyed when a black hole is created.

01:10:00
In this video, Andrew Strominger discusses black holes, quantum gravity, and the theory of relativity. He explains that if something has zero energy and is spread throughout the universe, it is not actually there. He goes on to say that if you ignore these things, you will get inconsistencies in your physics. He also notes that if you are very precise about these things, you can answer some problematic statements made by Hawking.

01:15:00
Andrew Strominger discusses black holes, quantum gravity, and theoretical physics with Lex Fridman. He discusses the difference between physics and mathematics, his love for math, and his interest in questions that can't be easily answered. He says that mathematics is just discovered, and that it is linked to the physical world.

01:20:00
Physicist Andrew Strominger discusses the possibility of experimental validation of string theory, and how the field has evolved since he first started graduate school. He also discusses the most interesting problem that he believes may be solved in the next 60 years.

01:25:00
In this video, theoretical physicist Andrew Strominger discusses the paradox of modern physics – that we can't see to the end of the universe, but this isn't a reason to give up on the quest. He also discusses the role of philosophy in science, and the difficulty of understanding cellular automata – a type of complex mathematical system. Stephen Wolfram, a mathematician and computer scientist, makes a similar argument in his book A New Kind of Science.

01:30:00
The video discusses physicist Andrew Strominger's opinion that physics departments will never be able to completely solve the questions asked of it, and that there will always be more questions that need answering in the field of theoretical physics. Strominger also talks about the potential for artificial intelligence to eventually be able to predict the behavior of physical objects with great accuracy.

01:35:00
The speaker talks about the theory of everything and how it is a difficult task to achieve. He also talks about how the universe has a beginning, and how this challenges determinism. He also talks about string theory and how it has not had much success in explaining the origins of the universe.

01:40:00
In a recent paper, physicists identify emergent symmetries in the intricate self-similar structure of photon rings. These symmetries could be important in understanding the origin and evolution of time, and could lead to new ways of reversing engineer the past.

01:45:00
The video features theoretical physicist Andrew Strominger discussing his work on black holes, quantum gravity, and the theoretical physics behind the famous "Donut of M87" photograph. Strominger discusses how his work on the black hole image has led to new understandings about the surrounding matter and the nature of black holes. He also discusses the importance of talking to experts outside of one's comfort zone and how this leads to new discoveries.

01:50:00
In this video, Professor Andrew Strominger discusses how black holes are mirrors that allow photons to enter and exit the event horizon, resulting in an infinite number of copies of the observer.

01:55:00
This YouTube video discusses a new idea suggested in a paper published in "Nature" about a photon ring of a warped black hole being part of the black hole hologram. This idea is not new, but the video provides evidence that it might be more plausible than the existing idea that the holographic plate sits at the horizon of the black hole. This could lead to new insights into how black holes are described by quantum systems.

02:00:00
Andrew Strominger discusses how thought experiments can help make progress in theoretical physics, and how they've helped him progress over the years. He also mentions that, while most problems in theoretical physics are solvable, there are also some that are "very interesting" and "almost impossible to solve."

02:05:00
This YouTube video features Andrew Strominger, a theoretical physicist who has made several significant discoveries in the field of string theory. He discusses some of the theories he has developed, as well as how exciting it is to think about possible alien civilizations that may be out there trying to understand the universe.

02:10:00
In this video, Professor Andrew Strominger discusses black holes, quantum gravity, and theoretical physics. He says that while we understand concepts such as intelligence and consciousness very well, our understanding of mathematics and physics is much more limited. He argues that some aspects of nuclear weapons are based on assumptions that are not always justified and that the reality of nuclear weapons does not depend on the brilliance of the people who designed and built them.
