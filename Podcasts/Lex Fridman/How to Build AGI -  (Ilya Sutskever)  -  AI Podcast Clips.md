# Summary of How to Build AGI? (Ilya Sutskever) | AI Podcast Clips

Ilya Sutskever discusses the components required for building AGI, highlighting the importance of deep learning and self-play in producing novel and creative solutions to problems. He believes that transferring the capabilities of self-play from simulation to real-world scenarios is possible, as demonstrated by OpenAI's Rubik's Cube solving robot hand. Sutskever discusses the limitations of AGI systems that do not have bodies and suggests that consciousness may be achievable if artificial neural nets are sufficiently similar to the human brain. Additionally, he stresses the importance of not criticizing AI models for making mistakes, as they might prove to be much smarter than humans in many areas. Finally, Sutskever discusses the possibility of programming an AGI with a deep drive to help humans flourish, aligning its values with human values, and relinquishing enough power for it to function properly.

In this section, Ilya Sutskever discusses the components necessary for building AGI, or human level intelligence. He believes that deep learning plus self-play will be an important part of this process. Self-play has the ability to produce truly novel and creative solutions to problems, a crucial aspect of AGI. While self-play has been used mainly in simulation or game contexts, Sutskever believes that transferring these capabilities from simulation to the real world is definitely possible and has already been demonstrated in many cases, such as the Rubik's Cube solving robot hand created by OpenAI. He expects the transfer capabilities of deep learning to increase over time.

In this section, Ilya Sutskever believes that having a body is very useful but not necessary for an AGI system, and such systems have limitations that can be overcome. There are examples of people who have been able to compensate for their lack of capabilities and still be successful. Sutskever believes that it is possible for AI systems to have consciousness if artificial neural nets are sufficiently similar to the human brain. He admits that the concept of consciousness is difficult to define, but he believes that if the brain is not more complicated or interesting than we give it credit for, consciousness should show up in AI systems at some point. Sutskever thinks that a deep learning system that can solve a pedestrian task with no mistakes that humans would make would be impressive progress. Lastly, he discourages people from criticizing AI models for making mistakes since they might prove to be much smarter than humans in many things.

In this section, Ilya Sutskever discusses the progress of AI and how it's hard to judge progress in AI. He mentions that humans don't make mistakes that these AI models make and one anecdotal case of failure can convince the public that the system is not intelligent. He also talks about what he would do if he had an AGI system, discussing a democratic process where AGI represents people who vote for what AGI represents them should do. He also believes that it's definitely possible to build AI systems which will want to be controlled by humans, and it's part of their objective to be controlled like human parents generally control their children.

In this section, Ilya Sutskever discusses the possibility of programming an AGI with a deep drive to help humans flourish and how important it is to relinquish enough power for AGI to function properly. He draws a comparison to how parents are excited to help their children succeed and believe that AGI can be programmed in a similar way. Sutskever finds it trivial to relinquish control over an AGI system and believes that most people can be better than we think, but it is an open question whether most people are good. He also discusses aligning AGI values to human values and suggests the idea of an objective perception system that would be trained separately to recognize human judgments and integrated as the base value function for a more capable RL system.
