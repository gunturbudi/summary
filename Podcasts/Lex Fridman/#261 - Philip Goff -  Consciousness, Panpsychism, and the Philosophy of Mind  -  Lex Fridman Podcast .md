# Summary of Philip Goff: Consciousness, Panpsychism, and the Philosophy of Mind | Lex Fridman Podcast #261

Philip Goff discusses consciousness, panpsychism, and the philosophy of mind. He argues that consciousness is what makes life worthwhile, and that it is important to have experts who have traveled and thought about the topic deeply.
Philip Goff discusses the idea of panpsychism, which is the view that consciousness is a fundamental feature of the physical world and that it exists at all levels of existence. He explains that the panpsychist approach turns the standard approach to the problem of consciousness on its head, and that consciousness can be understood in terms of the behavior of simple conscious entities. Goff believes that materialism cannot account for the data, but that dualism can.
Philip Goff discusses consciousness, panpsychism, and the philosophy of mind on Lex Fridman's podcast. He believes that panpsychism is a plausible theory, and that consciousness may be irreducible to underlying physics and chemistry. He also discusses the idea that some people may be zombies, or machines designed to do what they are programmed to do, and argues that these people do not have moral rights.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Philip Goff discusses the idea that consciousness is fundamental and ubiquitous, and that it is not observable in the same way as things like particles and waves. He also talks about the need for a more expansive conception of the scientific method in order to understand consciousness.

00:05:00
Philip Goff explains the difference between his view of consciousness, which he calls panpsychism, and Daniel Dennett's view of consciousness, which he calls heterophenomenology. Goff defends panpsychism on the grounds that it can account for the datum of consciousness that we are immediately aware of. Dennett, on the other hand, argues that the data for science of consciousness is what he calls heterophenomenology, which is specifically defined as what we can access from the third person perspective including what people say. Dennett feels that relying on people's testimony as evidence for some unobservable realm of feelings and experiences is not justified.

00:10:00
Philip Goff discusses consciousness, panpsychism, and the philosophy of mind. He argues that there is a deeper view of what consciousness is, and that consciousness is almost the side effect of a massively parallel computation system going on in the brain. He also argues that the multiple drafts model of consciousness is defended by Luke Roloff.

00:15:00
Philip Goff discusses the philosophy of mind, consciousness, and panpsychism. He discusses the importance of terminology, and argues that narratives may be a plausible contender for a theory of the self. He also discusses the limits of experience in the case of a hamster, and argues that consciousness is something that is required for certain experiences in life, but is not necessary for all of them.

00:20:00
Philip Goff discusses the idea that goals can be pursued without necessarily enjoying the resulting pleasure, and how this perspective can lead to the conclusion that some goals are objectively pointless. He then goes on to argue that this position is incompatible with David Hume's idea that pleasure is the "key to life."

00:25:00
Philip Goff discusses the concept of pleasure and argues that it is more broadly than just a short-term pleasure. He also discusses the idea of goal-based pleasure and how it is impossible to have a goal and not experience some degree of pleasure in the process.

00:30:00
Philip Goff discusses consciousness, panpsychism, and the philosophy of mind, and argues that consciousness is what makes life worthwhile. He also discusses the fear of death and its relationship to self-reflection.

00:35:00
Philip Goff explains panpsychism and its implications for the philosophy of mind. According to panpsychism, the fundamental nature of reality is constituted of consciousness, and even when individual aspects of our conscious experience fall away, the underlying universal consciousness remains. This could provide a basis for altruism and non-egotism, as we would see ourselves as overlapping to an extent with universal consciousness.

00:40:00
Philip Goff discusses consciousness, panpsychism, and the philosophy of mind. He argues that there is something fundamental about us humans that binds us together as a single mind, and that this social aspect is important. Australian philosopher Mirial Bahari defends a mystical conception of reality, based on advice from a Dante mystic. Goff believes that experienced meditators provide expert testimony, and that we should think of them as providing testimony on the existence of a universal consciousness. He thinks that scientism, a conception of how science is supposed to be conducted, gets into people's minds and can be a source of security.

00:45:00
Philip Goff discusses consciousness, panpsychism, and the philosophy of mind. He argues that it is important to have experts who have traveled and thought about the topic deeply, and to protect academic institutions from conflicts of interest.

00:50:00
Philip Goff discusses consciousness, panpsychism, and the philosophy of mind. He argues that so-called experts often dismiss what millions of people are saying online without engaging with the evidence. Goff suggests that democracy is the worst system of government, and that with respect to psychisms, we should be humble and open-minded in our pursuit of knowledge.

00:55:00
Philip Goff discusses the problems with experts and how to communicate your ideas to the wider world without losing credibility. He also recommends reading his books, "consciousness" and "Galileo's Era: Foundations for a New Science of Consciousness."

01:00:00
Philip Goff discusses the argument from the fine-tuning of the laws of physics for life to the multiverse, which is a popular argument in academic philosophy but which has been disputed by some physicists. Goff argues that the argument is from 20-30 years ago and that it is important for philosophers to have objections raised to their arguments in order to keep them open to criticism.

01:05:00
Philip Goff discusses consciousness, panpsychism, and the philosophy of mind, arguing that there are problems with materialism and dualism. He argues that consciousness cannot be explained in purely quantitative terms, and that we have no good evidence for either position on dualism. He also argues that, while materialism has some problems, we have more evidence for it than for dualism.

01:10:00
Philip Goff discusses the idea of panpsychism, which is the view that consciousness is a fundamental feature of the physical world and that it exists at all levels of existence. He explains that the panpsychist approach turns the standard approach to the problem of consciousness on its head, and that consciousness can be understood in terms of the behavior of simple conscious entities. Goff believes that materialism cannot account for the data, but that dualism can.

01:15:00
Philip Goff discusses panpsychism, which is the idea that consciousness and physical reality are intertwined. He says that while physics may be complete in describing behavior, it does not describe matter at its most fundamental level. Goff argues that this is not a problem, as we can explore other possibilities without conflicting with the rest of physics.

01:20:00
Philip Goff discusses the possibility that consciousness is just another entity in the universe, and that it is not beyond the reach of empirical validation. He argues that this is more within the reach of being explained by science, as opposed to a philosophical view.

01:25:00
Philip Goff discusses consciousness, panpsychism, and the philosophy of mind in this Lex Fridman podcast. Goff argues that consciousness is a radically different explanatory task from other tasks of science, and that we need to account for subjective qualities like redness in terms of simpler mechanisms. He also discusses the mother why question- why do certain brain activities correspond to certain types of conscious experience? Although Goff believes it is possible to measure consciousness, he doesn't think we can answer the why question fully.

01:30:00
Philip Goff discusses consciousness, panpsychism, and the philosophy of mind with Lex Fridman. He believes that consciousness cannot be explained by experiments, but must go hand-in-hand with an integrated information theory. Goff is attracted to the integrated information theory, which claims that consciousness exists at the level of the most integrated information. He discusses how complexity and levels of information correlate with integrated information in the brain, and how this theory might explain gradable qualities in qualitative consciousness. He admits that this concept is difficult to understand, but he is open-minded about the theory. Goff talks about suffering and how an experience, such as his own, can be graded in terms of complexity and levels of information.

01:35:00
Philip Goff discusses consciousness, panpsychism, and the philosophy of mind, emphasizing the connection between suffering and consciousness. He believes that, although consciousness is deeply connected to suffering, it is also a deeply individual experience.

01:40:00
Philip Goff argues that consciousness does not exist, and that this eliminates the need to explain consciousness. If consciousness does not exist, then there is no pain, and so morality does not exist. He also argues that if plants and trees are conscious, then it is better not to eat them because they do not suffer the same way as animals do.

01:45:00
Philip Goff discusses consciousness, panpsychism, and the philosophy of mind with Lex Fridman. They discuss agreements and disagreements, and Goff argues that panpsychism can account for mental causation.

01:50:00
Philip Goff discusses the role of consciousness in the universe, and how it contributes to the development of human civilization. He says that while consciousness is not unique, it does have a lot of value, and that, when viewed from the perspective of physics, it is clear that consciousness does a lot of work.

01:55:00
Philip Goff discusses consciousness, panpsychism, and the philosophy of mind, arguing that while robots may not have conscious experiences in the same way humans do, they may still be conscious in some sense. He also raises the question of whether or not we will be able to determine empirically whether or not a particular robot is conscious.

02:00:00
Philip Goff discusses consciousness, panpsychism, and the philosophy of mind on Lex Fridman's podcast. He believes that panpsychism is a plausible theory, and that consciousness may be irreducible to underlying physics and chemistry. He also discusses the idea that some people may be zombies, or machines designed to do what they are programmed to do, and argues that these people do not have moral rights.

02:05:00
Philip Goff discusses the distinction between explaining consciousness in terms of brain activity and explaining it in terms of chemicals in the brain. He argues that there is a deeper question that needs to be answered, namely why these chemicals go along with certain experiences rather than others.

02:10:00
Philip Goff discusses consciousness, panpsychism, and the philosophy of mind with Lex Fridman. Goff believes that it is important to try to study and understand consciousness in order to then go back and describe how the different chemicals interact and create different experiences. He mentions that there is a trip to Russia upcoming that involves a few conversations in Russian. He is also interested in science in Russia in artificial intelligence and computer science, as well as these fascinating philosophical explorations.

02:15:00
Philip Goff discusses the relationship between free will and consciousness, and argues that free will and illusion are both subject to more agnostic thinking than is usually the case.

02:20:00
Philip Goff discusses consciousness and panpsychism, arguing that while we don't have the certainty of the existence of free will that we do in the case of consciousness, free will may still be an illusion. Goff also discusses how we can build intuitions about free will, and how it is more amenable to physics than the experience of consciousness.

02:25:00
Philip Goff discusses how free will is different than mindless actions and argues that free choice involves responsiveness to reasons. Jonathan Lowe makes an argument that free will is a response to reasons, which Goff agrees with. Carroll argues that if free will conflicts with physics, then physics is wrong. Goff argues that we can't know whether free will conflicts with physics yet, and so we should focus on the standard model of particle physics.

02:30:00
Philip Goff discusses consciousness, panpsychism, and the philosophy of mind with Sean Carroll. Goff is not sure if strong emergence in the brain would mean that free will does not exist in principle, but he is interested in the concept nonetheless. He thinks that, by understanding intelligence and consciousness, we can begin to understand free will.

02:35:00
Philip Goff discusses consciousness, panpsychism, and the philosophy of mind with Lex Fridman. Goff believes that consciousness is the stuff of the brain and that it is substrate independent. He worries that if we upload our minds into computers, we might be committing suicide.

02:40:00
Philosopher Philip Goff discusses the significance of consciousness and panpsychism in relation to the question of meaning and value in life. He argues that the official scientific world view is incompatible with the reality of consciousness and that people have a deep intuition that there is a purpose to existence. Goff believes that hope is a worthwhile and fulfilling way to live.

02:45:00
Philip Goff discusses consciousness, panpsychism, and the philosophy of mind with Lex Fridman. He argues that consciousness cannot be explained in terms of the physical brain and that the human mind is a product of evolution.
