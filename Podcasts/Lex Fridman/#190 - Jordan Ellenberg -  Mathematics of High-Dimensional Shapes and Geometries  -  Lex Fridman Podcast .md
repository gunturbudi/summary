# Summary of Jordan Ellenberg: Mathematics of High-Dimensional Shapes and Geometries | Lex Fridman Podcast #190

Jordan Ellenberg discusses the mathematics of high-dimensional shapes and geometries in this Lex Fridman podcast. He discusses how a two-dimensional creature could comprehend a three-dimensional world, and how mathematics can be used to explore the universe beyond our understanding. If the answer to whether extra dimensions exist is no, it would become a sterile question.

The video discusses Jordan Ellenberg's book Mathematics of High-Dimensional Shapes and Geometries, which discusses the Square and the Sphere's differing perspectives on what a cube would be like. The Sphere explains that a cube would be like a three-dimensional version of the Square, while the Square is excited to finally understand what a cube would be like. However, the Sphere is unable to conceptualize that there could be yet another dimension, leading to a religious allegory that I don't really understand theologically. The video finishes by discussing how each person's perspective on a question can be different, and how a group of people can get heated over an answer.

Jordan Ellenberg discusses the mathematics of high-dimensional shapes and geometries, noting that while he sees himself as very different from traditional researchers, his work is creating something new and powerful. He discusses the potential for computers to compete in the field of mathematics as well, pointing out that there is already a market for specialized computer algebra programs.

01:05:00
Jordan Ellenberg discusses the mathematics of high-dimensional shapes and geometries, and how difficult it can be to determine whether a knot is slice. Lisa Picarillo solved the problem a few years ago, and the journey to find the proof was difficult but ultimately rewarding. Ellenberg argues that mathematics should be beautiful and simple, and that the human story of perseverance and struggle is the interesting part of mathematics.

01:10:00
Jordan Ellenberg discusses the mathematics of high-dimensional shapes and geometries, explaining that Fermat's last theorem is not as simple as it could be and that it was difficult for mathematicians to prove it. He also discusses the development of number theory over time and the importance of the Fermat problem. Finally, he mentions that Andrew Wiles was the first to prove the theorem.

Jordan Ellenberg discusses the mathematics of high-dimensional shapes and geometries, highlighting the importance of deformation theory in proving the concept of unique factorization. He also discusses the concept of distance and how it is not pre-determined by humans.

01:20:00
In this video, Jordan Ellenberg discusses the mathematics of high-dimensional shapes and geometries. He talks about the periodic distance, which is a crazy distance, and how it is important for autocomplete and machine translation. He also talks about how close two numbers need to be in order for them to be considered close. He says that two to a large power is a multiplication very small number, and two to a negative power is a very big number. He explains that binary numbers are written backwards, and that this is a good metaphor for how close two numbers need to be in order to be considered close. He says that the goal of mathematics is to help humans understand things, and that proving new theorems is one way to test that. He says that the benchmark for proving something is that it is a new theorem, but that the goal is to understand the problem rather than to know whether it is true or false.

01:25:00
Jordan Ellenberg discusses the mathematics of high-dimensional shapes and geometries. He argues that in order to understand something, we need to be able to explain it simply. He goes on to say that real things are not always simple, and that in order to understand something, we need to start with a complex idea and simplify it.

01:30:00
Jordan Ellenberg discusses the mathematics of high-dimensional shapes and geometries, and how they can be difficult to understand. He also talks about prime numbers and how they are a central part of mathematics, and how they can be difficult to define. He concludes the talk with a discussion of prime gaps and bounded gaps, and how they are important for the future of mathematics.

01:40:00
Jordan Ellenberg discusses mathematics of high-dimensional shapes and geometries with Lex Fridman. He talks about the pseudo prime numbers and the twin prime conjecture, which states that on average, prime numbers get farther and farther apart. He explains that it is not random, but deterministic, and that it is phenomenally useful to think of prime numbers as randomly distributed.

Jordan Ellenberg discusses mathematics of high-dimensional shapes and geometries, with a focus on the history of infinity and the implications of computational thinking. He comments on the modern trend of treating infinity as a less-rigorous concept, and cites examples of where infinity is used in computer science and engineering.

01:55:00
Jordan Ellenberg discusses the work of mathematician John Conway and talks about his own experiences as a mathematician growing up in the Soviet Union. Conway was known for his playful nature and for his mathematical analyses of games.

02:00:00
According to the video, Jordan Ellenberg was a mathematician who worked on high-dimensional shapes and geometries. His research overlapped in some ways with Lex Fridman's, and Fridman would often ask Ellenberg questions in the common room. Ellenberg's responses were so rich and went so many places that they taught him a great deal about mathematics and life in general. Ellenberg's loss is a huge loss to the field of mathematics, and his game of life (a simple algorithm for playing a game with marking squares on a piece of paper) is a wonderful laboratory for exploring complex systems.

02:05:00
Jordan Ellenberg discusses the mathematics of high-dimensional shapes and geometries, pointing out that there are an infinite number of symmetries of a given object. He also mentions group theory, which is the study of the general abstract world that encompasses all these kinds of things.

He also comments on the turning down of a Fields Medal, citing the principle at hand as something against which he must stand.

02:25:00
Jordan Ellenberg discusses the idea of the mathematical Olympiad, how it is not actually a competition where winners receive awards, and how one can integrate mathematical thinking into one's life in a way that is personal to them.

02:30:00
Jordan Ellenberg discusses how he approaches difficult mathematics problems by "falling in love with the process of doing something hard" and enjoying the "enjoying the suffering of it" despite not always understanding the details. He also cites the example of Navy SEAL David Goggins, who has completed many ultra-marathons despite enduring many difficult moments along the way.

02:35:00
Jordan Ellenberg discusses how mathematics underlies the way humans think, and how it can be used to explore the mind. He also discusses how beliefs in God can be based on a person's own experiences, rather than being based on mathematical arguments.

02:40:00
Jordan Ellenberg discusses mathematics in a fascinating way, exploring complex ideas while remaining clear and specific. He also shares an interesting analogy involving x-ray specs and the world.
