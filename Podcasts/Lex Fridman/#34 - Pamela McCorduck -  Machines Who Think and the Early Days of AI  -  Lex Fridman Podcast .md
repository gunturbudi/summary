# Summary of Pamela McCorduck: Machines Who Think and the Early Days of AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #34

Pamela McCorduck discusses the early days of artificial intelligence and its potential future impact on society. She argues that there is a tension between wanting a perfect servant and the fear of losing human complexity and mystery.

Pamela McCorduck discusses the early days of artificial intelligence, focusing on the Dartmouth summer workshop in 1956 where the field was launched. She interviews some of the pioneers of AI, including Claude Shannon and Marvin Minsky. McCorduck discusses the importance of the pioneers and their impact on the field.

Pamela McCorduck discusses the early days of artificial intelligence, and how the four founding fathers - Allen Newell, Herbert Simon, Marvin Minsky, and John McCarthy - each contributed to the development of the field. McCorduck also discusses her experience trying to get funding for her research, and how she was able to talk to some of the leading minds in AI at the time.

00:10:00
Pamela McCorduck discusses the early days of artificial intelligence, specifically focusing on the work of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace. She discusses the fear and religious roots behind the development of AI, and points out that there are both positive and negative aspects to the technology.

00:15:00
The main point of this video is that fear of artificial intelligence is based on superficial thinking. Key people in the history of AI have changed over time, and Pam McCorduck interviewed Ed Feigenbaum, one of the founding fathers of AI, about his views on the subject. Feigenbaum believes that artificial intelligence is a boon for human beings and has wonderful fables about how it will benefit humanity.

00:20:00
Pamela McCorduck discusses her experiences working on early AI projects and how the field has evolved over time. She also discusses the challenges of defining AI and its place within computer science.

00:25:00
In the 1980s, Pamela McCorduck, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh, organized monthly meetings with other AI experts to discuss the possibilities of artificial intelligence. McCorduck was skeptical about the potential success of the AI project, but she enjoyed the discussions and the friendship that developed among the participants. Many of the ideas that became reality in the 1980s, such as deep learning and artificial intelligence applications, were initially dismissed as unrealistic by McCorduck.

00:30:00
Pamela McCorduck discusses the early days of AI and the possibility of a "AI winter." She argues that this is a crock winter because basic research is important, but it can't be monetized. Great Britain's Whitehill report is a good example of this.

00:35:00
Pamela McCorduck discusses her book, " Machines Who Think ," and how it reflects her own journey as an AI scientist. She also discusses how the field of AI has evolved over the years, and how the work of Harold Cohen, a painter, has been influential in the development of AI.

00:40:00
Pamela McCorduck discusses her book " Machines Who Think ," which discusses the early days of artificial intelligence. McCorduck discusses her excitement for the field of artificial intelligence and her admiration for the audacity of the ideas of its pioneers. She notes that the spirit of the people working in AI is the same as it was in the early days, and that the field is still full of excitement and potential for change.

00:45:00
In this video, Pamela McCorduck discusses the idea of a "singularity," or a moment when machines become smarter than humans. She notes that the singularity is not a "great eatable crossroads" where machines meet and humans become extinct, but rather a point where machines are already doing better than humans in many areas. She also discusses the idea of a "geriatric robot," which would be a machine that helps elderly people with day-to-day tasks and is able to listen and understand them.

00:50:00
Pamela McCorduck discusses the early days of artificial intelligence and the challenges involved in creating machines that are as intelligent as humans. She argues that there is a tension between wanting a perfect servant and the fear of losing human complexity and mystery. She feels that AI can help to alleviate loneliness and connect people in a deeper way.

00:55:00
Pamela McCorduck discusses her book "What You're Really Looking At: Four Possible Futures for Women in Tech," in which she looks at the various aspects of the present and how they might change in the future. She discusses the sand pile effect, which she uses to illustrate her point that the future is both forward and backward-looking. She is optimistic about the future, believing that there is still much progress to be made in terms of gender equality.
