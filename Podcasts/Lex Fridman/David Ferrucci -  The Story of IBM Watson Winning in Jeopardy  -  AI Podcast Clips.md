David Ferrucci, a senior leader in IBM Research, argued that Watson could compete in the Jeopardy! game in 2004. After convincing others of the feasibility of the project, Ferrucci began to experiment with the software. He knew a lot about how IBM's open domain question answering software worked and was confident that Watson could compete. However, the project was met with skepticism from the rest of the team and management. Watson competed in the Jeopardy! game in 2005 and 2006, but ultimately failed.

In this video, IBM Watson's creator, David Ferrucci, shares his thoughts on how the project succeeded. Ferrucci argues that the project was difficult, but possible, and shows examples of where Watson succeeded and failed. He also talks about why the project was initially rejected, and how he was able to convince the executives to fund the project.

David Ferrucci discusses how IBM Watson won in Jeopardy using a combination of web search, semantic analysis, and statistical analysis. Watson was able to quickly identify the right answer to a question, and had to do so quickly enough to be considered a winner.

00:20:00
David Ferrucci describes how IBM Watson won in Jeopardy by using a combination of question analysis and search engines that produced multiple candidate answers. Each candidate answer was scored and ranked, and the most likely correct answer was chosen. This process required a lot of research and development, and the team still has to work on speeding up the algorithm and improving accuracy.
