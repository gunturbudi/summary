It cites uses for animals that robots cannot do, such as dolphins' abilities to sense underwater, and discusses how humans are gradually adapting to incorporating robots into their daily lives. The author argues that while animals and robots are different, they share many similar capabilities, and that using animals as analogies is a helpful way to think about robots.

01:10:00
Kate Darling discusses the similarities between dogs and social robots, and how the former can serve as companions or emotional tools for humans. She also points out that there is room for both in the human psyche, as some people enjoy dogs for their oddness and others appreciate robots for their ability to replicate human emotions.

01:15:00
The video discusses the potential ethical implications of social robots, and argues that companies that create these robots will need to be especially careful about the way they personalize these machines in order to avoid angering their users.

01:20:00
Kate Darling discusses her concerns over social robots that are able to personalize themselves based on data they collected from users. She believes that this technology will be abused if not properly regulated, and that users should own all the data collected about them and be able to delete it with a single click.

01:25:00
Kate Darling, a social robot and ethics researcher at MIT, discusses the potential implications of social robots on privacy and the future of technology. She notes that, while social robots can be a source of comfort and support, it is important to be aware of the possible implications of using them, such as the development of personal relationships with bots that could be used to market products to consumers.

01:30:00
The television advertisement is trying to market the product to the viewer, but it offers some transparency by explaining that age children are more likely to like a policy that allows social robots to market to people through casual conversation. The majority of the children interviewed said they preferred this type of policy. Daniela de Paola Anastasia and Lex Fridman discuss the business model for a social robot that is controlled by the company, but not influenced by promoted ads. They believe that the robot will eventually become valuable to people even if it has no function other than marketing and helping with preferences. The concept of a social robot as a pet that has no function other than being a member of the family is popular, but companies are not yet taking this route. They hope that this video will help to bring awareness to the idea and motivate companies to develop this technology in a different way.

01:35:00
