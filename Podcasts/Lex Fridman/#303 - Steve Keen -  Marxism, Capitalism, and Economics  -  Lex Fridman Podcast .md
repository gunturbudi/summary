# Summary of Steve Keen: Marxism, Capitalism, and Economics | Lex Fridman Podcast #303

Steve Keen discusses different schools of economics, and describes the Physiocrats as a school that went extinct about 250 years ago. They believed that the economy was a system of fluids that operated in a similar way to the body, and that wealth came from agricultural production.
In this video, economist Steve Keen discusses the history of economics, classical and neoclassical schools, and the role of money in economics. He explains that, in classical and neoclassical economics, value is determined by the amount of effort put in, and that capitalism equilibrates marginal cost and marginal utility.
Steve Keen believes that money is essential for the economy, and that it creates demand. He also believes that the neoclassical school of thought is incorrect, and that the real nature of capitalism is instability and creative violence.
Steve Keen discusses the differences between Marxism and capitalism, and how China's more likely to survive as a society going into the future due to its reliance on capitalism with a socialist command political system.
In this video, economist Steve Keen discusses the Marxist theory of economic cycles, with particular reference to Richard Goodwin's model of cycles. Keen notes that, while Goodwin's model is mathematically complex, it nonetheless accurately predicts the patterns of economic activity seen in reality. He also discusses how cycles diminish as private debt levels increase, and points to the 2007-08 financial crisis as an example of why economists need to be aware of the chaotic dynamics of economics.
Steve Keen discusses Marxism, capitalism, and economics with Lex Fridman. He explains how capitalism and Marxism both have their own negative feedback loops that can lead to a collapse. He suggests that the government run a deficit to maintain a mixed fiat credit economy and reduce the effects on the poor.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Steve Keen discusses the real foundation of Marx's political philosophy, the economic argument that there would be a tendency for the rate of profit to fall and that tendency would lead to capitalists battening down on workers harder paying them less than their subsistence. He also discusses how socialism would have to come about if this happened, citing Marx's own vision of the revolution in England. Finally, Keen discusses the importance of economics in terms of human civilization and how it might be able to help bring about its termination.

The video discusses different schools of economics, and describes the Physiocrats as a school that went extinct about 250 years ago. They believed that the economy was a system of fluids that operated in a similar way to the body, and that wealth came from agricultural production.

00:10:00
In this video, economist Steve Keen discusses the history of economics, classical and neoclassical schools, and the role of money in economics. He explains that, in classical and neoclassical economics, value is determined by the amount of effort put in, and that capitalism equilibrates marginal cost and marginal utility.

00:15:00
Steve Keen believes that money is essential for the economy, and that it creates demand. He also believes that the neoclassical school of thought is incorrect, and that the real nature of capitalism is instability and creative violence.

00:20:00
Sean Peter described modern monetary theory as the study of how money works and how it is created. Modern monetary theory is based on the idea that money is a creature of accounting and not a commodity.

00:25:00
In this video, Steve Keen discusses the concept of money creation, and how it is a good thing because it allows for commerce to happen. He also discusses the concept of money being the sum total of all assets and liabilities, and how this is another mind-blowing thing that he recently solved himself.

00:30:00
Steve Keen discusses the ideas of Karl Marx, discussing how he saw the world and why he is a powerful thinker. He also discusses the origins of Marx's ideas, explaining that he was not directly taught by Hegel, but was influenced by him.

00:35:00
This transcript excerpt from a YouTube video by Steve Keen explains how his ideas on economics developed, from his early beliefs in mainstream economics to his later criticism of mainstream economics. Keen argues that, in Marx's view, labour is the only source of value, and that the focus on human beings in capitalism results in a tension between the foreground and background aspects of society.

00:40:00
In this video, Steve Keen discusses how Marxism views the unity of humans and commodities in a capitalist economy. He also discusses the neoclassical theory, which states that the price of a commodity is determined by the marginal utility and marginal cost of that commodity. Keen points out that this theory is outdated, as it is based on a previous, pre-capitalist society. Instead, in a capitalist society, the price of a commodity is determined by its use value (its utility for humans) and its exchange value (its price on the market).

00:45:00
In this video, Steve Keen discusses Marx's theory of capitalism and how it differs from the neoclassical model. He points out that, in a capitalist economy, commodities have two different values-exchange value and use value-which are determined by their cost of production. Profit comes from the difference between these two values.

00:50:00
Steve Keen discusses the labor theory of value, which is a theory developed by Karl Marx that states that the value of a commodity is based on the amount of labor that has gone into producing it. Marx also argued that machines can also bring value to the world, and that the value of a machine is based on the amount of labor that has gone into producing it.

00:55:00
Steve Keen discusses how Marx's ideas on use value and exchange value can be applied to machines, and how this led to his analysis of capitalism. He also discusses his failed master's thesis on the same topic, and how he met Jeff Fishburn, who helped him understand Marx's work better.

01:00:00
In his notes, Marx discovered that labor, rather than being the only source of value, contributes more to production than its depreciation. This insight undermined his explanation of the cost of production exceeding depreciation as the source of profit.

01:05:00
In this video, Steve Keen talks about contradictions in Marx's own thought. He says that no matter how useful a machine is, it cannot add more to production than 150 pounds. However, in his old exclusivist logic, he could justify this. But in his modern argument, this contradicts his previous logic. Keen explains that the difference between Marxian economics and Marxist political ideology is the gap between the two. Differences include the overlap of differences, and the differences in the real foundation of Marx's political philosophy.

01:10:00
Steve Keen argues that socialism is doomed to failure because it relies on a transitional period of capitalism. His analysis is based on the assumption that there is a significant difference between the mensheviks and bolsheviks on the issue of transitioning to socialism.

01:15:00
According to Steve Keen, the Soviet Union failed to transition to a market-based economy because they lacked the innovation to compete. In order to create innovation, capitalism requires a large pool of unemployed workers.

01:20:00
In this video, Steve Keen discusses Marx's vision of a socialist utopia, in which capitalism must be exhaustively explored before reaching a utopia in which everyone has the same standard of living. He also talks about how scarcity under capitalism is actually determined by non-reproducible products, and how capitalism will eventually be forced to compromise with the environment in order to sustain itself.

01:25:00
Steve Keen discusses why socialism failed and how the ideas of Karl Marx led to Stalinism. He also stresses the importance of communication and debate in order to avoid ideological obstructionism.

01:30:00
Steve Keen discusses the difference between capitalism and socialism, and how capitalism is ultimately more productive than socialism due to the way that competition drives innovation. He also touches on the issue of accent and how it can determine a person's view on a certain topic.

01:35:00
In this video, economist Steve Keen discusses the differences between capitalism and socialism, and how they result in different types of dictatorships. He also touches on the effects of central economic control on societies.

01:40:00
In this video, economist Steve Keen discusses how Marxism and capitalism differ, and how China's more likely to survive as a society going into the future due to its reliance on capitalism with a socialist command political system.

01:45:00
According to a news report, China's output of light industry had grown by 17 in the previous year, but its output of heavy industry had fallen by seven percent. In response, the Chinese Communist Party sent out a directive to promote light industry. This led to the stripping of heavy industry factories and the development of light industry. However, this process destroyed all of the heavy industry, and left China with little ability to industrialize. In addition, the Chinese people were happy due to their access to enough food, but they did not want to get divorced from the state because the boundaries between "acceptable" and "unacceptable" behavior were wide.

01:50:00
In this video, Steve Keen discusses the different ways in which different systems of government can affect the economy and how, in his opinion, China's model of socialism is more successful in controlling human consumption levels than a democracy.

01:55:00
In his Lex Fridman podcast, economist Steve Keen criticizes the economics community for focusing on short-term economic consequences of climate change when the true cost of inaction is much greater. Keen suggests that centralized planning might be a more effective way to deal with global catastrophic events.

02:00:00
Steve Keen argues that economists have made up their own numbers to say that changes to the climate are trivial. He also argues that climate change means changes to the weather patterns of the planet, which could lead to the destruction of human civilizations.

02:05:00
Economist Richard Told argues that, if the Gulf Stream were to disappear, global GDP would increase by 1.1%. However, his model, which ignores precipitation, is flawed. Other economists, including those who study climate change, are very confident about the complex system of labor, money, and capital. Therefore, if someone trusts the opinions of these experts, they should also trust that we will be able to deal with any future crises.

02:10:00
Steve Keen critiques the economist's reliance on models that are inaccurate and outdated. He suggests that instead of looking at individual models, scientists should focus on the consequences of climate change.

02:15:00
In this video, economist Steve Keen discusses how models used to predict the weather are becoming more complex, and how this could lead to destruction of society and the food production industry. He also points out the arrogance of those who make apocalyptic predictions about the future of the Earth without taking into account the fragility of the system.

02:20:00
Steve Keen argues that the current capitalist system is unsustainable and that Marxism could be a more successful model. He also discusses the value of life and the need for humans to live in harmony with the biosphere.

02:25:00
In his new book, "Humble Naval: A Manifesto for an Unseen Future", Steve Keen argues that society should focus on developing technology that can help off-load the productive side of the economy to other planets, in order to mitigate the catastrophic effects of climate change.

02:30:00
Steve Keen's book, "The Economics of Chaos," discusses the process of economics and introduces the concepts of system dynamics. The book also discusses the effects of capital and alpha on employment, wages, and profit.

02:35:00
In this video, economist Steve Keen discusses the Marxist theory of economic cycles, with particular reference to Richard Goodwin's model of cycles. Keen notes that, while Goodwin's model is mathematically complex, it nonetheless accurately predicts the patterns of economic activity seen in reality.

02:40:00
Steve Keen discusses how cycles diminish as private debt levels increase, and points to the 2007-08 financial crisis as an example of why economists need to be aware of the chaotic dynamics of economics.

02:45:00
Steve Keen discusses how the neoclassicals' model of the banking system ignores how credit can be a component of aggregate demand and be very volatile. He shows how this is reflected in American history, with no period of negative credit until 2007.

02:50:00
In this video, Steve Keen discusses the functions of money, the contradictory nature of money's role as a store of value and means of exchange, and the dangers of hyperinflation. He also discusses the Austrian school of economics' theory of money, which argues that money should depreciate in order to stimulate economic activity.

02:55:00
In this video, economist Steve Keen discusses how too much private debt can lead to a debt deflation, which can lead to financial crisis.

03:00:00
Steve Keen explains how capitalism and Marxism both have their own negative feedback loops that can lead to a collapse. He suggests that the government run a deficit to maintain a mixed fiat credit economy and reduce the effects on the poor.

03:05:00
In this YouTube video, economist and critic of capitalism, Steve Keen, discusses how the collective intelligence of humans can lead to both the destruction of ecosystems and the stupidity of individuals. He believes that humanity is on a trajectory to reach a point where its beliefs will limit its destructive capacities.

03:10:00
Steve Keen discusses the benefits and drawbacks of capitalism and socialism with Lex Fridman. He also discusses his thoughts on the potential for machines to become conscious and have feelings.

03:15:00
Steve Keen discusses how capitalism and Marxism are related to economics, and how a career in economics is not advisable. He recommends learning system dynamics and then applying it to economics if that's what interests you.

03:20:00
Steve Keen discusses how the economics of climate change journal of economic perspectives article he read assumed that the relationship between GDP and temperature over space would apply over time. His wife's thai background and comments about climate change broke him out of depression. He discusses his default position being with scientists, but also points out that nature is allowed to be arrogant because it does not need it. He asks the audience about their love lives and how they think love plays into the larger picture.

03:25:00
Steve Keen discusses the role of love in the human condition, highlighting the importance of transferring love to other species. He also shares his thoughts on death, asserting that individuals may be afraid of it but that living on as a species depends on the collective consciousness of humanity.

03:30:00
Steve Keen discusses Marxism, capitalism, and economics with Lex Fridman. Keen stresses the importance of grasping things at their root, citing Karl Marx as an example. Keen thanks listeners for supporting his podcast and encourages them to check out the sponsors.
