Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Stuart Russell discusses the long-term future of artificial intelligence with Lex Friedman. He shares how he created a chess playing program in high school that never beat him, and how Alphago and Alpha Zero are similar in their approach to learning.

00:05:00
Stuart Russell discusses the long-term future of artificial intelligence and how alphago's ability to quickly evaluate positions allows it to outperform humans. He explains that although alphago is filled with uncertainty at early stages of its search, thinking about a less promising option can lead to a better decision in the real world.

00:10:00
Stuart Russell discusses the long-term future of artificial intelligence, emphasizing the potential for machines to become smarter than humans and conquer various fields.

00:15:00
Stuart Russell discusses the long-term future of artificial intelligence, noting that progress occurs by gradually removing assumptions that make problems easy to solve. He explains that while Alphago may not be as impressive as some other AI systems, it is still a step in the right direction.

00:20:00
Stuart Russell advocates for caution in artificial intelligence development as the technology is still in its early stages and has had disappointments in the past.

00:25:00
Stuart Russell discusses the long-term future of artificial intelligence and how it will need a different decision-making architecture than either rule-based or neural network systems. He also talks about the dangers of not being able to cope with unforeseen situations.

00:30:00
Stuart Russell discusses the long-term future of artificial intelligence, highlighting the need for careful planning and philosophical understanding of the technology. He discusses the importance of tension and fear in the creation of AI systems, and the potential for unintended consequences of such a powerful technology.

00:35:00
Stuart Russell discusses the long-term future of artificial intelligence, discussing concerns about how things might go wrong. He discusses how he thinks about AI safety, thoughts on the King Midas problem, and how humans may be able to manage losing control of machines if they become too intelligent.

00:40:00
Stuart Russell discusses the long-term future of artificial intelligence, noting that if we want to ensure that machines do what we want them to, we need to teach them humility. He argues that this is a different kind of AI, one where machines are uncertain about what we want them to do and defer to us accordingly.

00:45:00
Stuart Russell discusses the long-term future of artificial intelligence, and how humans must be willing to come to terms with the fact that they may be wrong about some objectives. He also discusses the parallels between utilitarianism and argumentation, and how we use them to make decisions.

00:50:00
The speaker discusses the long-term future of artificial intelligence and its potential risks. He notes that both utilitarianism and the repugnant conclusion, which suggest that we should maximize pleasure, have similar arguments. He argues that, if we get the formula for AI wrong, we could have disastrous consequences. He suggests that we need a safe and sustainable AI system in order to avoid this.

00:55:00
Stuart Russell argues that there is currently no oversight of algorithms with potentially profound effects on society, and that it will take time to develop such standards. He also points out that impersonation of humans is not a good idea, and that there are many factors we need to consider when discussing AI.

01:00:00
Stuart Russell discusses the long-term future of artificial intelligence and how regulation may be necessary to protect society from unforeseen damage. He also discusses the potential for nuclear weapons and the role of physics in their development.

01:05:00
Stuart Russell, a computer scientist and nuclear physicist, discusses the parallels between nuclear weapons and artificial intelligence. He believes that most researchers are not concerned about artificial intelligence because they do not understand the potential risks, and that we need to be more candid about the risks.

01:10:00
Stuart Russell notes that people are worrying about artificial intelligence going wrong, but without a good understanding of what could go wrong, it's hard to make a sensible plan. He also points out that if AI does go wrong, it may be difficult for humans to stop it - meaning we may end up in a similar situation to the gorillas, who have lost control of their population due to the development of smarter beings.

01:15:00
Stuart Russell discusses the long-term future of artificial intelligence, noting that there are four major failure modes that could lead to our civilization being taken over by machines. He also discusses the importance of teaching people about AI safety so that they have the incentive to keep it in the hands of humans.

01:20:00
Stuart Russell discusses the long-term future of artificial intelligence, noting that there are still many unanswered questions about how these technologies will impact society. He encourages people to be concerned about the potential for AI systems to go wrong, and recommends reading the 1909 science fiction story "The Machine Stops."

01:25:00
Stuart Russell discusses the long-term future of artificial intelligence, explaining that while theoretical entities like AI will be proven beneficial, real-world frameworks may not match. He also mentions his favorite sci-fi movie about AI, Interstellar.
