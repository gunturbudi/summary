Robert Langer has an h-index of 269 and has published over two hundred ninety five thousand papers, making him one of the most prolific scientists in history. He discusses the importance of failure and how it has helped him in his career. He also advises students to pursue ideas that have a large potential impact rather than those with a narrow scope.

00:10:00
Robert Langer discusses how difficult it is to control aspects of the human body, citing the blood vessel as an example. He goes on to explain how pharmaceutical drugs are discovered and developed.

00:15:00
Robert Langer discusses the history of angiogenesis inhibitors, including how he and his team isolated the first polymer molecules that could inhibit blood vessel growth. After years of experimentation,Avastin was approved by the FDA in 2004.

00:20:00
Robert Langer discusses the discovery process for drugs, discussing how serendipitous discovery and art are mixed together in the process. He also discusses the challenges of drug delivery and how smart drug delivery systems could be developed in the future.
