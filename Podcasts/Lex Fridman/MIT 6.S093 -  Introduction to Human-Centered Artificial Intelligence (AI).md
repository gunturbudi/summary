Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
This lecture is about the future of human-centered artificial intelligence, which is based on the idea that learning-based methods will continue to dominate real-world applications. Machine learning and machine teaching are the main focuses of the community, and human supervision will be necessary to ensure safety and fairness.

In this video, Professor David Silver and his team discuss deep learning, which is a type of artificial intelligence that is based on the assumption that a machine can learn to do tasks better than a human can. They explain that in the training phase, the machine takes data from the humans and uses that data to train a machine learning model. In the operation phase, the machine relies on the annotations provided by humans to make decisions.

This video provides an introduction to the field of human-centered artificial intelligence (AI), which is focused on minimizing the amount of data that needs to be annotated in order to provide a human-facing service. The field is divided into two parts: the methods portion, which focuses on reducing the amount of data necessary for a machine to learn, and the interactive element, which focuses on the human-machine interaction required to provide a rich, meaningful experience to the user. Safety is a major concern in the field, as is the need to ensure that the AI system is safe to use in the real world.

The gray area, the line we all walk as a society in the crowd intelligence is the area of human-centered artificial intelligence. As humans, we need to provide bounds on AI systems in order to ensure that they do not result in things such as discrimination, ethical considerations, or catastrophic damage to our safety. The near-term directions of research for machine teaching involve improving supervised learning, integrating a human into the annotation process, and transforming the way we do annotations- so that the process of annotation is not defining the data set and then going through the entire data set, but is instead a machine teaching system that queries the user for questions to annotate. On the algorithm side, active learning is actively selecting during the training process which part of the data to train on and annotate, data augmentation is taking things that have been supervised by a human and expanding them, modifying the data, and self-play is in the reinforcement learning area where the system constructs a model of the world and goes along alone in a room and plays with that model to try to figure out the different constraints with the model. Another challenge that we as humans need to solve in order to achieve human-centered artificial intelligence is achieving .3% error on the handwritten recognition task, which is

The video discusses the importance of human-centered artificial intelligence, and explains how a human-centered AI system must be able to perceive and understand the state of a human being at the simplest level in order to work effectively with them. Near-term research directions involve deep learning techniques that will allow an AI system to automatically recognize physical, mental, and social states of people.

This video discusses the challenges and opportunities for human-centered artificial intelligence, including emotion recognition, natural language processing, and body pose estimation. It also discusses how these technologies are being developed at MIT.

This video covers the state-of-the-art in human-centered artificial intelligence, with a focus on face recognition and other perception tasks. It covers the motivation for the research, its early progress, and the current and future challenges.

00:35:00
Face recognition is the ability to identify a face from a photograph or video. This is a difficult task as faces can look very similar to each other. There is also variation in faces due to hairstyles, weight, and makeup. Accurately recognizing a face is important for security applications, such as unlocking a phone or authorizing payments. There is potential for dystopian outcomes if individuals are unable to protect their privacy.

00:40:00
The recent breakthroughs in human-centered artificial intelligence (AI) began with the development of DeepFace, a technique that uses deep neural networks to improve face recognition performance. In 2017, a public data set with 672,000 identities and 4.7 million photos was released, which has led to further breakthroughs in face recognition. Future work in this field will focus on incorporating more cue information beyond the frontal view of the face, and understanding why incorrect decisions are made in face recognition systems.

This video discusses the importance of human-centered artificial intelligence (AI), covering topics such as activity recognition, privacy, and future impact. Two recent breakthroughs are discussed, deep learning and C3D, which are used to train more accurate action recognition systems. The video briefly covers localization of activity in video.

The video discusses the development of human-centered artificial intelligence, which involves the recognition of human activity, including posture and movement. It explores the challenges posed by this type of AI, and discusses how deep learning can successfully address these challenges.

This video discusses the research done at MIT in the fields of human-centered artificial intelligence (AI) and artificial general intelligence (AGI). The main points discussed are:
-Pose detection is a key area of research in human-centered AI, as it allows AI systems to understand human behavior in a more holistic way.
-Past work has been done in the area of safety supervision for AI systems, using arguing machines to detect when human supervision is needed.
-Another area of research is adding a vision system to AI systems to give them a sense of uncertainty about their surroundings. This allows for a more reliable human-supervised system.
-One future direction for human-centered AI is to create systems that are aware of the uncertain outcomes of their decisions, allowing for a more robust safety net.
