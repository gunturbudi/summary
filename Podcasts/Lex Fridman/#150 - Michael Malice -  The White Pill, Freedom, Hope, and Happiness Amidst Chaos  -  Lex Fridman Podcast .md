<could not summarize>

01:25:00
Michael Malice's book, "The White Pill, Freedom, Hope, and Happiness Amidst Chaos," is about the systematic oppression of the North Korean people by their family. This oppression has led to a farcical element in their history, in which the leader, Kim Jong-il, is said to be able to multitask and do many things at once. This allows the government to claim that he is still involved in the people, even when he is not. Malice argues that this type of totalitarian structure is flawed, because the only person who can truly be in control is the leader himself, and anyone who is not like him is made to feel useless and incompetent.

Michael Malice discusses the concept of "being verboten um," or being forbidden to speak or think certain thoughts.

Malice goes on to discuss the concept of "racialism," or the belief that there are inherent differences between races. He argues that although racism and sexism are not used to shut down conversation, they are still topics that are difficult to be nuanced about.

02:20:00
Michael Malice discusses the idea of anarchy, or a state of freedom without government, and how it would work in practice. He points to examples of anarchy existing in smaller areas, like within the United States. However, he argues that this is not actually anarchy, as people are still subject to government coercion. Malice suggests that the lack of a government monopoly on violence is what allows for anarchism to exist in practice.

02:25:00
