Oriol Vinyals, a video game developer, discusses the history of video gaming and StarCraft, a real-time strategy gamereleased 20 years ago that changed the way people played online games. He also talks about the importance of the line of video games released over the past 20 years.

00:10:00
Oriol Vinyals, a computer scientist and StarCraft player, discusses his work on AlphaStar, which is a deep reinforcement learning agent that can beat world-class players. He explains how AlphaStar came about and how it succeeded in beating world-class players.

00:15:00
Oriol Vinyals, a deep learning specialist at DeepMind, tells the story of how he and his team developed AlphaStar, a computer program that can learn to play popular video games like StarCraft and Go. AlphaStar was developed in collaboration with Blizzard Entertainment, and Vinyals believes it has the potential to bring competitive gaming to a whole new level.

00:20:00
Oriol Vinyals discusses his work on AlphaStar, StarCraft, and language, and how the game has been balanced over the years by interaction between players and Blizzard.

00:25:00
The video presents Oriol Vinyals' work on DeepMind AlphaStar, StarCraft, and language. AlphaStar is a game AI that learns to improve its performance over time, while StarCraft is a real-time strategy game that can be played using only keyboard and mouse inputs. Vinyals discusses how the game AI learns to play the game, and how the game's state is encoded in a two-dimensional array of pixels.

00:30:00
Oriol Vinyals discusses deep learning architectures for language modeling and machine translation, describing how the same architectures used for these tasks can be used for self-play Atari games. Vinyals also discusses how to imitate human performance using deep learning, and how to use deep learning to train policies for action selection in games.

00:35:00
Oriol Vinyals, a DeepMind mathematician and StarCraft player, discusses how policies designed to replicate human skill in video games can be improved. AlphaStar, the algorithm used by DeepMind to play StarCraft, is only able to achieve a gold level of skill, far below the level of a professional human player.

00:40:00
Oriol Vinyals, head of DeepMind's AlphaStar artificial intelligence program, discusses the challenges of designing computer agents that can match or exceed human skill in video games such as StarCraft. AlphaStar, which DeepMind first unveiled in 2010, can achieve a rate of actions per minute significantly higher than professional human players, but its behavior may not be consistent with human-level performance.

00:45:00
Oriol Vinyals discusses AlphaStar, StarCraft, and how to design AI agents that are more human-like. He also talks about race dynamics and why he chose Protoss.

00:50:00
Oriol Vinyals discusses his work on DeepMind's AlphaStar artificial intelligence, StarCraft, and language. AlphaStar is designed to be able to defeat other AIs in standard game openings, but has to guess what the opponent is doing in order to do so. AlphaStar's belief state becomes very important in these situations, as if the AI knows an opponent is trying to hide something, they may be able to take advantage.

00:55:00
Oriol Vinyals, a researcher at Google's DeepMind, describes DeepMind AlphaStar, a computer program that has defeated top professional gamers at a variety of games. He discusses how AlphaStar is able to do this, and how difficult it is to win against a machine that is skilled at playing the game. He also describes how the AlphaStar League is a way for researchers to test AlphaStar's abilities against other professionals.

01:00:00
Oriol Vinyals, a researcher at Google's DeepMind AI company, discusses his experiences working on the AlphaStar artificial intelligence system, which won a championship in the StarCraft II game in 2018. He says that the moment of AlphaStar's victory was "amazing" and "very motivating," and that the achievement confirms the approach DeepMind is taking with its artificial intelligence research. He also discusses the importance of sharing research with the public in a way that is accessible and engaging.

01:05:00
Oriol Vinyals discusses AlphaStar, StarCraft, and language modeling, and how these advances have led to new applications in other fields. He also talks about the Turing test and how it remains a challenge for artificial intelligence.

01:10:00
Oriol Vinyals discusses the challenges of generalizing deep learning models, and how research is needed to overcome these limitations. He also talks about the success of deep learning models in other domains, and how this can be used to motivate further research in generalization.

01:15:00
Oriol Vinyals discusses his work on deep learning, StarCraft, and language. He discusses how deep learning can be used to solve difficult problems, and how it is related to expert systems and symbolic systems from the 1980s. He also discusses how images and text are related, and how research into sequence to sequence learning may help extend deep learning into other areas.

01:20:00
Oriol Vinyals, a computer scientist at Google DeepMind, discusses his work on deep learning and StarCraft. He explains how deep learning can be used to learn functions that produce any output, and how this approach can be used to translate French to English, caption images, and more. Vinyals also talks about the long-term effects of deep learning, and how he overcame some of the limitations of the technique.

01:25:00
Oriol Vinyals discusses his experience as a researcher and how it has shaped the way he approaches problems. He discusses how he balances optimism and skepticism, and recommends having a team of mentors to help guide your research.
