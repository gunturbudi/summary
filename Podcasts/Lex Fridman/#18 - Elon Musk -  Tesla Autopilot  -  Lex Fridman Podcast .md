# Summary of Elon Musk: Tesla Autopilot | Lex Fridman Podcast #18

In this video, Elon Musk discusses Tesla's Autopilot system and its capabilities. He stresses the importance of redundancy in the system, and how it allows for safe operation even if one of the systems fails. Musk also talks about the importance of having a powerful self-driving computer and how updates to the Autopilot software will be delivered over the air.

The conversation between Elon Musk and Lex Fridman discusses Tesla's Autopilot and its early design choices. Musk emphasises that Autopilot is about the transition to autonomy, and that it is only a question of time before all cars are autonomous. He also explains that the display on the instrument cluster is meant to provide a health check on the vehicle's perception of reality.

Elon Musk discusses Tesla's autonomous driving features and their reliance on large amounts of data. He stresses the importance of redundancy in their systems, and how it allows for safe operation even if one of the systems fails.

00:10:00
Elon Musk discusses how Tesla's Autopilot system can be improved by running full duplicates of the system on each of Tesla's SOCs. Musk also talks about the importance of having a powerful self-driving computer and how updates to the Autopilot software will be delivered over the air.

00:15:00
Elon Musk discusses Tesla's Autopilot and its capabilities, stating that the hardware is ready for increased reliability and regulatory approval. He also predicts that full autonomy will require a human to be supervising the car for at least six months, and that there is a healthy discourse with regulatory bodies on the topic.

In this video, MIT researchers discuss their recent paper on the vigilance of drivers while using Autopilot. In the data they have collected, they found that drivers are maintaining functional vigilance, meaning they are present and looking at the road in order to take over control should something go wrong. This goes against the predictions made by the body of literature on vigilance with automation. However, one of the criticisms of the study is that it is a subset of drivers that may be more vigilant with Autopilot use. Elon Musk responds to the study, saying that he is "optimistic about the pace of improvement" of the system and that "the rate of improvement is exponential." He also says that one of Tesla's design choices was to make Autopilot available to a wider range of drivers, which allows for better reliability.

00:25:00
Elon Musk discusses the design decisions behind Tesla's philosophy of "wide open" autopilot, which he believes is a benefit because it allows drivers to explore the capabilities of the system more fully and understand the limitations. He also notes that this is a risk, since hackers can trick the system into performing unexpected actions. Musk believes that current deep learning approaches will eventually lead to general intelligence, but that there are still some key ideas missing for artificial general intelligence that need to be invented.

Elon Musk discusses the possibility of love being real and suggests that AI could be capable of making people fall in love with it. He also discusses the potential for a simulation to correct errors in the real world.
