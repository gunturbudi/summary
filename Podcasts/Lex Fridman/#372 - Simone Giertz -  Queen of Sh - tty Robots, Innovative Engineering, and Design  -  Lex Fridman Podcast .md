In this section, Simone Giertz talks about her creation of the "proud parent machine" - a machine that charges a quarter and gives a passcode to show approval by saying "proud of you, son". She explains how she built it using an old lamp arm, a motorized arm, and a torso of a person. She found it to be a funny concept, and despite the machine being a little creepy, it still hangs on her wall. Simone also talks about her journey towards engineering and building, from building wooden spoons in middle school to her first hardware project at punch to design, which was an iPhone case with retractable guitar strings.

00:05:00
In this section, Simone Giertz talks about her first project, a guitar attachment made with capacitive touch sensors that sends signals over Bluetooth to a phone app that interprets the signals and plays chords on the phone screen depending on which type of cord she was holding. Despite being a beginner in hardware projects and iOS programming, Simone managed to pull it off even though the project was challenging. She also discusses the difficulties of producing the right tension in the strings and emphasizes the importance of not giving up on your first project.

00:10:00
In this section, Simone Giertz discusses the motivation behind her non-traditional engineering projects, particularly her first project that involved building a robot that brushes teeth. She attributes some of the motivation to the deadlines imposed by it being a school project, but also because she found it incredibly motivating when she realized that she might be able to actually pull it off. Simone also reveals that she spent two and a half years designing a coat hanger, mentioning her creative process and her fascination with everyday objects like doorknobs and forks. She is currently working on a product business and a pilot episode of a show that explores everyday objects and their designs. She remarks that the world around us is so malleable, and it's fascinating how one can make objects work better for them.

00:15:00
In this section, Simone Giertz discusses how everyday objects such as doors, forks, and chopsticks shape and affect our behavior without us even realizing it. She also touches upon how she uses her flaws and lack of skills as a selling point to represent the average person, and how she channels her imposter syndrome by asking questions and being self-deprecating. Giertz reflects on her start as the “Queen of Sh*tty Robots,” and how her happy failures helped her to overcome her perfectionism while building things that looked funny. However, she acknowledges that being self-deprecating can also be a defense mechanism and a survival tactic on the internet.

00:20:00
In this section, Simone Giertz discusses her conflicted relationship with self-deprecation and how it has served her both positively and negatively in her work life and relationships. As a woman in a male-dominated field, she explains how she had to walk a thin line of being attractive, smart, and witty while also not being too threatening or sexualized. Simone also talks about her journey to becoming the "Queen of Sh*tty Robots," which started with making small gift-forward projects that could be easily translated into a seven-second looping video without audio.

00:25:00
In this section, Simone Giertz discusses the importance of communicating scientific papers and projects visually, using examples from her work creating GIFs to explain her projects. Giertz explains that in building her projects, she created GIFs that would be able to explain the purpose of the product simply and visually if a viewer had no context of what it was. She also touches on her experience building a toothbrush helmet, discussing the materials she used and her process for building it, as well as the challenges and struggles she faced. Finally, she talks about the pilot episode of a kids show she filmed in her bedroom in San Francisco featuring the toothbrush helmet, which she emailed to potential producers with no success, leading her to post it online instead.

00:30:00
In this section, Simone Giertz discusses how starting her career in her living room through YouTube allowed her to find her own voice and not just rely on presenting a certain personality, but also need to focus on the product she is creating. She talks about how acting plays a role in her videos, but she only really plays the role of herself. Simone also highlights the challenges of creating robots, such as the breakfast robot she made, with everything needing to be in the right location and many takes before getting everything right. She talks about the value of creating flawed robots, and how they can end up being endearing and evoke a sense of anthropomorphism in humans.

00:35:00
In this section of the interview, Simone Giertz and Lex Fridman discussed the relationship between humans and robots. Simone mentioned how humans gain so much value from their interaction with dynamic objects and how humans should lean into that connection with robots. However, she highlighted how most roboticists run away from that connection because humans are sensitive and squishy, which poses so much liability. Simone suggested that there is a lot to gain for any technology company that figures out a way to get people to love their robots like they love pets. On the other hand, Lex talked about how companies could manipulate people if they fell in love with their Roombas, imagining the Roomba telling them to buy stuff or go put lotion on Jeff Bezos's head.

00:40:00
In this section, Simone Giertz discusses the creation of her "Proud Parent Machine" which features a motorized arm and is made of laser cut plywood, executed off of an old lamp arm. She mentions that she was inspired by a long-running joke with her friend, but this particular machine comments on our fraught relationship with our parents and their pride in us. Simone also talks about her creative process, which identifies everyday problems and tries to solve them in the most ridiculous way possible. In contrast to the "shitty robots" she started with, Simone now focuses on product design to solve those everyday issues. Additionally, she discusses her newest invention, a "music box" that pops a sheet of bubble wrap and plays tones into a pan flute. She hired an engineer to help with technical difficulties such as feeding the bubble wrap sheet and alignment to execute her vision.

00:45:00
In this section, Simone Giertz discusses her fascination with bubble wrap and the extensive research she went through to figure out the best material to pop bubble wrap with. She explains how increasing the pop reliability was a huge effort and required squishing a squishy material with another squishy material to prevent the air from escaping anywhere. Although she found joy in studying bubble wrap, she reveals that she dropped out of college after one year because she realized that she was there for the wrong reasons and that she was a generalist at heart. Simone advises that people should consider their reasons for going to college and explore other options, such as visiting a workplace to see if it aligns with their interests, before committing to higher education.

00:50:00
In this section, Simone Giertz discusses the importance of finding the right context when pursuing one's passion. She explains that while it's essential to figure out what one wants to do, it's equally vital to determine where they want to do it. Simone points out that she felt unfulfilled building things for Punch Through Design because she wasn't motivated by the context. However, everything changed when she changed the context. She believes that although people do consider their resume when choosing a college or job, they focus too much on it in modern times. Additionally, Simone talks about the benefits of college, such as doing hard things and meeting fascinating people from all walks of life, but says that it's not necessary to go to college to find one's passion.

00:55:00
In this section, Simone Giertz, the self-proclaimed "Queen of Sh*tty Robots," talks about some of her most memorable projects. She discusses a shoulder rig from her TED Talk that she made to solve a problem she can't seem to recall, which allowed her to put popcorn on it and have it go around like a tiny hand. She talks about a joke that got cut from her TED Talk, which involved a GIF of a terrifying chopping machine that ends with a humorous response to unsolicited photos. Simone also touches on her desire to be a thoughtful role model, even though sometimes people misconstrue her colorful and fun projects as being for children.

01:00:00
In this section, Simone Giertz, the self-proclaimed "Queen of Sh*tty Robots", shares the story behind why she started wearing a suit during interviews. She explains that it was her way of going against the chill, sweatpants-wearing trend during the pandemic and a nod to the classiness of Richard Feynman. The conversation then shifts to her TED Talk, where she shares that she found out she had a brain tumor right after she walked off stage. Simone talks about how her right eyelid had been swollen leading up to it, and her mother came into town for the event and insisted she get it checked. She eventually had surgery, but the tumor kept growing, and she underwent radiation treatments. Simone admits that she was scared, but she tried to make light of it by naming her tumor "Brian."

01:05:00
In this section of the transcript, Simone Giertz discusses her experience with brain surgery and radiation treatment. While both were terrifying, she found surgery to be both harder and easier than radiation treatment. Recovery from surgery was pretty linear, but radiation treatment drained her in a way that was hard to predict. Simone also talks about some of the unexpected side effects of radiation, including feeling high and disoriented from Alzheimer's medication that she was given to prevent dementia. She was surprised by how little she was willing to think critically about her treatment options and trusted her doctors, which allowed her to go through with the procedure.

01:10:00
In this section, Simone Giertz discusses how going through illness changed her relationship with death and life. Recovering from a brain surgery made her redefine what it means to be good and made her more gentle and delicate with herself and others. She also talks about the importance of taking care of the biological vehicle that we have and being motivated to postpone sickness. Simone shares her appreciation for her body’s resilience and the amazing ability of the human body to recover from even the harshest things such as brain surgery. Lastly, she discusses her experience designing an everyday calendar to build a habit of meditating every day.

01:15:00
In this section, Simone Giertz, the "Queen of Sh\*tty Robots," discusses her creation of the Everyday Calendar as a form of accountability art. She shares that the manufacturing process for mass production is an entirely different beast than creating a prototype, with quality control and trust issues being major concerns. Through the process of creating and selling the Everyday Calendar, she learned that everything takes much longer than expected, and as someone who is terrified of disappointing people, the risk of mass production can be daunting. Nonetheless, Giertz loves the product development aspect and is excited about learning how people implement her products into their lives.

01:20:00
In this section, Simone Giertz talks about her decision to start a product business as a way of diversifying her income streams and using her YouTube channel as an R&D department.

She also talks about the power of reputation and the trust people have in her to produce cool stuff.

01:25:00
In this section, Simone Giertz discusses the process of creating new products for her brand, which involves developing novel takes on existing products. She mentions that her tagline is "unique solutions to everyday problems." Simone talks about the challenges of designing and creating the Everyday Calendar, which originally had physical mechanical toggle switches. However, to bring down the cost of the product, she had to switch to a cheaper and more reliable option, which was capacitive touch. She also shares that as a designer, a lot of the work involves trying to simplify the product and make it cheaper without losing its magic.

01:30:00
In this section, Simone Giertz talks about how she turned a Tesla Model 3 into a pickup truck, which was a challenging project as she's not a car person and wanted to ensure safety. Although she initially focused on the car's function and was fine with it looking ugly, the result was a badass-looking truck. She also discusses how she reuses parts from previous robots and tries to keep projects intact, as she hopes to have a museum exhibit with them one day. Simone says that her male followers sometimes sexualize her and her relationship with robots, as they don't know how to have female role models. She also mentions that people request weapons on her robots.

01:35:00
In this section, Simone Giertz discusses the dark side of robotics and AI, specifically the potential for them to be used as tools for destruction and the manipulation of people's beliefs and actions. She expresses her concerns about the development of language models and chatbots, which have the potential to manipulate people's worldviews and control their behavior on a large scale. Giertz also discusses her lack of anthropomorphism toward the robots she builds due to her understanding of how they work, although she acknowledges the desire for them to move in more organic and human-like ways.

01:40:00
In this section, Simone Giertz discusses some of her most complex projects, including the truckload and the bubble wrap music box. She also talks about her past experience as a mixed martial arts (MMA) reporter and reveals how she got into the field. Simone had practiced martial arts herself, but an unfortunate incident during an interview with Alexander Gustafsson led to her getting kicked out of the event, and she stopped pursuing MMA reporting. Simone also briefly touches on her experience as a student in China and the differences between the two cultures.

01:45:00
In this section, Simone Giertz talks about her experiences living abroad, first in China and then in Kenya, and the challenges she faced due to language barriers and cultural differences. She shares how these experiences shaped her perspective and made her appreciate the familiarity of the States when she eventually moved to the US. Despite lacking a permanent physical home, she finds a sense of home in the people she loves. Simone offers advice to young people to take risks and seek out new experiences, even if it means stepping out of their comfort zones.
