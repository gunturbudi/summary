He also suggests that improving early detection would be a powerful way to prevent outbreaks.
In this video, Rob Reid discusses the existential threat of engineered viruses and lab leaks. He believes that the good guys will almost inevitably outsmart and outnumber the bad guys in most sort of smackdowns, but warns that we need to start creating defensive systems to prevail. He also discusses mass shootings, citing the example of Fort Hood where 45,000 trained soldiers were unable to stop two mass shootings in a row.
In this video, Rob Reid discusses the existential threat of engineered viruses and lab leaks. He argues that the music industry could have avoided this by pivoting to a better experience, rather than demand that people want digital music steal it. He suggests that the same thing is happening to cryptocurrency, and that the industry should pivot now before it's doomed.
