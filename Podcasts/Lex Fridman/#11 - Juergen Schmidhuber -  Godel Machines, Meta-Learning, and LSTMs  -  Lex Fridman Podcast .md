Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Jurgen Schmidhuber discusses his work on meta-learning and how it can be used to improve machine learning algorithms. He also discusses how the limits of physics can be overcome through meta-learning.

00:05:00
Juergen Schmidhuber discusses the theory and practice of self-referential machine learning algorithms, which are designed to solve small problems efficiently.

00:10:00
Juergen Schmidhuber discusses his work on Godel machines, meta-learning, and LSTMs. He says that while the theory behind these approaches is interesting, the practical applications at the moment are limited. He believes that a general intelligence system will eventually be created, but this will require more theoretical understanding than we currently have.

00:15:00
Juergen Schmidhuber discusses his idea that intelligence is based on simple algorithms, and that the universe is fundamentally random. He argues that this is the key to creating intelligence, as without randomness we would not be able to understand or control the basic laws of physics.

00:20:00
Juergen Schmidhuber discusses his theory that the universe is compressible to a short program, and argues that it would be much more beautiful than the universe we currently have. Schmidhuber also discusses the importance of randomness and how it is necessary for creativity and discovery.

00:25:00
Juergen Schmidhuber discusses the idea of compression progress in the history of science, and how this can be applied to artificial intelligence. He talks about the work of Kepler, Newton, and Einstein, and how their theories led to further compression of data. He also discusses the importance of intrinsic rewards for deep insight, and how they help to encourage further scientific progress.

00:30:00
Juergen Schmidhuber discusses the idea of power play, which is the attempt to find the simplest unsolvable problem to get stuck in a local minima. Power play is always trying to break its current generalization abilities by coming up with a new problem which is beyond the current horizon.

00:35:00
Juergen Schmidhuber discusses the role of creativity in intelligence and how it can be found in both human and machine solutions to problems. He also discusses the trade-off between creativity and exploitation and how it has evolved over time in society.

00:40:00
Juergen Schmidhuber discusses the importance of creativity in problem-solving, pointing to examples such as machines learning to creatively invent new problems to solve. He observes that consciousness may be a by-product of problem-solving, and suggests that it may be a useful side-effect of greater and greater problem-solving capabilities.

00:45:00
Juergen Schmidhuber discusses the importance of depth in neural networks, and cites the work of his students as examples of deep networks that are successful in solving problems. He also mentions the deep learning algorithm LCM as an example of a network that is beyond the depths of traditional neural networks.

00:50:00
Juergen Schmidhuber discusses the advantages and limitations of learning algorithms called "LSTMs" or " LCSMs." He also talks about how a controller can use a model network to plan future actions more efficiently.

00:55:00
Juergen Schmidhuber discusses the potential impact of reinforcement learning on real world systems, and discusses the various approaches used to achieve this goal. He believes that simulation is the key to success in this field, and that improving the understanding of the world will be a necessary component of future success.

01:00:00
Juergen Schmidhuber discusses his work in artificial intelligence and how logic programming has influenced his research. He also discusses his excitement for the future of artificial intelligence, including the possibility of robots that learn like children and machines that are able to autonomously operate in the real world.

01:05:00
Juergen Schmidhuber discusses the impact of artificial intelligence on jobs and the economy, pointing out that many new, nontraditional jobs have been created in the past. He is optimistic about the future, though he is concerned about the potential for mass unemployment.

01:10:00
Juergen Schmidhuber discusses the future of AI and how it will expand. He notes that while humans may be the last step in the evolution of the universe, artificial general intelligence (AI) systems will likely not want to interact with humans. They will instead compete amongst themselves.

01:15:00
Juergen Schmidhuber discusses the possibility that intelligent civilizations exist in other parts of the universe, and how the large-scale structure of the universe is not homogeneous. He also discusses the possibility that dark matter may be responsible for the existence of visible stars in our own galaxy.
