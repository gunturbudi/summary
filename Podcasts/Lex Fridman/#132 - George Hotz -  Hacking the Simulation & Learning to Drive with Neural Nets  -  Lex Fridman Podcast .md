He also talks about the importance of cryptography and how it can help to maintain defense in the face of offensive technology.

00:05:00
George Hotz discusses his belief that intelligent civilizations have ceased to exist, and that the only evidence we have for their existence is that we have not been able to communicate with them. He suggests that if we could send out probes that travel close to the speed of light, we would be able to detect their presence. He also speculates about the existence of civilizations beyond our own, and suggests that their physics may be fundamentally different from our own.

00:10:00
In this video, George Hotz discusses the possibility of intelligent life existing elsewhere in the universe and the possibility that we may have developed computer programming naturally. He also discusses the possibility of conspiracy theories being created by the government in order to discredit true information.

00:15:00
George Hotz says that there are many similarities between programming languages and natural languages, and that it would be difficult to translate between the two. He also says that it would be difficult to simulate nature on a computer, and that doing so would be expensive and unethical.

George Hotz discusses how humans can hack their own game by choosing objectives that are fun and productive. He also discusses the idea of immortality and how it could be a good objective function.

00:25:00
George Hotz speaks about the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) to reach a point where it can manipulate our universe, and how that could be a bad thing. He also discusses the potential for artificial intelligence to one day allow us to cheat death, and how that could be a good thing.

00:30:00
George Hotz is a computer scientist and hacker who has been working on a theory of everything called geometric community. Lex Fridman interviews him about this, and George explains that he is interested in theories that give him power over the universe. He tells a story of how he helped a company with a technical deadline related to ethereum technologies.

00:35:00
George Hotz describes how he hacked the simulation to learn to drive, and how he created a software sandbox for ethereum contracts that is secure without requiring layer two. He believes that crypto will be very bullish in the long term, and that the nakamoto consensus algorithm is one of the most important innovations of the 21st century.

00:40:00
In this video, George Hotz explains the concept of consensus and how it can be reached using a relatively straightforward algorithm. He then talks about the idea of smart contracts, comparing them to traditional contracts. Hotz says that while he is interested in all cryptocurrencies, he is mainly invested in bitcoin because of its value.

00:45:00
George Hotz discusses the idea that leaders are not necessarily the most competent or superstar individuals, and how we can create systems in which the leaders are the geniuses. He also talks about his experience as a programmer and how it's helpful to have a wide range of knowledge. He suggests that one way to keep learning new things is to systematically explore different areas of interest.

00:50:00
George Hotz discusses his book, " comma Ai: A Novel of Self-Driving Cars." He discusses how he started the company and its mission, and how he's trying to solve self-driving cars. He says that revenue is key for capitalism, and that the company's main product is the comma Two, a piece of hardware that has cameras. He says that in the future, hardware will be more and more like a person, and that this will make the company's mission even more important.

00:55:00
George Hotz discusses the development of Open Pilot, which is a software that helps to control cars. Open Pilot has improved significantly over the past year, allowing for end-to-end driving and the ability to remove lanes from a car's policy.

01:00:00
George Hotz discusses his work on hacking the simulation and learning to drive with neural nets. He says that while you don't need as much data as you do for a Senate study, the task of driving is full of edge cases, so you need to select data wisely. He also talks about Tesla's approach to self-driving cars, which is different than the rest of the self-driving car industry.

01:05:00
The author discusses how he became the best person in the world at cone detection, and how this inspired him to pursue a career in artificial intelligence. He explains that supervised learning is a compelling approach, and that end-to-end learning is the only way to achieve level 5. He discusses how Tesla's data engine approach is fascinating, and how it is more elegant and requires less programmer hours than traditional AI approaches. He admits that Alpha Zero has lost games miserably in the real world, but notes that this is due to its requirement of a simulator.

01:10:00
George Hotz discusses his paper on self-driving cars, which he believes will be looked back as the "canonical paper" of the deep learning era. He describes how self-driving cars will require a transition from human-driven cars to vehicles that are driven by neural networks. He explains that monitoring is already adaptive and that the "driver monitoring policy" is adjusted based on the situation. He predicts that self-driving cars will be available by the 2020s.

01:15:00
George Hotz discusses the psychological and safety implications of autonomous vehicles, and how he thinks Tesla will eventually overcome some of the challenges. He notes that Tesla will likely ship driver monitoring before they ship Level 5, and bets someone $10,000 that he is correct.

01:20:00
George Hotz discusses the challenges of designing driver monitoring systems and the importance of over-the-air updates. He also has some insights into why human faces are more complicated than external environments.

01:35:00
George Hotz talks about his work on neural networks for driving, and how they can be used to detect certain aspects of a driver's attention. He also mentions that psychology is important in designing such systems, as it is difficult to automatically detect all possible attention-related issues.

01:40:00
George Hotz discusses self-supervised learning, how to install a comma in a 2020 Toyota Corolla, and the Tesla Model S' autopilot mode. He also mentions mode confusion, which may occur when the Tesla's autopilot disengages and the driver is not aware. Hotz provides a link to a Discord server where people can discuss and share code for modifying the comma.

01:45:00
George Hotz discusses his company, comma, and their goal of overtaking Tesla's market share in autonomous driving. comma sells hardware that is helpful for autonomous driving, and they have a money-back guarantee. They also have aprices that are only going up.

02:15:00
In this video, George Hotz discusses how he hacked the simulation and learned to drive with neural nets. He says that while he is still optimistic about the possibility of Tesla's autonomous vehicles beating us, there are still advantages we have. He warns against hype turning into delusion, and says that if someone delivers on most of their promises, they should be celebrated.

02:20:00
In this YouTube video, George Hotz discusses how platforms like Twitter and YouTube can be used for good or for bad, and how self-awareness of users is important for a platform to be successful. He also pitches a book idea about perfect programming setups that doesn't rely on specific hardware or software.

02:25:00
George Hotz discusses the productivity of his day-to-day life, mentioning that he is usually able to "find another day like those days" by doing nothing in particular. He also mentions that he took a month-long trip to New York and experienced some "terrible" moments along the way.

02:30:00
George Hotz discusses how he came to realize that computers double in power every 18 months and humans do not, and how this led to his exploration of artificial intelligence and the hutter prize. He notes that the definition of intelligence he created is still useful, even if it is not day-to-day practical.

02:35:00
George Hotz discusses his thoughts on the potential for general intelligence with a singularity, and how he believes autonomous driving will be deeply tied to human experience. He also discusses his vision for the future of AI, noting that driving is not easy, but that solving it could lead to solving general intelligence.
