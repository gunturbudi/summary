00:40:00
John Danaher discusses the importance of trial and error in the development of Jiu Jitsu, Grappling and MMA skills. He talks about how Apple's lead designer, Johnny Ive, is similar to a Jiu Jitsu teacher, in that he is hands-on but does not tell his ideas to Steve Jobs until they have been tested and found to be promising. This process of trial and error is essential to the development of any skill and is often times more difficult than it seems.

00:45:00
John Danaher discusses the difficulty of compromising between two competing theories and how it applies to Jiu Jitsu, grappling, judo, and MMA. He also mentions his experience training at Balance Studios in Philadelphia, where he learned that training with lower-ranked practitioners can be beneficial.

00:50:00
John Danaher discusses the idea that one must learn to divide up their training cycles into non-competition cycles where they're presumably working with people who are slightly lower in leveling themselves and in some cases quite a bit lower than themselves, and competition cycles where they're working with people much closer to their own skill level. He emphasizes the importance of skill development, rather than winning or losing, and talks about how many people have come up to him over the years and told him that they rolled with a high-level black belt and "tap-out'd" him.

01:10:00
In this video, John Danaher discusses the concept of mastery in various combat sports. He says that if you can play a competitive match against someone ranked in the top 25 in your sport and it's a serious international sport, you are considered to have mastered that sport. He also says that if you can go with the number 25 wrestler in the world and give them a hard competitive match in the gym, you may not win it, but you know they had a good workout. He goes on to say that there are numerous examples of people doing far better than that in five years winning medals at world championships and even Olympic games.

01:15:00
John Danaher discusses the importance of training programs in different sports, discussing how Russia's successful wrestling program is due to their small population and different style of wrestling. He also discusses the importance of numbers, and how American dominance in some sports is due to their style of training and the size of their population.

01:20:00
John Danaher, a Brazilian jiu-jitsu and grappling expert, believes that different training programs have different success rates. He also believes that the athlete is the most important part of the equation, and that persistence is the most important virtue.

01:25:00
John Danaher discusses the importance of drilling, emphasizing that any movement in the gym that does not improve the skills or build new skills is a waste of time. He explains that the goal of drilling is to transmit knowledge so that students can build skill. He also emphasizes the importance of progression, saying that drills should be worked gradually towards a goal in order to avoid resistance in competition.

01:30:00
John Danaher discusses the idea that high repetitions against a non-resisting opponent can help to improve one's understanding of how to apply pressure to the human body.

01:40:00
John Danaher discusses why most people believe drilling does not work to improve skill level, and how his leglock system differs from traditional Jiu Jitsu.

01:45:00
The author discusses the first principles of leg locking, which are that most people use too much of their body in grappling, and how this led to a shift in his thinking towards submission over control. He then goes on to talk about the various ashigorami options available to a leg locker, and how advantages and disadvantages can be found in each variation. He explains how the focus on leg entanglement over breaking can help practitioners minimize danger while still gaining advantageous positions.

01:50:00
John Danaher discusses the concept of hierarchies in grappling, Judo, and MMA, and how to use them to your advantage. He also discusses the importance of having a team of athletes who can do the same thing, and the unique body types that make them good at leglocking.

01:55:00
John Danaher discusses the five-year program that helped him achieve success in Jiu Jitsu, grappling, Judo, and MMA. He credits his early students, Gary Tone, Eddie Cummings, and Nikki Ryan, for their contribution to his success. He explains that the most powerful developments are typically at the onset of a project, and that the advancement of jet engine technology during World War II is an example of this.

02:00:00
John Danaher discusses the progress of modern development, highlighting how the speed of progress between different fields is not always meteoric, but instead tends to be incremental. He discusses the example of Elon Musk and his work in space technology, highlighting how there has been little new development in terms of propulsion technology in the past decade. He then poses the question of whether or not there is another jump in the leg locking system that is yet to be realized, and argues that while there may be some advances in this field, the majority of progress is still incremental.

02:05:00

02:15:00
John Danaher discusses the mindset that led to his mastery of jiu-jitsu, grappling, judo, and MMA. He emphasizes the importance of taking risks for a victory, and recommends a mindset of "unexceptionalism."

02:20:00
John Danaher discusses how to approach competition, noting that it is not your everyday grappling session and that you know you train 300 times for every time you compete. He goes on to say that, for him, competition is something exceptional that is different, scarier, and more nerve-wracking than training. He shares how his reputation is on the line and how he approaches competition by focusing on his techniques, mind, and approach. George St. Pierre is also discussed, with Danaher noting that he started mixed martial arts at a time when the sport was in its infancy and it was very much in its early stages of development. He also speaks highly of St. Pierre and credits him for his professional approach to the sport.

02:25:00
John Danaher discusses the importance of discipline and training in order to be successful in any field, and how George Geale's fear of failure helped him become one of the greatest mixed martial artists of all time.

02:30:00
John Danaher discusses the importance of excelling at just one area of martial arts in order to be successful. He gives the example of chess where a player can use a pre-determined set of rules to try and win against a human opponent. However, when it comes to grappling, this is not always possible as there is a "physical world" in which the fight takes place. Machine learning, or the ability to build a machine that can learn from data, is a possible way to overcome this obstacle.

02:35:00
Lex Fridman discusses the history of man versus machine chess, highlighting that computers can't ever compete on a level with a human due to their number of options. Heuristics, or rules of thumb, are used to give general guidelines to action. In Jiu Jitsu, for example, don't turn your back on your opponent.

02:40:00
John Danaher discusses the history of how heuristic rules helped humans become better at intellectual pursuits, from chess to go. He notes that as computers got more powerful, these rules-based methods of learning became even more effective. With the advent of machine learning, humans are now competing against computers in increasingly complex fields.

02:45:00
In the video, John Danaher discusses how chess and other similar games can be improved by pairing human intelligence with computer power. He goes on to say that, if it is a cyborg version of Gordon Ryan with enhanced computational abilities, then humans would lose every time.

02:50:00
John Danaher discusses the difficulties of creating AI systems that can match or even exceed the abilities of human beings in grappling, judo, and MMA. He also discusses the potential for robots to develop strategies for grappling in uncertain environments, similar to the way they might learn to pick up cups.

02:55:00
In this video, John Danaher discusses the differences between robots and humans, and how robots might be more powerful than humans in the near future. He also discusses the potential for cyborgs, which are humans that have been augmented with technology.

03:00:00
The video discusses the increasing use of artificial intelligence in various military systems, including drones and manned aircraft. It points out the human weakness of being able to reason and problem solve under stress, and how this can be exploited by computers. Jujitsu players can benefit from learning heuristic rules and principles, which can help them perform better on the mat.

03:05:00
John Danaher discusses the unique human gift of arriving at heuristic rules and principles which guide our behavior, and how starting from the ground up is the best way to learn these essential skills. He advises white belts to focus on learning to escape and retain guard in their first few months of training, and advises beginners to focus on learning to defend against positions and escape.

03:10:00

03:25:00
The author discuss the meaning of life and how it has evolved over time, from the simple survival of early human beings to the more complex challenges of our current era. He discusses how Texas would be a good place to open a gym because of its high population density and infrastructure, and how both he and his team would enjoy training there.

03:30:00
John Danaher discusses the difficulties of finding meaning in life when survival is guaranteed, and how to create meaning in one's life by taking charge and writing one's own story.

03:35:00
John Danaher discusses the importance of having a goal in training and competition, emphasizing the importance of skill development over victory. He encourages listeners to identify their partner's strengths and to regularly challenge themselves.
