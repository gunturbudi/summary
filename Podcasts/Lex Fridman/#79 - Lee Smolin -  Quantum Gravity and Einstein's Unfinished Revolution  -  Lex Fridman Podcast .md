# Summary of Lee Smolin: Quantum Gravity and Einstein's Unfinished Revolution | Lex Fridman Podcast #79

In the video "Lee Smolin: Quantum Gravity and Einstein's Unfinished Revolution | Lex Fridman Podcast #79", Lee Smolin discusses the unfinished revolution in quantum mechanics started by Einstein. He argues that there are two competing theories to explain the measurement problem, and that space-time is an emergent phenomenon. He also suggests that the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics may be a better way to understand how people would behave in such a situation.
Smolin discusses the problems with string theory and how it may not be able to be empirically tested. He also talks about his book, Life of the Cosmos, which is about how science works and the role of community and ethics.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Lee Smolin is a theoretical physicist who has made contributions to cosmology, quantum field theory, the foundations of quantum mechanics, theoretical biology, and the philosophy of science. He has also written books criticizing the state of physics and string theory, and his latest book, "Einsteins unfinished revolution: the search for what lies beyond the quantum," explores the nature of our universe. In this interview, Smolin discusses whether or not everything that exists is merely a creation of our mind, and whether or not it is a crazy idea. He also discusses the version of this idea that is not crazy at all, and the role of perception in human experience.

00:05:00
Lee Smolin discusses the idea that there is no "scientific method," and argues that this undermines the idea that scientists can be right or wrong. He goes on to discuss the idea that science is a community of people with shared ethical precepts, and how this affects the way scientists operate.

00:10:00
The video discusses the contributions of physicist Lee Smolin to the field of quantum gravity. Smolin discusses the importance of error-prone experimentation and training, and explains how progress in science is often made through the combination of experimental and theoretical work. He also discusses the importance of connecting disparate pieces of scientific evidence in order to form a cohesive theory.

00:15:00
In "Lee Smolin: Quantum Gravity and Einstein's Unfinished Revolution", physicist Lee Smolin discusses how quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity led to a partial revolution in physics, but how they are still incomplete. He discusses how realism is the belief that the physical world is independent of our existence, and how the human mind has a role in this view.

00:20:00
Lee Smolin discusses the different camps of anti-realists and argues that while there may be limits to our cognitive abilities, reality itself is still open to interpretation.

00:25:00
In his latest book, "Einstein's Unfinished Revolution," physicist Lee Smolin explores the origins of quantum mechanics and relativity theory, and argues that we need to continue work on these theories to achieve our full understanding of the universe.

00:30:00
In this video, Lee Smolin discusses the unfinished revolution in physics that was started by Albert Einstein and continued by others. He points out that there are two competing theories to explain the measurement problem--one which assumes that quantum mechanics is correct, and the other which assumes that it needs to be completed. He also argues that space-time is an emergent phenomenon and not fundamental.

00:35:00
In his latest video, Lee Smolin discusses the concept of time being fundamental and how causality is from the "yes" in quantum mechanics. He also discusses space not being fundamental and how events create other events, but there is no space between them. This is a level of description in which there are events, but causality does not reside in space.

00:40:00
In this video, Lee Smolin discusses quantum gravity and Einstein's unfinished revolution. He explains that the two definitions of locality, which are operative field operators corresponding to events in space-time and Bell locality, are both false. Bell locality is tested to be false by experiments, and Einstein's definition is found to be false by the inequality of correlations. This demonstrates that causality is not fundamental in quantum physics, and that breaking away from locality is a crucial step in understanding quantum mechanics.

00:45:00
Lee Smolin discusses the challenges of solving the "unfinished revolution" in quantum mechanics, and discusses his view of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. He notes that the idea is both beautiful and difficult, and that he would like to have a conversation with Sean Carroll about it.

00:50:00
Lee Smolin discusses the difficulties with applying probability in the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics and suggests that decision theory may be a better tool for understanding how people would behave in such a situation.

00:55:00
The author of a 2006 book criticizing string theory for taking away from the rigors of the scientific method suggests that this problem is currently widespread in physics, and suggests ways to fix it.

01:00:00
Lee Smolin discusses the problem with string theory and how it may not be able to be empirically tested. He also talks about his book, Life of the Cosmos, which is about how science works and the role of community and ethics.

01:05:00
Lee Smolin discusses his book, "The End of Nature," and how it discusses the unfinished revolution in physics. He regrets that the same critique applies to other communities in science, and that he never wrote about "the community" in an explicit way. He encourages listeners to attend upcoming conferences in quantum gravity, and to keep an open mind.
