In this conversation with historian Stephen Kotkin, Alex discusses his previous podcast episode with Oliver Stone, in which the two discuss Vladimir Putin and the war in Ukraine. Stephen provides a comprehensive and critical analysis of Putin and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, drawing on geopolitics and history. He emphasizes the importance of Stalin as a singular figure in Russian history and the dangers of exaggerated comparisons between Putin and Stalin. While Alex is still considering travel to Russia, this conversation makes him even more wary of doing so.

In this video, Stephen Kotkin discusses the dilemma that Russia has faced for centuries: being unable to match the power of the West. Kotkin goes on to say that, in the fullness of time, Stalin lost the peace and putin inherited some of this attempt to reverse it. He also points out that, by the time the 1990s rolled around, Russia had withdrawn from all of its advanced positions from the World War II victory.

00:10:00
Stephen Kotkin discusses the history of dictators such as Stalin, Mao, and Hitler, and how their policies led to mass death and destruction.

00:15:00
In this Lex Fridman podcast, Stephen Kotkin discusses Putin, Stalin, Hitler, and Zelenskyy, and their attitudes towards war in Ukraine. Kotkin argues that Navalny is one of the most important people in the country, and that Patrushev is a version of Putin's right-hand man. Patrick Chef has been giving interviews in the press recently, and Kotkin points out that his conspiratorial theory is similar to Putin's. Stalin had the same mindset, believing that everything that happened in the world was part of a Western plot to bring down the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, the Germans are voluntarily increasing their dependence on Russian energy, and the French are constantly seeking concessions from the West. The British provide money laundering and reputation laundering services for the Russian oligarchy, and Obama unsuccessfully tries to reset relations with Russia after the Georgian War. Finally, Putin tells Trump that he's right and the West is conspiring to bring Russia down.

Stephen Kotkin discusses the history of international alliances and organizations, noting that Russia has signed agreements recognizing the freedom of other countries to choose alliances. He then discusses the Ukraine conflict, noting that while it is not Russia's fault that they are weaker than the West, they do make a strategic choice to pursue a "chemical pursuit" to stand up to the West.

Kotkin also discusses the concept of "power geopolitics," which he defines as the use of power to achieve geopolitical goals, such as maintaining Russia's position as a great power.

The article discusses Henry Kissinger's opinion that wars in which the U.S. gets involved typically end in disaster, with three examples of this being World War I, World War II, and the current war in Ukraine.

02:10:00
The video discusses the history of Russia, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Petro Zelenskyy, and how their respective policies regarding neighboring countries have led to war in Ukraine. Russia's desire for a sphere of influence that is separate from the west has not been successful, and the blame for this failure is put on the west.

02:15:00
In this video, Stephen Kotkin discusses how the leaders of Russia, China, and Ukraine all seem to prioritize trade over other issues, such as war or human rights.

If Navalny can't break this loyalty, there is little chance of an authoritarian regime succeeding in Russia.

02:30:00
