00:50:00
Chris Duffin discusses the value of burning bridges in order to move on to a new, better life. He emphasizes the importance of having a "north star" to guide you, and warns against pursuing short-term goals instead.

00:55:00
Chris Duffin discusses the different types of strength training and how they differ in terms of their athletic qualities. He also discusses how training can be customized to match an individual's goals.

01:00:00
In this video, Chris Duffin discusses the principles of training and how they apply to strength athletes. He also discusses how to cycle conditioning work and how to prevent overtraining.

01:05:00
In this video, Chris Duffin discusses how to consistently train to achieve goals, focusing on spikes in acute loading rather than movement quality. He explains how this works in terms of cycles of training, with different phases of the cycle focusing on different qualities. He also discusses how to progressively increase the average load of a deadlift or squat session, eventually reaching a high level of performance.

01:10:00
Chris Duffin discusses his average load for squats this week and next week, how the intensity of the week affects the ease of the week, how to develop work capacity by specializing in different movement vectors, and how different positions of the bar on the squat affect spinal mechanics.

01:15:00
Chris Duffin discusses how his training cycle works and how it applies to sports that combine skill and strength. He discusses how injury prevention is a benefit of resilience training, and how adding strength to a skill can help an athlete progress further. He also discusses how early development of movement patterns can help individuals achieve success in sports.

01:20:00
Chris Duffin discusses the importance of tension and relaxation in combat sports, and how this affects movement quality. He recommends using Fascial Soft Tissue tools to correct deficits in movement quality and prevent injuries.

01:25:00
Chris Duffin is a combat sport strength coach and scientist who has developed a methodologies and coaching platform to help people achieve their fitness goals. Kabuki Strength Lab, formerly known as the Elite Performance Center in Oregon, was a place where he tested and developed his methods.

01:30:00
Chris Duffin is a strength coach and scientist who has developed innovative equipment, such as the Transform Bar, to help athletes train more effectively. He also specializes in creating cultures of accountability and intensity in his gyms, which helps to create a sense of community among athletes.

01:35:00
The video showcases Chris Duffin's horizontal and vertical pulley system for handheld weights, which is designed to be a complete gym in one product. The system takes up the space of a bed, and has two bars - a hex bar and a pressing bar - with handles that are off-parallel with the axis, which creates instability. The bars are biomechanically sound and are great for playground physics exercises, such as teeter-totters and swings.

Chris Duffin, a mad scientist of strength, discusses his company's Barefoot Athletics, which focuses on optimizing the human-ground interface through barefoot running.

01:45:00
Chris Duffin discusses how the foot is different from other body parts and how it needs to be trained to be stronger and more resilient. He challenges the notion that orthotics provide any long-term benefit and instead recommends that people use their feet to strengthen them and learn to control them. He also discusses how shoes can be helpful, but they are not the only tool necessary for strength and health.

01:50:00
Chris Duffin discusses low back pain, attributing it to a variety of factors, including inability to control spinal position and breathing issues.
