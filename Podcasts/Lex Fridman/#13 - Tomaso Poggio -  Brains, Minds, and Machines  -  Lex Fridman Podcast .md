Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Tommaso Poggio is a professor at MIT and director of the Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines. He has had a profound impact on our understanding of the nature of intelligence in both biological and artificial neural networks, and has been an advisor to many highly impactful researchers and entrepreneurs in AI. He shares his thoughts on the possibility of time travel and the power of intelligence.

00:05:00
Tomaso Poggio discusses the motivation behind his work in the field of artificial intelligence and how he believes that understanding the functionality of the human brain is the key to building intelligent systems.

00:10:00
Tomaso Poggio discusses the differences between artificial and biological neural networks, stating that the former are too simplistic relative to the latter. He goes on to say that recent work has shown that these networks are closer to the brain than previously thought.

00:15:00
Tomaso Poggio discusses differences between the brain and deep learning, and how the need for labeled data is a challenge in deep learning. He also discusses how children are surprisingly good at learning new things, and how much of it is hardware vs. software.

00:20:00
Tomaso Poggio is a renowned neuroscientist who has contributed some profound ideas in these fields. His hunch is that the face part of the brain is concentrated on face recognition. This is something that is either born with or can be learned quickly. Harvard's Marge Livingstone has done some amazing experiments in which she raised baby monkeys deprived of faces during the first weeks of life. Her results show that the monkey's area of the brain that is supposed to be sensitive to faces was not affected.

00:25:00
Tomaso Poggio discusses the similarities and differences between the brain and computer, explaining that while the hardware is similar, the way in which the brain learns is much more complex.

00:30:00
Tomaso Poggio discusses the concept of compositionality, which he defines as the ability of a system to be understood by breaking it down into its component parts. He suggests that the level of understanding required to understand a computer is separate from the level of understanding required to understand the brain, and that the complexity of these two systems is intentional. He believes that the complexity of the brain is one of the greatest problems in science, and that understanding compositionality is essential for understanding the brain.

00:35:00
Tomaso Poggio discusses the compositionality of problems that can be solved using deep neural networks, and how this relates to the brain's ability to learn and optimize. He also discusses the stochastic gradient descent algorithm used to optimize these networks.

00:40:00
Tomaso Poggio discusses the architecture of the brain, which is remarkably similar to the architecture of deep neural networks. He also discusses the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, which is a successful technique for learning.

00:45:00
In this video, Tomaso Poggio describes the theorem that states that you can approximate any continuous function with a polynomial. He also discusses the challenges of unsupervised learning, and how Ganz networks might help to overcome them.

00:50:00
Tomaso Poggio discusses how a network trained with the same dataset can be inverted to produce the image, and how this can be used for computer graphics applications. He also talks about the history of computer graphics, and how one-shot networks can be used to learn much faster.

00:55:00
Tomaso Poggio discusses the gap between effective visual recognition and understanding of scenes and argues that worrying about large-scale unintended consequences of intelligent systems is better done early rather than late.

01:00:00
Tomaso Poggio discusses levels of understanding, the difficulty of understanding ethics, and how neuroscience can help us better understand ethics.

01:05:00
Tomaso Poggio is a leading researcher in the field of artificial intelligence, and he discusses the importance of consciousness in relation to intelligence. He also discusses the possibility that consciousness is necessary for a machine to be considered intelligent, and that mortality may be an important factor in achieving this.

01:10:00
Tomaso Poggio, a cognitive scientist, discusses the importance of curiosity and how it helps scientists and engineers become successful. He also mentions the importance of having fun and having friends who are similarly curious.

01:15:00
Tomaso Poggio discusses how he thinks intelligence may be a gift or curse, and how he tries to create intelligent systems that understand the universe. He also discusses whether intelligence is a good or bad thing, and how he tries to create a meaningful life for himself.

01:20:00
