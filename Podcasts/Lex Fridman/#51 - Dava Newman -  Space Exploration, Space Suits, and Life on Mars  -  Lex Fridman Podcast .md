David Newman discusses the psychology of space exploration and how it impacts team dynamics. She also discusses Ferdinand Magellan's crew and the challenges they faced during their voyage around the world 500 years ago.

00:05:00
Dava Newman discusses her love for exploration and space exploration, including the Apollo program and current exploration of Mars. She believes that humans are necessary for space exploration, and that the next decade will see evidence of past life on Mars.

00:10:00
Dava Newman discusses her excitement for the Artemis program, which is designed to send astronauts to the moon and then on to Mars. She notes that the program is a great proving ground for new technologies, and that the moon is a great place to test out these technologies.

00:15:00
The video discusses Dava Newman's opinion on space exploration, space suits, and life on Mars. Newman points out that while the moon is a good place for exploration, it is still a tough mission. She also mentions that while SpaceX is a great company, it is ultimately government funded.

00:20:00
The video discusses the importance of risk taking in space exploration, with Dava Newman noting that NASA and other government agencies are good at delivering safe projects, but that SpaceX and other private companies are taking bigger risks in order to push the envelope and achieve greater success. Overall, Newman is excited about the current state of space exploration, which is seeing greater democratization and increased research opportunities due to the use of smaller, cheaper satellites.

The space suit of the future is designed to be as tight-fitting as possible to allow for more mobility, and it will be powered by mechanical counter-pressure. The suit will also have augmented reality capabilities and a communication system that allows the wearer to see maps and read information from a screen inside the suit.

00:30:00
Dava Newman discusses the importance of artificial intelligence in space exploration, describing how AI systems will help with tasks such as autonomous flight control and resource utilization. He also discusses how the moon is a good testing ground for new technologies, and how Mars will require even more sophisticated autonomy.

00:35:00
Dava Newman discusses the future of space exploration and how humans will be living on other planets in the next 100-200 years. She also talks about her efforts to get the first woman to step on Mars by the 2030s.
