Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
The video discusses climate change, with Bjorn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin discussing the spectrum of opinion on the issue. Lomborg argues that the idea of climate change being a hoax is extremism, while Revkin argues that the planet is already changing due to CO2 levels, and that the issue is more complex than the idea of a single question.

00:05:00
The video discusses the differing opinions on climate change between Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin. Lomborg argues that the issue is more complicated than "belief" or "disbelief" and that it is necessary to look at all factors involved in climate change. Revkin counters that the focus on the "Greenhouse Effect" and "pollution" has been ineffective and that we need to focus on mitigating climate hazards.

00:10:00
In this YouTube video, Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin debate the existence of climate change. Lomborg argues that climate change is a hoax, while Revkin argues that it is a reality and humans are primarily responsible.

00:15:00
The video discusses how Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin disagree on the role of climate change in recent disasters, with Lomborg asserting that it is not primarily caused by CO2 emissions and Revkin asserting that it is. Lawrence Bauer, a professor of environmental science at the University of Virginia, argues that it is impossible to say how much of the recent disasters were caused by climate change, but that it is important to talk about other ways in which climate change could harm humans.

00:20:00
The video discusses the climate change debate, focusing on Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin. Lex Fridman argues that, while the media’s focus on Earth-ending events is counterproductive, Greta Thunberg’s promotion of the fear is ultimately helpful. He suggests that, in order to have a productive conversation about climate change, people need to be directed towards solutions that are both realistic and achievable.

00:25:00
Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin argue that electric cars are good for the environment, but not the best solution for reducing carbon emissions. They say that electric cars are more effective and cheaper than gas cars, but that they still emit a lot of carbon dioxide. They encourage more focus on electric motorcycles and third world cities, where they would do more good for the environment.

00:30:00
Bjorn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin discuss the strengths and potential blind spots of different disciplines when it comes to understanding climate change. Lomborg argues that electric cars will have a small impact on climate change, while Revkin argues that electric cars are a key way to reduce carbon emissions.

00:35:00
Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin debate whether climate change is a problem, with Lomborg arguing that there are many cheaper and more effective ways to reduce carbon emissions. Revkin points out that models often exclude resistance to new technologies, while Lomborg argues that human beings are doing almost everything right but are not yet doing everything right.

00:40:00
Bjørn Lomborg, a Danish author and journalist, discusses his views on climate change in 2006, before the phenomenon became widely publicized. He interviews social scientist Helen Ingram, who explains that people are more likely to vote based on salient and certain issues, rather than worrying about climate change. Lomborg reflects on the principles of journalism, and how they can be applied to climate change.

00:45:00
The video features a climate change debate between Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin. Lomborg argues that if humans are bad for the environment, then we should have a carbon tax for kids because a bigger family in America is a big source of more emissions. Pilkey was derailed intentionally by people who thought his message was too off the path.

00:50:00
In this video, Bjorn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin discuss the climate change debate. Lomborg argues that it is difficult to make meaningful progress on reducing carbon emissions, while Revkin notes that other measures, such as improving sanitation, are more effective and cheaper. Lomborg also notes the psychological effect of martyrdom, and Revkin responds that he is not playing the martyr and is instead trying to engage with those who disagree.

00:55:00
Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin debate the pros and cons of scientific advancements such as gene editing and Crispr-based mosquito eradication.

01:00:00
The video discusses the climate change debate between Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin. Lomborg argues that we should not try to prevent climate change, as doing so would have negative consequences, while Revkin argues that we should do something to prevent it, as it is a massive threat to humanity.

01:05:00
In this video, Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin debate the effects of climate change. Lomborg argues that the world is getting greener, while Revkin points out that more green stuff doesn't equate to a more sustainable world. Lomborg also discusses the importance of reducing poverty in order to make the environment a more important issue.

01:10:00
In this video, Bjorn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin debate the potential effects of climate change on various sectors of society. Lomborg argues that climate change is a false alarm, and that the worst effects of climate change will be the extinction of the human species.

01:15:00
Climate change is a real challenge, but if you're fairly well off, you can deal with it. Developing countries are likely to be closer to Holland towards the end of the century, due to their increasing wealth. However, climate change will be a challenge for most of the world, and a potential system collapse is possible. It is possible to model the effects of climate change, but it is not clear if humans are able to respond effectively to changes of this magnitude.

01:20:00
The video discusses the rise of Chicago, the response of human civilization to the covert pandemic, and the consequences of global warming. It also discusses the average projection for the next 100 years as the temperature rises 2 degrees Celsius.

01:25:00
The video discusses the concept of climate change, and discusses how different groups of people are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. It also discusses a study which found that people in poorer households are more likely to delay turning on air conditioning in a heat wave, and this can have adverse consequences.

01:30:00
The video discusses the connection between climate change and hurricanes, earthquakes, and other extreme weather events. The scientists discussing the connection note that there is a lot of evidence linking climate change to these events, and that it is important to focus on the problem rather than get bogged down in the details.

01:35:00
The video covers the topic of climate change and hurricanes. It discusses how hurricanes are rare, and how they have not changed much over the course of human history. Joe Muller, a climate scientist at Florida Gulf Coast University, explains that there is evidence that global warming may be contributing to the increased frequency and intensity of hurricanes. The interviewer asks the guest if there is a connection between global warming and the increased frequency and intensity of storms, to which the guest responds that it is still too early to say for certain.

01:40:00
The researchers found that the drought in the 1970s-1994 was due to pollution from smog. This led to a reduction in hurricanes crossing the Atlantic, and may lead to fewer hurricanes in the future.

01:45:00
The video discusses how, despite the increase in hurricanes, the overall trend is downward. It argues that this is primarily due to increased resiliency, which is a result of a more informed public.

01:50:00
The video discusses how Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin debate climate change. Lomborg argues that the world has been doing a bad job of addressing climate change, while Revkin argues that it is an emergency that needs to be addressed quickly.

01:55:00
The video discusses Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin's debate on climate change. Lomborg argues that focusing on climate change causes guilt and distraction from more important issues, while Revkin points out that the IPCC has a history of thorough and accurate predictions. The video concludes that, although climate change is a serious issue, the focus on carbon dioxide is misguided and the media is to blame for exaggerating the severity of the situation.

02:00:00
The video discusses how climate change is costing trillions of dollars, and how the cost will be even greater in the future. The main points are that the cost will be higher due to the fact that we're making policies that will have a minimal impact in the future, and that the cost is due to the fact that we are a small part of the emissions that are going to come out in the 21st century.

02:05:00
The video discusses the issues of climate change, and how Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin differ on the matter. Lomborg argues that the benefits of climate change are relatively small, while Revkin argues that the costs of climate change are too high. The discussion also touches on the geopolitical implications of climate change.

02:10:00
Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin debate the costs and benefits of renewable energy versus fossil fuel subsidies. Lomborg argues that fossil fuel subsidies are wasteful and inefficient, and that renewable energy is expensive and not necessary. He also argues that the models used to calculate the costs of climate change do not take into account the increased need for fossil fuels in the future.

02:15:00
The video discusses Bjørn Lomborg's book "The Skeptical Environmentalist" and its criticism of climate change policies. Lomborg argues that the estimates for how much climate change costs and how much it will cost to prevent are too uncertain and that the consensus on climate change among scientists is not justified. Revkin and Lex Fridman debate Lomborg's arguments, with Revkin noting that Lomborg fails to take into account the effects of climate change on society.

02:20:00
The Lex Fridman podcast discusses climate change with Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin. Lomborg argues that subsidies for fossil fuels should be eliminated, as they hurt the poor and do not do much good. Revkin counters that there are many areas where reducing subsidies would do more good than harm. The podcast also discusses Jonathan Swift's Modest Proposal, which suggests that reducing the number of children born to the poor would be a more effective way to help them than providing subsidies for the food industry.

02:25:00
Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin debate the costs and benefits of various interventions to address climate change. Lomborg argues that the benefits don't justify the costs, while Revkin argues that the benefits are much greater than the costs.

02:30:00
In this video, Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin discuss the benefits of e-procurement, which can reduce corruption and increase efficiency in government spending.

02:35:00
The Lex Fridman podcast discusses climate change with Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin. Lomborg notes that, despite the difficulties of fixing global education problems, improving climate change is an easier task. Revkin counters that we should focus on the more difficult issues, such as fixing vulnerability to hurricanes. Lomborg and Revkin also discuss the benefits of digital currencies in India, which have helped reduce poverty among the poor.

02:40:00
The video discusses how to spend money to make the most impact on climate change, and suggests investing in things like fourth-generation nuclear power. If these technologies become cheaper than fossil fuels, it will be easier for everyone to switch to them.

02:45:00
The video discusses the idea of spending money on innovation instead of trying to solve climate change in the next 12 years. It argues that this is a failed approach, as the United States has not been doing enough in this area over the past few decades.

02:50:00
In this video, Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin debate the importance of innovation and production efficiency in addressing climate change. Lomborg argues that while innovation is important, production efficiency is just as, if not more, important. He also discusses the role of relative costs in climate change mitigation.

02:55:00
The video discusses the debate between Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin on climate change, and how the alarmism over nuclear power in the past has led to harmful policies. Lomborg argues that we should focus on more productive forms of innovation, such as the carbon tax, to solve climate change rather than relying on nuclear power.

03:00:00
Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin debate the pros and cons of fossil fuels, with Lomborg arguing in favor of more oil, coal, and natural gas. Epstein argues for a move away from fossil fuels, based on their moral case.

03:05:00
The author discusses how Bjørn Lomborg, an economist, disagrees with the idea that humans are causing global warming, and how this disagreement has implications for the future of fossil fuels.

03:10:00
In his talk at the Glasgow climate talks, sustainability scientist Johan Rockstrom outlined the Equity Argument, which states that rich countries need to drastically reduce their emissions in order to allow poor countries to develop their fossil fuels in a way that is fair. Alex Fridman points out that this is a difficult task, given that many rich countries rely on fossil fuels.

03:15:00
Americans have varying opinions on climate change, but the majority of Democrats and younger Americans believe that dealing with the issue should be a top priority. In the context of public opinion polls, science literacy is important in order to understand the various scientific truths around climate change. The lack of understanding of scientific facts among some Americans is also exacerbated by their political affiliation. However, when communicating climate change policy, it is important to focus on human factors and not just the science.

03:20:00
The video discusses the climate change debate, with Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin arguing that there is no red blue divide on climate change, energy innovation, or whether CO2 should be regulated as a pollutant. The discussion then turns to the 17 states fighting Obama's Clean Power Plan, with Oklahoma, Iowa, and other states achieving the targets of the plan because they are expanding wind power already.

03:25:00
The video discusses the importance of cooperating with others in order to achieve common goals, such as reducing climate change. It references a CNN journalist's experience visiting a town in Oklahoma that was skeptical of climate change, and how he was able to talk to locals about the issue. It points out that if journalists try to talk to everyone they disagree with, they may not be able to effectively communicate their message.

03:30:00
In this video, Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin debate the role of journalists in reporting on climate change. Lomborg argues that journalists should empathize with bad actors in order to understand them, while Revkin argues that journalists should push back against bad actors to protect their reputation and their safety.

03:35:00
The video discusses the idea that presidents have little to no impact on climate change policy, with different presidents implementing different models of climate treaty negotiations. The main points made are that the rate of decarbonization has been going on for 150 years, and that presidents have little to no impact on the rate of decarbonization.

03:40:00
The video discusses how climate change can be difficult to measure, with both sides of the debate citing different statistics. Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin debate the issue, with Revkin saying that the world is not doing as well as it should be, while Lomborg says that the world is doing better than expected, thanks to technological advances.

03:45:00
In this YouTube video, Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin debate the climate change emergency label. Lomborg argues that there is a vulnerability emergency hiding behind the climate emergency label, and Revkin points out that Bangladesh has been hit by comparable storms recently and it's not just because of wealth. Lomborg gives advice to young people on how to have a positive impact on the world.

03:50:00
In this video, Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin debate the pros and cons of climate change. Lomborg emphasizes the need for individuals to have a sense of urgency, but also a sense of patience, in order to effectively tackle climate change. He also points out that energy transitions take time, and that in order to be effective, individuals must oscillate back and forth between urgency and patience.

03:55:00
In this YouTube video, Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin debate the role of scientists in communicating climate change information. Lomborg emphasizes the importance of communicating science in an interesting and engaging way, while Revkin points out the possible disadvantages of such a focus. Lomborg argues that scientists have a responsibility to communicate their work to the public, while Revkin believes that this is a task that should be left to more experienced scientists. Lomborg also discusses the power of YouTube as a medium for education and communication.

04:00:00
The two speakers discuss the purpose of life, and how to live a meaningful and satisfying life while also addressing the consequences of humanity's actions. Lomborg argues that it is important to focus on making the world a better place, even if this means sacrificing some short-term material gain. Revkin agrees, but stresses the importance of understanding the long-term consequences of our actions.

04:05:00
Bjørn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin debate climate change, with Lomborg advocating for a more cautious approach, and Revkin advocating for action. Lomborg discusses the idea of "winning" and "losing" in relation to climate change, and how making small changes can lead to a more sustainable future. Lomborg also discusses his recent stroke, which has led him to think more deeply about his own existence. The two discuss the importance of accepting that climate change is a transient phenomenon, and the courage to face the challenges that remain. Lomborg concludes the video by recommending that people listen to his album, "The Fine Line".

04:10:00
The video features a debate between Bjorn Lomborg and Andrew Revkin about climate change. Lomborg argues that the world is not heating up, while Revkin argues that the world is. Thoreau's quote about heaven being under our feet as well as over our heads is included at the end of the video.
