# Summary of Eric Weinstein: Revolutionary Ideas in Science, Math, and Society | Lex Fridman Podcast #16

In this video, Eric Weinstein discusses the state of academia, noting its decline in recent years. He argues that the pressure to perform brilliantly and the fear of being wrong are causing a state of madness in academia. He also discusses his involvement in a conspiracy to destroy the bargaining power of American academics.
In the podcast, Eric Weinstein discusses a variety of topics relating to ideas, progress, and society. He argues that we need to be more open to radical thoughts and that current methods of social control, such as algorithms, are not effective. He also discusses the potential for a new kind of capitalism, "anthropic capitalism," which takes into account the impact of humans on the planet.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Eric Weinstein is a mathematician, economist, physicist, and the managing director of Thiel Capital. He coined the term and is the founder of the Intellectual Dark Web, which is a loosely assembled group of public intellectuals. He discusses his teachers and one in particular, Master Oogway, the turtle from Kung Fu Panda.  He says that the teaching that really matters is transferred during a single conversation and it's very brief. His teachers include his grandfather, Harry Rubin, his grandmother, and Tom Lehrer. Tom Lehrer's songs "Poisoning Pigeons in the Park" and "Stanislavsky of the Musky Arts" were both plagiarized, making him one of the few people to ever achieve this. Wit is connected to intelligence and humor is a reflection of intelligence.

00:05:00
Eric Weinstein discusses how artificial intelligence systems cannot replicate themselves in the physical world, but software can. He discusses the importance of the physical world and the separation between the logical and physical worlds.

00:10:00
Eric Weinstein discusses the idea of artificial outtelligence, which is the ability of machines to outsmart humans. He argues that this is already happening and that artificial general intelligence is not needed to do so.

00:15:00
Eric Weinstein discusses the possibility that we may need to start worrying about the possibility of self-modifying code becoming uncontrollable and destructive, given that it is within our reach. He also mentions a letter written by Edward Teller in which the physicist warns of the potential dangers of developing atomic weaponry.

00:20:00
Eric Weinstein discusses the potential negative and positive effects of technology on society. He argues that we need to be more cautious about how technology is used, as it has the potential to be both destructive and helpful. He also suggests that the meaning of life is still a mystery, and that the stability of the past few decades is in part due to the creativity of the people who designed and used nuclear weapons.

00:25:00
Eric Weinstein, a scientist and thinker, discusses the need to resume above ground testing of nuclear devices due to the current generation of people who have not experienced an existential threat. He cites the TV show "The Day After" as a example of how a generation can be affected by a profound event. He also mentions the breaking of the global narrative three times in his life- once after the election of Donald Trump, another time after the fall of Lehman Brothers, and 9/11. He discusses how the current generation is not as mindful of the danger of the world as previous generations were and how this might lead to dangerous consequences.

00:30:00
Eric Weinstein discusses the competing narratives in society and how they are pushing towards different outcomes. He talks about the tensions between nations and how they could lead to war. He also discusses how humans are naturally prone to fear and how this can be a good thing, as it can be a wake-up call.

00:35:00
Lex Fridman asks Eric Weinstein why he enjoys geometry, to which Weinstein responds that he doesn't really know if he enjoys it, but is good at it. Weinstein then goes on to talk about his theory of a unified theory, which is based on the idea that there is a 14-dimensional universe that is connected to the 4-dimensional space time continuum.

00:40:00
Eric Weinstein discusses the importance of creativity and originality in mathematics, science, and society. He notes that being inside academia or within a well-established system can stifle creativity, whereas going outside can lead to lunatics and crazies. He believes that progress is more likely to come from those who manage to stay within the system and take on a larger amount of heresy.

00:45:00
In this video, Eric Weinstein discusses how academia is declining in terms of the older population of faculty, the shrinking number of younger faculty, and the increasing importance of the Baby Boomer generation. He also discusses his hope for the future of physics, in which he believes that the community of physicists is as profound as any in history.

00:50:00
Eric Weinstein critiques the current state of physics, highlighting its problems while also praising its achievements. He discusses how the current system of academia neglects physics and how this might be a problem in the future. He also discusses his involvement in a conspiracy to destroy the bargaining power of American academics.

00:55:00
Eric Weinstein argues that academia is in a state of madness, caused by the pressure to perform brilliantly and the fear of being wrong. He says that the fields of science, engineering, and humanities are experiencing pressure to tolerate new radical ideas, but that it is changing a bit recently.

01:00:00
Eric Weinstein discusses the importance of ideas, how they can be correct or crazy, and the difficulty of determining who to protect and who to kill in the pursuit of progress. He argues that using human elements, such as rules and fairness, will not work and that radical thought should be encouraged.

01:05:00
Eric Weinstein discusses how algorithms can be used to push certain ideas and opinions out of the way, and why it's important to ask why something is disagreeable before pushing it on others. He goes on to say that these conversations are actually about social control, and that we need to be more transparent about what these algorithms are doing behind the scenes.

01:10:00
Eric Weinstein discusses how he found pleasure in interviewing interesting people, the effect of technology on capitalism, and the need for free societies to have self-organized individuals. He also discusses the potential for socialism due to the fact that capitalism is slow to address the needs of the median individual.

01:15:00
Eric Weinstein discusses the idea of "anthropic capitalism," which is a new kind of capitalism that takes into account the impact that humans have on the planet. He discusses the challenges of hyper capitalism and hyper socialism and how they will need to be coupled together in order to succeed. He also discusses his own struggles with social media, fame, and pain.

01:20:00
Eric Weinstein discusses the importance of struggling and taking personal responsibility for one's success and failures in today's economy. He urges listeners to keep their humanity in mind and to recognize that not all is their fault.
