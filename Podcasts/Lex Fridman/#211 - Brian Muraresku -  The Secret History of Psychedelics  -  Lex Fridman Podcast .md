Brian Muraresku discusses the idea that some of the ancient philosophers, including Plato, believed that experience was a bit strange because he thought of reality as being just an imperfect view of things. Gordon Watson felt that on mushrooms he was spying the archetypes and he talks about Plato in this famous article that is released in 1957 in Life magazine. A well-read individual from the mid-20th century has his premier psychedelic experience and outcomes Plato because what he was witnessing was so sharp, brilliant and detailed. Terence McKenna also talks about the poetry he used while on DMT, but more specifically about this place that they seem to all travel to. The big question is if it is really more real than real, and the ancient philosophers were asking the same question. Some means of attempting to answer this was by dying. If you ask Plato the definition of philosophy, he will say that to practice it in the right way is to practice dying and being dead. Many people describe the psychedelic experience in sort of near-death experience terms. Terence McKenna develops a taxonomy for how to analyze this and says that option number one is the semi-physical, but kind of elusive, beings that exist somewhere between mythology and zoology, option number two is the mental, somewhere

Brian Muraresku discusses the possible role of psychedelics in human history, including the idea that they may have led to the "great leap forward" 60,000 years ago. He also speaks with paleoanthropologist Lee Berger about ways to test this hypothesis.

00:25:00
This video discusses the possible connection between psychedelic substances and cave art, hypothesizing that these substances may have been used by early humans in order to experience altered states of consciousness. Lee Berger, a researcher in this field, talks about the evidence of psychedelic substances in dental calculus from ancient hominids. In 2012, another study found that Neanderthals were consuming yarrow and chamomile, which have been identified as medicinal plants. This video concludes with a discussion of how archaeochemists may be able to use their skills to trace the use of psychedelic substances back even further in time.

Brian Muraresku's book, "The Road to Ellucis," investigates the possible involvement of psychedelics in the development of Christianity. The author speaks with various archaeologists and botanists around the world, all of whom conclude that there is no evidence that psychedelics were used in ancient Christianity. However, this does not mean that psychedelics did not have some role in the development of Christianity. The author also speaks with Hans Peter Stika, a German archaeobotanist, who suggests that wine may have been spiked with psychedelics in order to create psychedelic experiences in early Christians.

The video discusses the history of psychedelics, focusing on the idea that they can be seen as tools to help achieve a deeper understanding of the nature of things. Aldous Huxley is discussed, as he was looking forward to a revival of religious experience that would come about through the use of biochemical discoveries such as the ones made today. Alan Watts is also mentioned, as he argued that there is nothing more dangerous to authority than a popular outbreak of mysticism. Huxley points to religion as something that should mean something to people, and that the use of psychedelics could help facilitate this.

Brian Muraresku discusses his belief that consciousness is an illusion and that the first document in western civilization is Homer's epics, which began by invoking an alien muse.
