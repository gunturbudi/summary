Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Daphne Koller, a computer science professor at Stanford University, discusses her work in biomedicine and machine learning, and how close we are to curing major diseases. She also mentions Alzheimer's and schizophrenia as diseases where we are very close to curing.

00:05:00
Daphne Koller, a computer scientist and entrepreneur, shares her thoughts on biomedicine and machine learning and how they can be used to fight diseases and aging. She notes that while the overlap between the two is evident, there are many different mechanisms at play in diseases and aging, and it is still not clear which is the most important to focus on. She advocates for an increased health span, and believes that reaching 120 or 100 years old would be an amazing goal.

00:10:00
Daphne Koller discusses her interest in human health and how it has evolved over time. She talks about her work on machine learning and data production to helpaddress challenges in human health. She also discusses how to create data sets that can be used by machine learning.

00:15:00
Daphne Koller discusses the importance of understanding biology and mechanism in order to create better, more effective drugs. She talks about her experience with autoimmune disease and how it settled in her lungs, leading to the need for prednisone treatment. She describes how her rheumatologist told her that the FDA would never approve prednisone treatment for her as the side effects to benefit ratio was not large enough. Koller started her own company, Seat Row, in 2018 with the goal of using machine learning to improve drug discovery.

00:20:00
Daphne Koller discusses the possibility of reverting human cells back to stem cells, which is an incredible process that has become industrialized over the last few years. She also discusses the variability between stem cells and how this affects their ability to create different types of cells.

00:25:00
Daphne Koller discusses her work in biomedical research and the role of genomics and machine learning in disease diagnosis and drug discovery. She notes that while genetics plays a role in disease susceptibility, it is only one part of the puzzle, and that cells and their activities provide a more accurate picture of disease development.

00:30:00
Daphne Koller, a Stanford professor and entrepreneur, discusses how biomedicine and machine learning can be used to treat diseases. She notes that diseases have a strong genetic basis, and that cellular models must be robust and reproducible in order to be useful. She also points out that diseases should be relatively contained in one or a few cell types for treatment with machine learning.

00:35:00
Daphne Koller, co-founder of Coursera and one of the leaders in the movement to make Massive Open Online Courses available to a wider audience, discusses the origins of MOOCs and the impact they have had on education. Koller also discusses her teaching style and how she has adapted it for large audiences.

00:40:00
Daphne Koller discusses how her experience with online education helped her learn about how to create effective courses that are both short and engaging for students. She also discusses the importance of engaging students during the content and providing feedback quickly.

00:45:00
Daphne Koller shares her thoughts on the future of education, noting that online learning will increasingly replace face-to-face learning, as it becomes more convenient and less expensive. She suggests that people start by getting started with the basics, and not skipping over foundational lessons.

00:50:00
Daphne Koller discusses how machine learning can be beautiful and surprising, and how neural networks can be surprisingly effective at learning complex representations. She also discusses how deep learning is still being figured out, and how knowledge-rich search spaces may still be necessary for achieving meaningful results.

00:55:00
Daphne Koller discusses the feasibility of artificial intelligence (AI) becoming smarter than humans, how self-doubt is important for AI systems, and the challenges of AGI in human level intelligence.

01:00:00
Daphne Koller discusses the potential dangers of artificial intelligence, noting that we don't yet understand how to protect ourselves against smarter machines. She also points out that the complexity of modern systems makes it difficult to anticipate the consequences of small changes.

01:05:00
Daphne Koller discusses the potential dangers of machine learning and gene editing, emphasizing the importance of social norms in preventing bad behavior. She is optimistic about the potential for these technologies, but notes the need for vigilance in their use.

01:10:00
Daphne Koller discusses her experiences with privilege and how she uses them to help make the world a better place. She also discusses her thoughts on ending life with honor, and thanks her listeners for listening.
