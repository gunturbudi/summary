00:10:00
Lex Fridman discusses how he believes that mathematics can be difficult at first, but can be rewarding if someone is able to invent something. He also discusses his philosophy on teaching, which is that students should be taught how to invent instead of memorizing methods.

00:15:00
Po-Shen Loh is the founder and CEO of NoVID, a startup that uses network theory and smartphones to control diseases. Loh's work is inspired by the fact that most attempts to control diseases have failed because of feedback loops that are negative for the people being controlled. Loh's team of user experience designers was essential to the success of NoVID.

00:20:00
The video discusses Po-Shen Loh's research on how to create a positive feedback loop to help prevent pandemics. One way to do this is to track how many physical relationships separate people from the disease. The idea is that the closer the spread of information is to the reality of the disease, the more effective the feedback loop will be. This is a very good example of how framing can affect how people think about a problem.

The International Mathematical Olympiad is a prestigious competition for students who are not yet in college. The competition asks students to solve difficult problems in mathematics, which can be helpful for outside inference.

00:55:00
The video discusses the mathematics olympiad, which is a competition where countries send six people to compete. It explains that, although the olympiad is popular in Russia, it is not as popular in the United States. It also discusses the importance of knowledge and skill in invention and innovation at a young age, and how this is a common theme in the olympiad.

01:00:00
Po-Shen Loh discusses the Russian system of mathematics education, which emphasizes rigorous deep education over the weaker student. He also talks about the psychological pressure that students feel when competing in mathematics olympiads. He believes that this system can produce some of the best minds in the world. Finally, Loh discusses his approach to mathematics teaching, which focuses on exams and not just problem-solving.

01:05:00
Lex Fridman, a mathematics professor, discusses how he prepares students for the international math Olympiad. He explains that each problem is worth seven points, and that the students' maximum score is six problems x 7 points = 42 points. The way the problems are scored is explained, and it is explained that the US delegation tries to negotiate the points a problem is worth. The process of grading the written solutions is described, and it is mentioned that the coaches are speaking different languages which makes it difficult to manipulate the students.

01:10:00
Po-Shen Loh describes how, as a mathematics student, he learned to solve problems by practicing and reading textbooks until he found proofs that were short and linear in the number of insights required. This process allows him to estimate the number of insights required to solve a problem, and whether it is a good idea to pursue it. Loh also describes how, when stuck on a problem, he relies on his intuition and tries different solutions to see if any of them lead to a solution.

01:15:00
This YouTube video features Professor Po-Shen Loh talking about how he learned to select good problems to work on in order to maximize the chance of success. He also mentions Jacob Fox, another esteemed mathematician who taught him a lot about how to approach problems. Professor Loh believes that mathematics is discovered, rather than invented, and that there are few, if any, truly novel ideas in the field.

01:20:00

02:00:00
In this video, Po-Shen Loh discusses the mathematics of the Math Olympiad, combinatorics, and contact tracing. He explains that the process of finding other agents and reaching out is a way of distributing the workload among a group, and that this is a problem because the giant agent will eventually absorb all the others. He suggests that systems like the internet might be able to create distributed knowledge bases in a more efficient way.

02:05:00
Po-Shen Loh talks about mathematics, math Olympiad, and contact tracing. He shares that much of the exciting work in this field was done in the 20th century, but much of the application will be in the 21st century. He then asks a ridiculous question, which leads into a discussion of Scott Aaronson's probability of p and p not equal to np. Aaronson once put this at three percent, but has since moved on to other projects. Loh shares that 42 has a powerful meme effect and is inspiring to many. He recommends reading books and watching movies that inspire and motivate him.
