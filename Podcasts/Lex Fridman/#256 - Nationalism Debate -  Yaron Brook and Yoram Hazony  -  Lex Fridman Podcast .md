Ayn Rand is introduced as a thinker who challenges empiricism by proposing that empirical evidence can be used to identify truths, even in the face of new information.

The difference is that the Constitution is written with the understanding that the government has a purpose, which is to protect individual rights.

The Constitution, in conjunction with the Declaration, set the groundwork for the American Revolution and the Civil War.
