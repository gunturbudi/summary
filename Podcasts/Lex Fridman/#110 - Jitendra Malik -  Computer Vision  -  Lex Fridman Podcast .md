Jitendra Malik, a professor at Berkeley, discusses the difficulty of computer vision and how it has been underestimated in the past. He explains that a large part of the human brain is devoted to visual processing and that, when looking at it from a neuroscience or psychology perspective, the problem becomes quite challenging.

00:05:00
Computer vision is a difficult task that requires a lot of understanding and common sense reasoning.

00:10:00
Jitendra Malik discusses the importance of computer vision in autonomous vehicles, and how it can be difficult to solve some of the more difficult driving tasks. He also talks about how perception blends into cognition and predicting the behavior of others.

00:15:00
Jitendra Malik discusses the importance of data in computer vision, explaining that currently computer vision systems require far more data than humans do in order to learn the same capabilities. He speculates that in the future, neural networks may be able to achieve the same level of expertise as humans through long-term accumulation of knowledge.

00:20:00
Jitendra Malik discusses the importance of computer vision in human development, and how it is broken down into different parts. He points out that the computational power of today's computers is comparable to that of the human brain, but that there is still a lot of work to be done in order to create real-world systems that are able to learn and understand the world.

00:25:00
Jitendra Malik discusses the goal of computer vision, how humans evolved to have this capability, and how it has evolved to become a more general problem solving tool. He also discusses how this problem is harder than it seems at first, and how the division between static and dynamic images is a starting point for many computer vision breakthroughs. He finishes by discussing how robotic vision is a more difficult problem to solve, and how the division between static and dynamic images might not be the deepest question to ask.

00:30:00
Jitendra Malik discusses how the computer vision community has had to make choices due to limitations in the past, and how these choices have implications for current research. He also previews future developments in video recognition.

00:35:00
Jitendra Malik gives a short history of computer vision, discussing how the technology has evolved over the years. He then discusses how long-term understanding of video requires learning schemas and goals intentionality, which is difficult to do using current technology. He suggests that we should focus on collecting data that resembles that of a child's experience, such as their linguistic and visual environment.

00:40:00
Jitendra Malik discusses the importance of being able to play with the data set or select what you're learning, and how this is important in breaking the correlation versus causation barrier. He also talks about the importance of real robotics and simulation environments, and how both are important in helping to build and refine causal models in children.

00:45:00
Computer vision researchers have been able to advance their ability to create realistic models of objects and physical interactions by using a combination of bottom-up and top-down image statistics. One of the students of the researcher discusses some of their recent work in the field.

00:50:00
Jitendra Malik discusses the importance of segmentation in computer vision, discusses how segmentation enables the recognition of objects without needing to name them or know their properties, and argues that humans achieve this ability through little to no supervision through the process of learning. He then proposes that the value of segmentation lies in its ability to create objects, and suggests that this may be a fundamental difference between it and other problems in computer vision.

00:55:00
The three "R's" of computer vision are Recognition, Reconstruction, and Reorganization. Recognition is the process of recognizing objects in an image, Reconstruction is the process of creating a model of the external world, and Reorganization is the process of finding the objects in the image.

01:00:00
Jitendra Malik discusses how the different parts of computer vision - segmentation, recognition, and reconstruction - are interconnected and how end-to-end learning, or "lifelong learning," is key to achieving successful results in the field.

01:05:00
Jitendra Malik discusses the relationship between vision and language, pointing out that vision is the ability to perceive objects, while language is the ability to communicate. He goes on to say that vision is more fundamental than language, and that it can be seen as either phylogenetic or ontogenetic. He discusses the significance of multimodal signals, and how they can be used for weak supervision.

01:10:00
Jitendra Malik discusses the development of human cognition, including the emergence of language. He argues that language is the hardest cognitive ability to achieve, and that there are many different abilities which are correlated. He concludes by discussing his favorite tasks in the manipulation domain.

01:15:00
Jitendra Malik discusses the various challenges involved in computer vision, including long-term 3D understanding. He suggests that artificial intelligence progress can be measured by how well it performs on tasks in the "real world."

One of the challenges in computer vision is that it is difficult to make accurate predictions without a good understanding of the 3D structure of the scene. Malik points to the long-form video understanding as an area where current technology is not up to par.

01:20:00
Jitendra Malik discusses the idea of computer vision, outlining the successions of visual experiences that a person goes through and how these enable the construction of an internal representation. He then talks about the importance of explaining computer vision systems, highlighting the fact that humans are not always able to understand or interact with these representations. He concludes the talk by stating that while humans may never achieve levels of intelligence equivalent to those of superhuman beings, neural networks will be able to create convincing stories that convince the user of their understanding.

01:25:00
Jitendra Malik discusses the progress made in computer vision and robotics in the last few decades, highlighting the work done in deep learning and convex optimization. He also discusses the potential for harmful effects from artificial intelligence in the future. He agrees with the interviewer that we need to be concerned about AI today, but does not believe that we need to worry about AGI in 10 or 20 years.

01:30:00
Jitendra Malik discusses the dangers of artificial intelligence, pointing out that while the technology has progressed greatly in recent years, it is still in its early stages and has yet to achieve the level of intelligence that is necessary for safe and effective use. He also warns of the potential for AI to be used to manipulate and control the population.

01:35:00
Jitendra Malik has spent a lot of time helping students develop a sense of what is a good problem to work on, and has a lot of experience in different fields of science. He has advised some of the biggest names in computer vision and AI.

01:40:00
Jitendra Malik discusses computer vision with Lex Fridman, discussing how psychology can help in developing better algorithms. Malik also discusses his experiences with Prince Mishkin and Dostoyevsky, and how beauty can help to save the world.
