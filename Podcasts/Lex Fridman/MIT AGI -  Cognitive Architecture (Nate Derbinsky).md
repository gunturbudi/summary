# Summary of MIT AGI: Cognitive Architecture (Nate Derbinsky)

The video discusses the cognitive architecture of MIT's AGI project, which uses a cognitive model of human memory to optimize task performance. The model is efficient, but requires approximations for certain memories due to their low activation or relevance. The forget policy achieves near-perfect accuracy by forgetting only those memories deemed not to be useful or recently used.
Nate Derbinsky discusses the idea of a cognitive architecture, which is a system designed to allow knowledge to be fused and processed in a more efficient way. He explains that there is currently no such system available, and that it would require the designer to impose constraints on the architecture in order to limit its memory and processing capabilities.

00:00:00
Nate Derbinsky discusses cognitive architecture, a research field that aims to create computers that exhibit human-level intelligence. He covers the historical context of the field, describes some of the systems currently available, and provides pointers for those interested in learning more.

00:05:00
In this video, Nate Derbinsky discusses how cognitive architectures are used in AI research, and how they differ from traditional machine learning models. He also gives an example of how cognitive architectures can be used to predict the difficulty level of a task, and how reinforcement learning can be used to improve performance.

00:10:00
The video discusses MIT's AGI project, which aims to create a cognitive architecture that can replicate the cognitive abilities of humans. Alan Newell, one of the project's founders, argued that cognitive architectures should be based on assumptions about how humans operate at different time scales. He also argued that progress in cognitive science is based on falsifying hypotheses, rather than confirming them.

00:15:00
The video discusses the work of MIT's "Cognitive Architecture" research group, which looks at how cognitive limitations (speed of operations, amount of memory, etc.) can be overcome by using a range of different approaches, including symbolic and perceptual representations, machine learning, and statistical analysis.

00:20:00
The video discusses MIT's AGI project, which focuses on building cognitive architectures that are true to human biological processes at a layer above. The project's ultimate goal is to create systems that can solve problems and exhibit cool artifacts. One of the project's recent additions is Sigma, a system that specializes in producing functional systems.

00:25:00
The video discusses how cognitive architectures, which are models of how humans think, can be used to create computer interfaces. One such model is the act-our-cognitive-architecture, which was developed by John Anderson and Christian. The video also discusses how predictions about human behavior can be made using cognitive architectures.

00:30:00
The Soraa cognitive architecture is a recent, efficient, and scalable cognitive architecture that focuses on human processing. It is developed at the University of Southern California by Paul Rosenbloom and John Laird. Soraa is different from other cognitive architectures in that it focuses on efficiency, and has been implemented on a variety of platforms, including real-time processors.

00:35:00
The video discusses MIT's AGI project, which focuses on cognitive architecture. The video also covers some of the project's applications, including a virtual human project and a game called Michigan Liars Dice.

00:40:00
This video introduces the MIT AGI project, which aims to understand how competition and creativity interact. The project has recently focused on learning how to play games using text-based descriptions and multimodal experience.

00:45:00
The MIT AGI Cognitive Architecture (Nate Derbinsky) is a model for understanding how research occurs in a group and how to make a system more efficient. This system has to be task independent, efficient, and useful to a wide variety of agents.

00:50:00
The video discusses the cognitive architecture of MIT's AGI project, which uses a cognitive model of human memory to optimize task performance. The model is efficient, but requires approximations for certain memories due to their low activation or relevance. The forget policy achieves near-perfect accuracy by forgetting only those memories deemed not to be useful or recently used.

00:55:00
The YouTube video discusses the MIT AGI project, which aimed to create a cognitive architecture that was 15 to 20 times faster than existing mobile robots. The project succeeded in achieving this goal by implementing a task-specific forgetting mechanism that allowed the system to perform well even when forgetting occurs.

01:00:00
This YouTube video explains how cognitive architecture, or the design of systems that mimic or surpass human intelligence, is still an open question. There is research being done on metacognition, which is the self-assessment of one's own state and processing. Some work has been done on the cognitive architecture, but it is still a growing field with many unanswered questions. The video recommends watching "humans" by the BBC, which is a show about what would happen if human-level AI were developed. The book " crystallize Smith's How to Build a Brain" is another recommended read.

The MIT AGI Cognitive Architecture is designed to efficiently process changes in the world, which is one of its core features. Another key feature of the architecture is its task-specific heuristics, which allows it to efficiently process different tasks.

01:10:00
The video discusses the cognitive architecture of MIT's AGI project, which is working on building a system that can remember complex information. The MIT project is using a variety of techniques to reduce the amount of memory needed to store this information, including using a rule-based system and storing information in short-term memory rather than long-term memory.

01:15:00
Nate Derbinsky discusses the cognitive architecture of MIT's AGI project, focusing on the role of forgetting in achieving efficient behavioral decision-making. He describes how the project's low-level cognitive architecture is always given a set of preferences for selecting actions, which is then pushed up to a higher level of knowledge in the agent's memory to form a plan for reaching a desired goal. He says there is no guarantee that this sequence will take the agent to the goal desired, but argues that this higher-level cognitive architecture is necessary for any task involving complex decision-making.

01:20:00
The cognitive architecture approach is a conceptual framework for thinking about artificial intelligence that is different from other approaches. Its strengths include its conceptual boldness, its ability to keep an eye on the ball, and its resilience in the face of failure. The biggest shortcomings of cognitive architecture are that it is rare for systems to achieve human-level intelligence, and that it is difficult to design a system that is generalizable to a large population.

01:25:00
The author discusses the challenges of building cognitive architectures and how they relate to multi-agent systems. He also mentions a study that used text corpora to predict human cognition.

01:30:00
Nate Derbinsky discusses the idea of a cognitive architecture, or a system designed to allow knowledge to be fused and processed in a more efficient way. There is currently no such system available, and it would require the designer to impose constraints on the architecture in order to limit its memory and processing capabilities.
