Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Jeremy Surrey discusses the challenges of democracy in America, pointing out the flaws in institutions like the Electoral College and the way in which the false reverence for institutions can hinder progress. He argues for a middle ground between burning down the system and accepting it as it is, using examples from American history.

00:05:00
Jeremi Suri discusses the importance of bringing an outsider perspective to institutions, and how this can be difficult when in a bubble. He also discusses the importance of historical perspective and how it can help reduce defensive attitudes and open up discussions.

00:10:00
Jeremi Suri discusses the importance of storytelling in politics and how it can be used to bring arguments to life and change people's opinions. He also discusses the importance of history and how it can help us learn more about more people and understand the events that have taken place in the past.

00:15:00
The American Civil War started because of the Founding Fathers' mixed views on slavery, and it continued because of the power of slave-owning aristocrats in the United States Parliament and the Supreme Court. Lincoln, the founder of the Republican Party, fought to free the slaves and open up the United States to free labor, free soil, and free men.

00:20:00
Jeremi Suri discusses the differences between the Union and Confederate armies, and how the Second Amendment plays a part in this. He also discusses the role of guns in American history, and how access to them has changed throughout the years.

00:25:00
Jeremi Suri discusses the idea of gun control in the context of the American Civil War, discussing that while giving guns to the populace may not result in robberies and assaults, it can help to reduce crime. He also discusses how, after the Civil War, many Southern soldiers brought their guns home and used them to intimidate former slaves.

00:30:00
Jeremi Suri discusses how slavery was a part of human civilization for thousands of years and how it was a requirement for the idea of "all men are created equal" in the founding of the United States. He argues that while many Americans in the 17th and 18th centuries believed in the idea of equality, slavery was a necessary part of that in order to maintain the status quo of white superiority.

00:35:00
Jeremi Suri discusses the American Civil War, discussing the importance of the founding documents and the struggles between the Union and Confederate States. Lincoln builds on the ideas of the founders and turns the Union's position into a defense of the core values of the country, ultimately leading to the victory of the Union.

00:40:00
Jeremi Suri discusses the American Civil War, the Founding Fathers, democracy, republicanism, and freedom of speech. He argues that democracy is not mob rule, that freedom of speech is a core tenet of American democracy, and that being of the People by the People for the People means accountability to the public.

00:45:00
Jeremi Suri discusses the importance of freedom of speech and how it should be exercised in a way that is respectful to others. He also discusses the importance of transparency in the editorial process of media outlets, and how this can help to prevent conspiracy theories from spreading.

00:50:00
Jeremi Suri argues that the failure of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter is due to their lack of transparency about their rules and the resulting lack of understanding of how their algorithms work. He also says that there is a tension within the gray area of these rules, which is the very process of democracy. He suggests that the solution to these issues is to remove content that is explicitly violent or sexual in nature from social media platforms.

00:55:00
Jeremi Suri discusses the effects of war on individuals and societies, highlighting the resilience of both Lincoln and Grant. He also discusses the dangers of war, specifically noting that it often leads to the emergence of hate groups.

01:00:00
The history of the Ku Klux Klan is explored in this video, which discusses the history of the KKK and its role in America's Civil War. Ulysses S. Grant is discussed, as he is a controversial figure because of his involvement with the KKK and his presidency. The author argues that, though much of the KKK's influence has diminished, its legacy remains present in American society.

01:05:00
Jeremi Suri discusses the idea that history can have an individual and a large-scale society effect on human interactions, and how he thinks it's important to explore controversial figures such as David Duke. He also recommends books on the KKK for those who want to understand them better.

01:10:00
Jeremi Suri discusses the Confederacy's General Robert E. Lee and his complicated legacy. He argues that Lee was a great general but his refusal to accept defeat at the end of the Civil War makes him a villain in the eyes of many.

01:15:00
The video discusses the idea that World War II is not a good example of a war to help us analyze history, and that the Civil War is a special case due to the continuing presence of leaders from the Confederate side. The author argues that the Civil War should have ended with a complete victory for the Union, and that the system implemented after the war (e.g. the ban on leaders from the Confederacy from ever serving in federal office again) is a flawed implementation of justice.

01:20:00
The end of the American Civil War is officially marked by the signing of the Appomattox Agreement, which allows Confederate soldiers to leave the battlefield with their firearms. Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, is later captured and not convicted, but there is no formal settlement. Abraham Lincoln's values and actions during the Civil War are discussed, including his efforts to emancipate the slaves, his use of the war to move the country forward morally, and his management of the international side of the conflict.

01:25:00
Johnson took over from Lincoln and had all the War Powers Lincoln had, which was not good because he didn't have a plan for who would take over if Lincoln died. Lincoln should have had a backup plan for who would take over in case Johnson was not capable.

01:30:00
Jeremi Suri discusses the problems that arose from the presidency of Abraham Lincoln, particularly in terms of his handling of the Civil War and his willingness to pardon Confederate leaders. He also argues that Lincoln would have been a better politician if he had held together his Republican coalition and empowered former slaves.

01:35:00
Jeremi Suri discusses the pros and cons of the Union winning the Civil War, and how it would have affected different groups of people. He also points out that, if the Confederacy had won, there would have been a separate country with a slavery-based economy.

01:40:00
Jeremi Suri discusses the historiography of the American Civil War, focusing on the role of the losers – the Southerners – in writing the post-war story. He discusses the need for humility from historians and the impact of recent movements to highlight historical hypocrisy.

01:45:00
Jeremi Suri discusses the similarities between Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln, and how both men had flaws. He goes on to say that one of Jefferson's flaws was that he was a terrible farmer, and that this shows how flawed his ideas were regarding slavery. However, despite this, the Declaration of Independence is still valuable. He also discusses the hypocrisy of some people who participate in cancel culture and condemn everything, while often engaging in similar behaviors themselves. Finally, he encourages people to take action, even if it is difficult, and to always remember that even the smallest act of kindness can make a difference.

01:50:00
In this video, Jeremi Suri discusses the history of white nationalism in the United States. He argues that there is a distinction between white supremacy, which is the belief that those with lighter skin are superior, and Christian nationalism, which is the presumption that it is not just your race but your Christian belief that determines your worth.

01:55:00
Jeremi Suri discusses the concept of Christian nationalism and how it differs from the views of Lincoln, who quotes scripture in a way that is not intended to create a Christian nation. The concept of Christian nationalism has been used to divide people and to hide the historical roots of racism.

02:00:00
In 1876, there was fraud in the election of Rutherford B Hayes, which caused the Democrats to lose. In 1888, Grover Cleveland lost to Benjamin Harrison despite winning the popular vote. In 1876-1896, there were a number of very close elections, with the losing side never being happy. In contrast, in recent years, there has been a high amount of fraud in U.S. elections, with both the Democrats and Republicans being unhappy with the results.

02:05:00
Jeremi Suri's book, Unbeaten: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, discusses Lincoln's electoral victory in 1860 despite being opposed by a large majority of the Southern population. He argues that the election was not fraudulent, but rather due to the complexity of the U.S. election system. He also discusses the possibility of modernizing voting systems to make them more user-friendly. His book is non-partisan, and his perspective on history is nonpartisan.

02:10:00
Jeremi Suri discusses his book "The Unfinished American Revolution: The Civil War in the Civil Rights Era" and how it tries to be non-partisan while also being critical of Donald Trump and white supremacy. He notes that it can be difficult to remain unbiased when writing history, but believes that everyone can learn from it.

02:15:00
Jeremi Suri discusses the use of the term "white supremacists" to describe Confederates, and how this language can be used inappropriately. He also discusses the need to be precise when using historical terms, and explains why he tries to avoid using words like "anti-semite." He challenges those who believe that America cannot be made better, and offers an example of something that he likes about Donald Trump.

02:20:00
Jeremi Suri discusses the psychology of presidents and how Joe Biden and Donald Trump differ in terms of their leadership styles. He also notes that there is a widespread desire for unification in the country and believes that Trump Derangement Syndrome may be a real condition.

02:25:00
Jeremi Suri discusses how it is easy for people to get hateful on the internet, how hate watching can be a productive way of expressing anger, and how disagreement can be a helpful tool.

02:30:00
The video discusses the January 6, 2017, storming of the US capital, which is viewed as a coup d'etat by Jeremi Suri. He argues that the intentions of the participants were not bad, but their lack of a good plan doomed their effort. He also discusses the possibility that President Trump would have refused to certify the election if the coup had succeeded.

02:35:00
Jeremi Suri argues that the President of the United States should have done more to protect members of Congress during the 2017-2018 Congressional recess, which was when members of Congress were being threatened. Suri also argues that the President should have focused more on the democratic process, rather than on his own political agenda.

02:40:00
Jeremi Suri discusses how he thinks the country can heal its divisions and how he tries to have conversations with people from all sides of the aisle. He also mentions that he has taken some friends out of his photos because they are no longer in his life as Republicans.

02:45:00
In this video, Jeremi Suri discusses the effects of partisanship and extremism on teenage behavior. He argues that universities should try to foster a more nuanced and complex discussion, instead of blindly following ideological dogma.

02:50:00

02:55:00
Jeremy Surry discusses the importance of the arts in integrating with other disciplines, and how this can be a tool for social change. He also discusses how social media can be used to reach a large audience, and how Abraham Lincoln was an advocate for giving people power.
