Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
In this interview, Bjarne Stroustrup discusses his journey as a programmer, starting with his first program written in college and his first programming language, Algol 60. He describes how he found Simula "absolutely great," teaching him that "you could have the sort of the problems of a program grow with size of the program rather than with the square of the size of program."

00:05:00
Bjarne Stroustrup discusses the history of programming languages, with a focus on the major breakthrough of Fortran. He discusses how this allowed for more portability and flexibility in writing code. He then talks about how Simula expanded on this idea by allowing for user-defined types.

00:10:00
In this interview, Bjarne Stroustrup discusses the history of programming languages, with a focus on his own work on C++. He talks about the key breakthrough of object-oriented programming, which was the ability to create new types, and how this has been a fundamental part of C++ from the beginning. He also discusses the importance of inheritance and runtime polymorphism in making code more manageable, and how these concepts have been central to his work on C++.

00:15:00
In the interview, Stroustrup discusses the importance of learning multiple programming languages, as each one can offer different insights and paradigms. He also mentions that when he was first learning C++, it was easier to pick up than it is today, as the language has become more complex.

00:20:00
In this excerpt, Bjarne Stroustrup talks about how he believes that C++ is the best language for writing high-performance code. He also talks about how he thinks that JavaScript is a good language for quickly churning out code.

00:25:00
In this interview, Bjarne Stroustrup discusses the origins of C++ and its focus on efficiency and reliability. He argues that safety and reliability must be considered at the system level, not just the individual code level, in order to be effective.

00:30:00
In this excerpt, Bjarne Stroustrup argues that the key to writing good code is simplification. He believes that code should be as simple as possible, and that by express things directly in code, we can make our programs more maintainable and easier to test.

00:35:00
In this podcast, Bjarne Stroustrup discusses how important it is for programmers to use their tools well in order to produce good code. He also talks about how static analysis can be used to help find errors in code.

00:40:00
In this podcast, Bjarne Stroustrup discusses the tension between abstraction and efficiency in programming, and how this tension is resolved in the C++ programming language. He also discusses the importance of static analysis and testing in ensuring the reliability of code.

00:45:00
In the interview, Bjarne Stroustrup discusses the design of C++, its relationship to other languages, and its implementations. He talks about how the language is designed to meet the "zero overhead" principle, and how this is achieved through the compilation process and the design of the features themselves. He also discusses how C++ is used in different application areas, and how small groups of people can work together to create successful programs.

00:50:00
In the podcast, Bjarne Stroustrup discusses the history of C++ and the reasons why there are multiple implementations of the language. He notes that the existence of multiple compilers puts pressure on developers to improve the language in various ways.

00:55:00
Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, explains in this interview how C++ was designed to be an extension of the C programming language with the addition of powerful tools for abstraction and code reuse. Stroustrup discusses the advantages of C++ over other languages, such as its efficiency and flexibility.

01:00:00
In the interview, Bjarne Stroustrup discusses the idea of vector and how it can be implemented efficiently in C++. He also talks about the benefits of using templates and how they can be used to generate efficient code.

01:05:00
Bjarne Stroustrup talks about how C++ code generation has always been ugly because of optimizations, and how this has made debugging difficult. He introduces the concept of "concepts", which puts constraints on the things that can be parameterized in a generic component like a sort function. This makes the code more readable and easier to debug.

01:10:00
Bjarne Stroustrup, the designer of C++, talks about the origins of the concept of concepts in the language. He discusses the rationale behind the decision to make concepts a part of C++, the challenges in doing so, and the eventual standardization of the feature.

01:15:00
In the early 1990s, Bjarne Stroustrup and a team of others attempted to standardize C++ under ISO rules. However, they were unsuccessful due to the language being too complex and difficult to use.

01:20:00
In this podcast, Bjarne Stroustrup discusses the process of standardizing the C++ programming language. He explains how the process works and how it has evolved over time. He also discusses the challenges of standardizing a language and the importance of consensus in the process.

01:25:00
In the interview, Bjarne Stroustrup discusses the history and inner workings of C++. He describes how the language has evolved over time, and how its features allow for clean and efficient code.

01:30:00
In this excerpt, Bjarne Stroustrup discusses the importance of philosophy in language design, and how constructors, destructors, and other features are essential to C++. He also talks about the need for a unified set of principles for programming languages.

01:35:00
In this excerpt, Bjarne Stroustrup discusses the differences between programming and machine learning, and how the two fields are related. He argues that machine learning is a much messier and less reliable field than programming, and that the two should be seen as separate entities.

01:40:00
In this interview, Bjarne Stroustrup discusses the design of C++ and its role in professional engineering. He also talks about his concerns with machine learning, and how difficult it is to get the interaction between machines and humans right.

01:45:00
Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, discusses how the language has evolved over the years and how it has been used to build countless systems that make the world a better place. He also talks about how he gets to see and learn about so many interesting things and meet so many interesting people through his work.
