00:35:00
Ariel Ekblaw, a researcher at SpaceX, discusses the challenges of fermenting food for long-duration deep space missions. They also discuss Sarah Walker's quest to define life and whether or not it can be outside of carbon-based life.

00:40:00
Ariel Ekblaw discusses the challenges of interstellar colonization and how music could be used to connect humans from different civilizations. She also mentions the Telematron, a microgravity percussion instrument designed by Sans Fish and Nicole Boulier.

00:45:00
Ariel Ekblaw discusses space colonization and self-assembling space megastructures with Lex Fridman. He notes that it takes some time to adjust to the physics of this world, and that radiation is a significant challenge for long-term space travel. He also discusses the challenges of long-term space travel and the effects of radiation on the human body.

00:50:00
Ariel Ekblaw, an architect, discusses the challenges of space colonization, including the need for reliable technology and food production. She believes that humans will be able to colonize Mars in the 2030s, but notes that there are many challenges ahead.

00:55:00
Ariel Ekblaw discusses the possibility of wars in space, and how technology can be used to help catalyze and accelerate human compassion.

01:00:00
Ariel Ekblaw discusses the importance of space exploration and its positive effects on society. She also discusses the Mit Space Exploration Initiative, which focuses on life in space and various other projects. One of these projects is the development of in-space manufacturing, which could help to alleviate conflicts on Earth.

01:05:00
Ariel Ekblaw discusses the challenges of designing systems that will allow humans to work alongside intelligent machines, and how technology is evolving to make this a possibility. She also mentions the movie "Hal 9000," which may not portray the relationship between astronauts and the HAL 9000 robot in a positive light.

01:10:00
Ariel Ekblaw, a young scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, discusses the challenges of human happiness in space, and how technological interventions may help to alleviate those problems. She also discusses the possibility of humans colonizing Mars in the future, and how married couples or single crew members may be the best option for psychological stability.

01:15:00
Ariel Ekblaw, a space entrepreneur, discusses the importance of commercial spaceflight and how it has empowered research at MIT. She also discusses the potential for NASA and MIT to collaborate more and how affordable spaceflight has become.

01:20:00
Ariel Ekblaw, a space scientist, discusses the difficulties of space colonization and the importance of inspiring young people with the dream of going to space. She also discusses a project by two MIT students, Manway Sompong and Somu Ratna, that is inspired by a Buddhist mandala and tries to grow plants in space.

01:25:00
