02:35:00
Karl Deisseroth discusses how the concept of the "spectrum" can be a useful way of categorizing people, noting that some people who are socially and occupationally successful do not have a disorder, but that the concept can be a useful tool for pigeonholing people. He also discusses the idea of eye contact, noting that it can be both interesting and creepy and that it's okay to be weird.

02:40:00
Karl Deisseroth discusses depression, schizophrenia, and psychiatry, discussing how the symptoms of each can be manifestations of a break from reality. He speculates that schizophrenia is an extremely genetically determined condition, with around one percent of the human population experiencing it worldwide.

Karl Deisseroth, a professor of psychiatry and neurology at Yale University, discusses how the "inner subjective sense" is created by electrical activity in the brain. He argues that, even if neurons are spread all over the world and the same stimulus is provided, the individual would still experience the subjective sense because it is "exactly the same as the previous situation." This paradox challenges the philosophical concept of the "internal subjective state."

03:10:00
Karl Deisseroth discusses the possibility of consciousness spanning multiple organisms, the dissociation experiment, how ketamine and pcp can cause oscillations in the brain, and the possibility of a theory of everything.
