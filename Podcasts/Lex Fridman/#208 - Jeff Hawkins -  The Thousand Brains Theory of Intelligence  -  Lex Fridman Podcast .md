# Summary of Jeff Hawkins: The Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence | Lex Fridman Podcast #208

Jeff Hawkins discusses his "Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence," which suggests that the brain is composed of thousands of individual brains that each contribute to intelligence. He argues that this theory is based on the principle that intelligence is a composite phenomenon, and that the brain is just one component of this complex web. Hawkins discusses the implications of this theory, and how it can help us to better understand the nature of intelligence and human collaboration.
Jeff Hawkins discusses the idea that artificial intelligence could potentially be smarter than humans, and argues that this is not because the machine is based on intelligence from the neocortex, but because the machine has a "brain intelligence system" which includes other parts of the brain not usually associated with intelligence. He also disagrees with Elon Musk and Stuart Russell's worries about existential threats from artificial intelligence, arguing that such threats are unfounded.
Jeff Hawkins is a leading figure in the field of artificial intelligence, and in this video he discusses his work on the Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence. This theory posits that intelligence is the product of the combined effort of many individual minds, and Hawkins believes that the progress of human civilization is propelled forward by a small number of individuals who are working towards a better future.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
In his new book, "A Thousand Brains," neuroscientist Jeff Hawkins explores the structure, function and origin of intelligence in the human brain. He argues that some of the unique aspects of human consciousness - such as the ability to experience love and suffering - may be the only things that separate us from other intelligent alien civilizations.

Jeff Hawkins discusses the idea that the human brain is composed of thousands of individual brains, each of which contributes to intelligence. He explains that this theory is based on the principle that intelligence is a composite phenomenon, and that the brain is just one component of this complex web. Hawkins discusses the implications of this theory, and how it can help us to better understand the nature of intelligence and human collaboration.

00:10:00
The Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence is the idea that the brain contains tens of thousands of independently functioning models of the world. These models are coordinated by voting connections, and we are only consciously aware of the results of these votes.

00:15:00
Jeff Hawkins discusses the idea of intelligence as a model-building ability. He explains that we learn to understand the world by interacting with it, through movement and observation. Our brain employs reference frames to predict future events, and intelligence is fundamental to this process.

00:20:00
Jeff Hawkins discusses his theory that intelligence is fundamentally a process of predicting the world around us. He argues that, since all sense inputs are first passed through a prediction, intelligence is simply a different way to see prediction. He also discusses the mechanisms by which we build a model of the world and the evolution of intelligence.

00:25:00
Jeff Hawkins lays out the theory that animals, including humans, use grid cells and place cells to map their surroundings.grid cells and place cells are specific neurons in the brain that help with navigation and learning new information. Evidence is mounting that grid cells and place cells also play a role in intelligence, as they are found in areas that are important for reasoning and problem solving. The theory suggests that animals have a generic learning algorithm that was repackaged into a more compact form, leading to the development of the neocortex. If this hypothesis is correct, it would mean that the brain is essentially a model-building machine, and that intelligence is essentially a product of evolution.

00:30:00
Jeff Hawkins discusses the thousand brains theory of intelligence, which holds that humans and other animals rely on a similar, grid-like mechanism to understand the world. He explains that while the theory is based on evidence, it is not the goal of his research to understand the neocortex.

00:35:00
Jeff Hawkins discusses the idea that most of our predictions are occurring inside individual neurons, and how this manifests itself in neural tissue. He argues that this evidence supports the idea that humans are special in the hierarchy of complexity in the universe.

00:40:00
Jeff Hawkins' Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence postulates that every cortical column in the human brain is capable of making predictions. These predictions are then used to generate different neural representations. The theory also explains how reference frames are necessary for making predictions and how the older parts of the brain, the hippocampus and the antorano cortex, are responsible for establishing and maintaining reference frames.

00:45:00
Jeff Hawkins discusses his Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence, which postulates that intelligence is not just a product of the number of neurons in one's brain, but also the way these neurons are organized. According to Hawkins, the same mechanism that allows us to model objects in our environment hierarchically also allows us to model concepts hierarchically. This reveals that higher level concepts are not entirely different from lower level concepts, but are instead built upon the same principles.

00:50:00
Jeff Hawkins discusses his "Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence" which suggests that the brain is a complex machine that is both an engineering marvel and the result of evolution. He predicts that robotics and artificial intelligence will eventually merge, and that the algorithms used to control robots will be the same as those used in the brain.

00:55:00
Jeff Hawkins, a computer scientist and co-founder of Google, discusses the potential implications of increasingly intelligent artificial intelligence. He argues that while AI may not be "smart" in the sense that humans are, it will still have a profound impact on humanity because it is fundamentally a learning system.

01:00:00
Jeff Hawkins discusses the finitude of life and how we learn to think about it. He goes on to say that it is useful to have the urgency of mortality in order to be motivated to achieve goals. He also discusses the idea that a machine could be conscious, and not worry about it, but get excited about it.

01:05:00
Jeff Hawkins discusses the idea that an intelligent machine could potentially be smarter than humans, and argues that this is not because the machine is based on intelligence from the neocortex, but because the machine has a "brain intelligence system" which includes other parts of the brain not usually associated with intelligence. He also disagrees with Elon Musk and Stuart Russell's worries about existential threats from artificial intelligence, arguing that such threats are unfounded.

01:10:00
Jeff Hawkins discusses the potential for artificial intelligence to create existential risks for humanity, focusing on the threat of self-replication. He argues that self-replication is the main existential risk we face and that we need to be careful about creating intelligent machines that can replicate on their own.

01:15:00
Jeff Hawkins argues that intelligent machines won't necessarily be a bad thing because they will help us regulate riskier aspects of our lives.

01:20:00
Jeff Hawkins discusses the difficulties of merging human minds with artificial ones, and the potential for future technologies that would make this possible.

01:25:00
Jeff Hawkins talks about the Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence, which states that each individual's brain is basically equal to all the other brains in the universe. He argues that, because the internet has made our lives better in so many ways, a similar outcome will be achieved with the advent of artificial intelligence, which will make us smarter and smarter together as a collective. However, there are concerns about what might happen if we create machines that are smarter than humans, as we may end up destroying our civilizations.

01:30:00
Jeff Hawkins discusses the idea that intelligent life may have evolved on Earth before, and that we may be able to preserve our knowledge by sending satellites around the sun to archive it. He also talks about the idea that if humans destroy ourselves, another intelligent species might come along and learn from our mistakes.

01:35:00
Jeff Hawkins discusses the possibility of intelligent beings broadcasting signals that could be detected by civilizations millions of years in the future. He argues that studying these signals is a necessary part of the study of intelligence, and that humans may not be the only intelligent species that exists.

01:40:00
Jeff Hawkins talks about his theory that the brain is a distributed system, and how complex it might be in 100 years. He worries about some of the complexities of the theory, but is still optimistic that it will be figured out.

01:45:00
Jeff Hawkins discusses the Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence, which suggests that the brain is initially messy and complex, but that there are certain structures that are consistent across different forms of intelligence. He also discusses the potential for artificial intelligence to surpass human intelligence, and mentions that humans are prone to false beliefs.

01:50:00
Jeff Hawkins discusses the idea that humans are inherently prone to false beliefs due to their limited understanding of how their own brain works. He recommends that everyone learn about how their brain works in order to increase their skepticism and understanding of reality.

01:55:00
Jeff Hawkins discusses the possibility that string theory may be true and that if so, humans may never understand reality as it exists in other dimensions. He also discusses the potential for intelligent machines, and how current technology is leading to new ways of implementing these principles.

02:00:00
Jeff Hawkins discusses the principle of sparsity in the brain, which suggests that most neurons are active at any given time and that the connectivity between them is sparse. He explains how this principle can be applied to existing deep learning networks to make them more robust and fast, and how it can be used to train robots to be more efficient and successful. He concludes by giving advice to high school and college students on finding a career that they are passionate about, and emphasizing that passion is a prerequisite for success.

02:05:00
Jeff Hawkins talked about how he became interested in intelligence and how his passion for the topic led him to put aside his dreams of becoming a neuroscientist and instead focus on thinking about how to solve the puzzle of intelligence. He shared that when he was 22 and reading the September issue of Scientific American, he realized that there was something wrong with the current understanding of the brain, and that there was a lot of data that needed to be organized and thought about differently in order to improve our understanding. He said that, even though his dreams of becoming a neuroscientist may have been deferred, he is still able to find joy in the smallest things and is grateful for the opportunities life has given him.

02:10:00
Jeff Hawkins talks about his work on artificial intelligence and how love plays a role in the human condition. He also discusses his legacy and how he hopes people remember his work and book.

02:15:00
Jeff Hawkins discusses the Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence, which posits that intelligence is the product of the combined effort of a large number of individual minds. He believes that the progress of human civilization is not linear, but instead is propelled by a small number of individuals who are working towards a better future.
