Regina Barzilay discusses her experience reading books that have had a profound impact on her life journey, specifically those that have changed how she views the scientific process. She notes that, while books are a major source of knowledge for her, her interactions with people outside of academia also play an important role in shaping her worldview.

00:05:00
Regina Barzilay discusses how personality is more important than ideas in the development of scientific breakthroughs, and how computer science has benefitted from applying this understanding to medicine. She also discusses the challenges of understanding human biology and the current state of cancer treatments.

00:10:00
In this video, Regina Barzilay describes how she has changed her perspective on deep learning and cancer diagnosis and treatment since her diagnosis in 2014. She recalls how her graduate students and other colleagues had encouraged her to continue working on deep learning projects, but she eventually realized that there was more she could do to help those affected by cancer. She also reflects on how her experience with cancer has changed her perspective on life, and she shares her thoughts on how deep learning could be used more effectively to address problems such as cancer diagnosis and treatment.

00:15:00
Regina Barzilay discusses the importance of deep learning for cancer diagnosis and treatment, and how it can help to improve the outcomes for patients. She notes that while cancer is one of the diseases that can be cured with early detection, it is still a difficult problem to solve. She believes that machine learning will play a crucial role in helping to detect cancer earlier, and in predicting the outcome for patients.

00:20:00
Regina Barzilay discusses deep learning's potential for cancer diagnosis and treatment. She discusses the challenges of gathering large data sets and the role of machine learning in this area.

00:25:00
Regina Barzilay discusses deep learning approaches for cancer diagnosis and treatment. She says that if you go through all the required steps and have the necessary approvals, you can access the data. However, if you yourself are a deep learning researcher, you may not be aware of the many challenges involved in accessing this data. Barzilay discusses possible solutions to these challenges, including technical and societal solutions. She notes that if there is a way for patients to control how their data is used for research, it would be a game changer.

00:30:00
Regina Barzilay, a computer scientist, discusses the potential for patients to own their data, which could help them move between hospitals and doctors if information is not available.

00:35:00
Regina Barzilay explains how deep learning can be used to diagnose and treat cancer. She notes that between 40 and 50 percent of women have dense breasts, and that this information can impact a patient's risk of developing the disease. Regina suggests that patients, doctors, hospitals, and policymakers all need to be convinced of the benefits of deep learning in order to make the algorithm more widely adopted. However, she notes that there is no single answer to this question, and that success will come from a variety of sources.

00:40:00
Regina Barzilay discusses deep learning techniques for cancer diagnosis and treatment, highlighting the importance of drug design in this field. She explains that high throughput screening is a common method used to identify compounds with desired activity, but that machine learning can be used to improve the efficiency of this process.

00:45:00
Regina Barzilay is a chemist who has developed deep learning algorithms for cancer diagnosis and treatment. The algorithms are based on domain knowledge and are effective, but expensive and time-consuming to use.

00:50:00
Regina Barzilay discusses her work in natural language processing, deep learning, and machine translation. She talks about how the field has progressed in recent years, and how linguists have had to change their approach in order to keep up with deep learning advances. She also mentions that there is still much progress to be made in this area, and that there are many areas where deep learning can help, even if it doesn't understand language the same way humans do.

00:55:00
Regina Barzilay discusses deep learning for cancer diagnosis and treatment. She notes that while the technology is advancing rapidly, we still don't understand what's going on in the brain during language processing, and that this is a limitation of current machine translation systems. She also discusses the potential for machine-human conversations, noting that while it's possible to build a successful training set, it would be difficult to have a conversation with a machine that's understanding and nuanced.

01:00:00
Regina Barzilay discusses how machine learning is being used to improve cancer diagnosis and treatment, and how humans are still far from achieving superhuman intelligence. She believes that the progress made so far is impressive, and predicts that the future of AI will be even more exciting.

01:05:00
Regina Barzilay discusses the potential for artificial intelligence and technology to affect our intelligence, and shares her experiences with teaching a machine learning class for the first time. She notes that many students struggle with the basics of machine learning, and suggests that this might be because their backgrounds do not enable them to understand it.

01:10:00
Regina Barzilay discusses the importance of finding an area of research that is important to oneself, and the difficulty of doing so when surrounded by others who are more focused on fitting in and following the crowd. She encourages students interested in pursuing a career in machine learning to start by focusing on an area of research that is important to them, and to be patient in their learning process.

01:15:00
Regina Barzilay discusses how deep learning can be used to diagnose and treat cancer. She also discusses how books can be used to ask questions and gain knowledge.
