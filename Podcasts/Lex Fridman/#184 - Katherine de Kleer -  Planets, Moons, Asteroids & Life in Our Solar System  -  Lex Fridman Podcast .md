# Summary of Katherine de Kleer: Planets, Moons, Asteroids & Life in Our Solar System | Lex Fridman Podcast #184

In this video, Katherine de Kleer discusses the different types of objects in our solar system, including moons, planets, asteroids, and comets. She also discusses the importance of having a precise definition for these objects so that discussions about them don't become bogged down in romanticism. De Kleer notes that there are many fascinating objects out there that we currently cannot study in detail, but that we can learn a lot from flybys.
Katherine de Kleer is an astrophysicist who studies the atmospheres of planets and moons. In this podcast, she discusses the habitability of different planets and moons, the possibility of aliens visiting Earth, and the dangers of an asteroid hitting Earth. She also talks about how we can explore the solar system using robots, and the recent discovery of objects coming from outside our solar system.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Catherine de Kleer, a professor of planetary science and astronomy at Caltech, talks about Pluto being no longer a planet and the process by which it was reclassified. She also discusses the different ways in which planets can be categorized, and how the definition of a planet may change over time.

00:05:00
In this YouTube video, Katherine de Kleer discusses the different types of objects in our solar system, including moons, planets, asteroids, and comets. She also discusses the importance of having a precise definition for these objects so that discussions about them don't become bogged down in romanticism. De Kleer notes that there are many fascinating objects out there that we currently cannot study in detail, but that we can learn a lot from flybys.

00:10:00
Katherine de Kleer discusses the various tools that are available to astronomers to study planets and moons in detail, such as telescopes and orbiters.

00:15:00
Katherine de Kleer discusses the different types of heat sources that can generate volcanoes on Earth and moons in the outer Solar System, how tidal heating affects planetary orbits, and how Europa's subsurface ocean may be habitable.

00:20:00
In this video, Katherine de Kleer discusses the differences between Io and Earth's volcanoes, as well as the various gases that are released. Io's atmosphere is made predominantly of sulfur dioxide, which makes breathing difficult, and the radiation environment is very bad due to the planet's close proximity to Jupiter's magnetic field.

00:25:00
Katherine de Kleer discusses the different types of volcanism on different planets in our solar system, and how they are different in terms of potential to destroy human civilization. She also discusses Europa, one of the moons of Jupiter, and how it may have an ice shell beneath the surface ocean that would make it a good candidate for life.

00:30:00
The author discusses the differences between the possibility of life on Europa, Saturn's moon Enceladus, and Jupiter's moon, Titan. He discusses the potential for life on each moon and their potential for being observed. He also mentions the potential for humans to colonize Enceladus and Titan if the conditions are right.

00:35:00
Katherine de Kleer discusses the possibility of life on other planets, how rare Earth is, and how little is currently known about the subject. She says that while the Drake equation is being better understood, there are still many unknowns about alien civilizations. She believes that there is a very small chance that life exists elsewhere in the universe, and that the saddest part is that we may never know for sure.

00:40:00
Katherine de Kleer discusses the possible existence of intelligent alien civilizations, how we ourselves are self-obsessed and would not be able to detect them even if they were right in front of us, and why she believes that bacteria would be the first form of intelligent life we would encounter. She then discusses her favorite planet outside of Earth, which is Iowa.

00:45:00
Katherine de Kleer discusses the planets in the solar system, how much is still unknown about them, and her skepticism towards claims of life on Venus. She talks about the power of humor and how it can be used to spread positive messages, before introducing Elon Musk and his plan to colonize Mars.

00:50:00
Katherine de Kleer discusses the challenges of colonizing Mars, including the need for technology to create self-sustaining colonies and the risk of death. She speculates that the high allergy levels in Austin, Texas may be because she was raised in the Soviet Union, where insect farming was an important means of food production.

00:55:00
Katherine de Kleer discusses the difference between Earth and other planets in regards to their tectonic plates, the existence of gas plumes on Earth, and the beauty of molten lava. She also mentions how plate tectonics makes Earth unique in the solar system, and how Io does not have plate tectonics.

01:00:00
Katherine de Kleer discusses the atmosphere, plate tectonics, and the role they play in the habitability of a planet. She also discusses the possibility of aliens visiting Earth and what they would see.

01:05:00
Katherine de Kleer discusses the different weather patterns on different planets and moons in our solar system. She explains how these patterns can be used to understand the interior of the planet or moon.

01:10:00
Astrophysicists study the atmospheres of planets and moons in order to understand how the bodies interact with their environments. Titan's atmosphere is particularly complex, and predicting how it will respond to changes is difficult. Asteroids are classified as either ancient objects that have remained the same throughout the solar system's history, or remnants of planets that were destroyed by collisions.

01:15:00
Katherine de Kleer discusses the different types of asteroids and what questions to ask when studying them. Asteroids can be studied in detail by analyzing their composition and surface features, but it is still unclear what the asteroids are made of and what their surfaces are like.

01:20:00
Katherine de Kleer discusses the dangers of an asteroid hitting Earth, and how we may be able to prevent it. She also talks about the SpaceX rockets that have successfully landed on Mars.

01:25:00
Katherine de Kleer discusses how asteroids, moons, planets, and life in our solar system can be explored using robots, and how the recent discovery of objects coming from outside our solar system is amazing.

01:30:00
Katherine de Kleer discusses the possibility that an alien object is behind the acceleration of a moon out of the solar system. She notes that there are two plausible explanations for the object's behavior, both of which fit well within our understanding of how objects in space work. While she cannot rule out the possibility that the object is alien space junk, she believes that the most likely explanation is that it is a chunk of ice from a failed solar system that was ejected by the gravitational force of a larger body.

01:35:00
The video discusses the possibility of extraterrestrial life and discusses how the scientific method can sometimes crush out evidence that suggests something much bigger is happening. It also discusses the lead designer of the iPhone, Johnny Ive, who said that when he has an "origins of an idea," he does not tell Steve Jobs because Jobs would usually "trample all over it."

01:40:00
Katherine de Kleer discusses her views on the scientific method and its inherent skepticism, as well as the power of speculation in science. She recommends some of her favorite books, all of which are difficult to read.

01:45:00
The three books mentioned by the interviewee are Pale Fire by Vladimir Nabokov, The Duino Elegies by Rainer Maria Rilke, and Rookie by Don DeLillo. All of these books are difficult to read, but they are worth it for the intellectual challenge they offer. The author feels that loneliness is a theme that is undervalued and that ai systems could help us explore this aspect of our lives more fully.

01:50:00
The writer named Olga Grisham Grushin wrote a book called "The Dream Life of Sukhinov" which chronicles the life of a Russian father who slowly loses his mind. She advises a young person today to find an area of life where everything is exciting.

01:55:00
Catherine De Kleer discusses the various planets and moons in our solar system, as well as the possibility of life on some of them. She thanks Fundrise, Blinkist, and MagicSpoon for their support of the podcast, and quotes Carl Sagan on the potential for discoveries still to be made about Titan.
