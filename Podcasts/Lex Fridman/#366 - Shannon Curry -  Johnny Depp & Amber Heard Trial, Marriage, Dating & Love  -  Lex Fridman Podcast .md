In this section of the video, Shannon Curry discusses contempt and its harmful effects on relationships. She explains that contempt is when one partner looks at the other from a superior position, usually shown through eye-rolling, name-calling, mimicry, and other forms of belittlement. She notes that contempt can be abusive, but most people have engaged in it at some point in their relationship. However, even lower levels of contempt, like eye-rolling, can be the biggest predictor of a split. Dr. Curry also discusses the concept of romantic love and its biological basis, explaining that the chemicals pumped in the brain during the early stages of a relationship cannot be sustained forever. She argues that the feeling of love based on these chemicals is not a solid foundation for a long-term relationship, as it will naturally fade over time. Instead, she believes factors like shared experiences, mutual support, and practical considerations are more important for building a healthy, long-lasting relationship.

00:05:00
In this section, the importance of building and maintaining a long-lasting relationship is discussed based on the Gottman Method of couples therapy. Shannon Curry, a therapist specializing in this method, explains that implementing a set of skills, such as following the 'five to one ratio' (having five positive interactions for every one negative interaction), paying attention to your partner's bids for connection and affection, and ensuring that your partner's needs are met to build a successful relationship. Additionally, partners need to understand the unique needs of their significant other and adapt to their style of connection to gain satisfaction in the relationship. Finally, an example of a subtle act of kindness, such as sending a text acknowledging another's stress, can demonstrate care and concern for a partner's well-being.

00:10:00
In this section, Shannon Curry discusses common ways relationships fail that she has observed during therapy. She mentions the "Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse" identified by the government, which are behaviors that are highly predictive of divorce in couples. The first of the Four Horsemen is criticism, where people assume their perspective is the only valid one and tell their partner what is wrong with them. This is followed by defensiveness, making excuses or turning the blame around, not accepting responsibility and not validating the partner's feelings. The other two are contempt and stonewalling, which are even more disastrous for relationships.

00:15:00
In this section, Shannon Curry talks about the three Horsemen of the relationship apocalypse: criticism, stonewalling, and contempt. Criticism is a plea to be loved and is often used by women to raise issues verbally, which can lead to stonewalling from men. Stonewalling happens when one feels flooded and can't see any way to make the situation better. Contempt is the most damaging Horseman and involves mocking, name-calling, and imitating one's partner to diminish them. Instead of focusing on partners' flaws, Curry emphasizes the importance of wearing rose-colored glasses to recognize each other's strengths and unique qualities, which could help relationships to thrive.

00:20:00
In this section, Shannon Curry discusses dynamics in relationships and how they can both limit and enable successful relationships. According to research, gay couples tend to be gentler with one another during conflict discussions. When working with straight couples, she acts like a referee or ski coach and directs them to do short turns before intervening. Shannon also notes that the drama and tension portrayed in Hollywood films is not required for a passionate, lifelong romance. Instead, she suggests continually uncovering new layers with your partner through asking questions and being curious. Shannon recommends turning conversations into a quiz with your partner and asking questions like "what is my partner's fondest, as-of-yet unrealized life dream." These types of conversations can lead to feeling close and connected with your partner.

00:25:00
In this section, the guest, Shannon Curry, discusses the key to a successful relationship, including attunement, loyalty, and handling each other with care. She emphasizes the importance of the "us against the world" feeling where neither partner talks badly about the other and they work together as a team. Couples who have been together for a long time and still give each other compliments and are considerate to one another are typically the ones who have figured out how to work things out in a delicate relationship. Furthermore, the Gottman research showed the importance of processing conflicts and different interventions that could be helpful based on the type of conflict the couple is experiencing.

00:30:00
In this section, Shannon Curry talks about a method developed by psychologist Tai Tashiro that can help people find a partner they can stay with for the rest of their lives. Tashiro's research showed that only 35% of married people are actually happy. He found that the couples who were happy tended to rate their partners higher in three different traits: conscientiousness, kindness, and emotional stability. Conscientiousness includes being smart, attentive, and motivated to meet their partner's needs. Curry explains that understanding these traits and learning how to validate your partner's feelings can help improve future disagreements and make your relationship more successful.

00:35:00
In this section, Shannon Curry discusses the three traits to look for in a partner to have a successful long-term relationship. The first trait is conscientiousness, which means having a partner who is reliable and dependable. The second trait is emotional stability, meaning a partner who is generally happy and not emotionally unstable. The third trait is moderate adventurousness, not too high, as too much novelty-seeking can cause neglect in the relationship. Curry believes that these traits are things that one can work on, and self-awareness is key to personal growth and living a better life.

00:40:00
In this section, Shannon Curry discusses the importance of sex in successful relationships, stating that everyone has different levels of sexual satisfaction. She mentions that sex can bond couples together and create a rush of oxytocin, but its absence is not necessarily detrimental to relationships. She also talks about the topic of infidelity and how different couples deal with it, including those who are open about having sexual relationships with others, those who tolerate affairs as long as they are not in their face, and those who use sex as part of their conflict resolution process. Curry notes that radical honesty can be complicated and even destructive, and that what is considered to be honest can vary depending on the individual and their current state of mind.

00:45:00
In this section, Shannon Curry discusses the topic of honesty in relationships, specifically regarding disclosing past sexual partners or infidelity. While some individuals may believe that being honest about past experiences is empowering and enriching to a relationship, others view it as anti-romantic and prefer to leave the past unmentioned. In regards to infidelity, Curry suggests that holding onto the burden of guilt rather than unloading it onto a partner is the more ethical and kind choice, and can prevent further harm and trauma. Although some individuals prioritize truth over everything else, Curry suggests that kindness and doing no further harm should be the ultimate hierarchy.

00:50:00
In this section, clinical and forensic psychologist Shannon Curry discusses the concept of truth versus loyalty and how people's opinions on the matter can vary. She also touches on the topic of open relationships, sharing her observations on couples who practice polyamory and how their experiences differ based on their level of experience. Curry then talks about her experience testifying in the high-profile Johnny Depp and Amber Heard trial, admitting to feeling scared given the stakes and the large platform. Ultimately, she was able to do her job well despite feeling terror and anxiety.

00:55:00
In this section, Shannon Curry explains her role as a forensic psychologist in the Depp-Heard trial, in which she served as an expert witness based on a psychological evaluation of one of the parties. As an expert witness, she provided a report to the court with her findings and then testified as to what her findings were. Curry also discusses the pressure and precision required when testifying in court, as well as the fascinating nature of the personality assessment test, MMPI-2. The test comprises 567 yes or no questions and has a complex output that yields insights into an individual's unique personality traits.

01:00:00
In this section, Shannon Curry discusses the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2), a personality test used in forensic contexts. The test consists of thousands of random questions, making it difficult for test-takers to predict the outcome or cheat. The test has validity scales that help understand how test-takers are approaching the test, such as whether they are tired, responding randomly, or deceiving themselves. There are also 10 clinical scales and code types that provide a nuanced and defining picture of a person's personality, although the test does not look for strength. Proctoring the test is easy, and the test is challenging to beat due to its well-designed questions.

01:05:00
In this section, Shannon Curry discusses the limitations of personality assessments like the most researched and widely used one in the world, explaining how it is just a part of the puzzle and not definitive. She acknowledges that there is no one perfect test to measure personality, but with advancements in AI, more data on behavior could be collected for improving lifestyle and relationships. Curry goes on to explain personality classifications in the DSM-5 and the cluster B, which involves histrionic personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, and antisocial personality disorder. She also suggests that a more Spectrum-based approach could be used to describe personality disorders rather than just categorizing individuals into a cluster, which could be more accurate, especially with the overlap between these disorders. Finally, she explains borderline personality disorder as a disorder of emotional dysregulation and impulse control, while histrionic personality disorder is the least favored label in her opinion due to its controversial history and misogynistic undertones.

01:10:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the histrionic personality disorder, which is characterized by emotional instability, dramatics, and attention-seeking behavior. People with this disorder have an intense fear of abandonment, and their frantic attempts to avoid it can be harmful to themselves and others. Unlike borderline personality disorder, the primary motivation for those with histrionic personality disorder is to seek attention, and they may manipulate situations to get it. There is evidence to support a genetic basis for borderline personality disorder, and some people with this disorder may report no childhood trauma or difficulty. The speaker believes that biopsychosocial factors contribute to the development of these personality disorders.

01:15:00
In this section, the conversation turns to the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard trial and the raw recordings of their interactions that were presented. The topic of recording one's partner and how it could be useful in providing insight into how we present ourselves in private is discussed. The benefits of recording couples therapy sessions to help clients see their behaviors and reactions are also mentioned. The conversation then shifts to the use of code types, specifically the 3-6 code type, in forensic psychology and the importance of understanding the legal psycho legal questions when providing diagnoses in such cases.

01:20:00
In this section, forensic psychologist Shannon Curry discusses the process of conducting a personal injury evaluation and the importance of obtaining collateral data and records to determine a person's functioning before and after an alleged injury. She also discusses the use of psychological tests like the MMPI-2 and how it can provide nuanced information about a person's personality, but it should not be used alone to diagnose someone or determine their truthfulness. Curry also reflects on how the trial strengthened her abilities and challenged her intellectually, but it demanded so much of her time that it pulled her away from her typical forensic work and practice.

01:25:00
In this section, forensic psychologist Shannon Curry reflects on the never-ending academic and professional challenges that come with her line of work, which can sometimes feel like taking giant board exams again and again. On top of her forensic work, which involves forensic reports and citations, she owns a clinic where she provides therapy to clients, some of whom reach out to her when they're in crisis years later, making it hard to separate her professional therapy relationship from the bond she has formed with them. Curry admits that she needs to slow down, and the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard case reminded her of the feeling of pushing herself to do something she wasn't sure she was capable of but piling that on top of running a business and trying to be perfect at all of them is not healthy. Despite these challenges, Curry cherishes the opportunity to work on this case and run her practice and wouldn't have it any other way.

01:30:00
In this section of the Lex Fridman Podcast, Shannon Curry discusses the stress of being in the public eye during the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard trial, where she testified as an expert witness on domestic violence, and how she was unprepared for the level of scrutiny and attention it brought. Curry also talks about PTSD in the context of working with veterans, explaining that while traumatic stress is normal after something traumatic happens, PTSD is a longer-standing condition that can significantly impair a person's life. She discusses the landscape of psychological sufferings that veteran soldiers go through and the different factors that can influence whether someone develops PTSD or not. She also touches upon the path to healing for soldiers who have PTSD, highlighting how the military has set up a framework of care for their active-duty personnel.

01:35:00
In this section, Shannon Curry talks about the mental health services provided by the US Department of Defense (DoD) to duty service members. Curry praises the DoD for being ahead of the game in the early 1900s when they brought animal-assisted therapy into their hospitals. Curry goes on to add that the DoD has integrated many types of therapy, such as acupuncture, chiropractic, and yoga, and anything that has evidence to support its efficacy is being utilized. However, Curry points out that the real challenge lies in the large-scale need of the veteran population, and many slipped through the cracks. Curry identified that the problem was that the DoD outsourced to a third-party company that was paid low rates for a one-hour meeting with a veteran, leading to variations and opinions that were inaccurate.

01:40:00
In this section, Shannon Curry discusses the challenges that military personnel with PTSD face after returning from service. She notes that many of them feel emotionally numb, struggle to articulate some of their thoughts and thoughts and are reluctant to disclose certain aspects of their condition, including the feeling of not loving their children or spouses anymore, amongst others. According to Curry, those with PTSD believe that very few people understand their challenges, which makes life difficult after returning from service. Additionally, she mentions that Ukraine's war is brutal and showcases the human condition in its purest form. Finally, she speaks on the importance of love as a transcendent force in the universe and advises young people to pursue their passions, as that will make their lives fulfilling.

01:45:00
In this section, a sense of love and ease is discussed as the truth of life, which connects all of us, and holds us back from that truth when negative things are said about others. The harm caused by misinformation is highlighted, and Shannon Curry hopes that everything will be okay. The conversation ends on a note of encouragement as words from Charles Bukowski are shared, reminding listeners to keep going even when it feels tough.
