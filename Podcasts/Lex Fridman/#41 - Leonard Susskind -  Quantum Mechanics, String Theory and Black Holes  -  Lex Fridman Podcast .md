# Summary of Leonard Susskind: Quantum Mechanics, String Theory and Black Holes | Lex Fridman Podcast #41

In this video, Leonard Susskind discusses how he uses intuition to think about quantum mechanics, black holes, and string theory. He argues that most of modern physics is not intuitive, but that with time and familiarity, one can develop new intuitions. He also discusses the potential of quantum computers, and the philosophical implications of thinking of the universe as an information processing system.

Leonard Susskind discusses how intuition is a central part of his scientific thinking, and how he uses it to think about quantum mechanics, black holes, and string theory. He argues that most of modern physics is not intuitive, but that with time and familiarity, one can develop new intuitions.

00:05:00
Leonard Susskind discusses the different ways that he doubts his ability to do something, and how this insecurity led him to join the scientific community. He also discusses how different kinds of thinking (feeling vs. thinking) are important in scientific discovery.

Quantum Mechanics, String Theory, and Black Holes:

Leonard Susskind discusses his experiences as an outsider in academic physics, the sudden transition into insider status, and the importance of brainstorming with others. He also discusses the potential of quantum computers, which are based on quantum mechanical ideas.

00:15:00
Leonard Susskind discusses the power of quantum computers and their potential application in understanding complex systems, such as the brain. He also discusses the relationship between quantum computers and black holes, which are known for their strange and mysterious behavior.

00:20:00
The speaker discusses the philosophical implications of thinking of the universe as an information processing system. He argues that, when done correctly, introspection can lead to incorrect conclusions about how the brain functions. He goes on to discuss the potential benefits of computer scientists eventually being able to build machines that are intelligent enough to understand the complexities of the brain.

00:25:00
Leonard Susskind discusses the fundamental low-level behavior of systems, how it can be simplified, and the limitations of current machine learning approaches. He also discusses how physicists can bring value to machine learning, and how time scale predictions can become useless.

00:30:00
In this video, physicist Leonard Susskind discusses the dream of String Theory, its mathematical underpinnings, and its various applications so far. He emphasizes that String Theory is a tool, not a subject, and that it has been successful in verifying the consistency of gravity and quantum mechanics.

00:35:00
In this video, physicist Leonard Susskind discusses the concept of quantum mechanics and its relationship to the mind-body problem. He also discusses the idea of observer effects, which suggests that the observer can mold the observed system.

00:40:00
The video discusses how entropy can be used to reverse a system's direction of motion, and how this can be done with a small amount of effort in a laboratory. It is not time travel, but rather a reversal of the second law of thermodynamics.

00:45:00
Leonard Susskind discusses quantum mechanics, string theory, and black holes. He explains that while quantum mechanics can be simulated on a computer, the universe we live in is not the same as the anti-de sitter space. He also discusses the theory of eternal inflation, which suggests that the universe is expanding exponentially.

Both sides on one of the sides and none of the sides so what my real opinion is. Infinity on both sides oh boy yeah yeah. That's why is that your favorite because it's the the most just mind-blowing no. Because we want a beginning no why do we want a beginning? I practiced it was the beginning of course and practice it was a beginning but could it have been a random fluctuation in an otherwise infinite time maybe in any case the the eternal inflation theory I think if correctly understood it would be infinite in both directions how do you think about infinity? Oh God so okay of course you can think about mathematically I just finished this discussion with my friend Sergey Brin yes how do you think about infinity? I say well Sergey Brin is infinitely rich how do you test that hypothesis? Okay essential good lines all right yeah so there's no there's really no way to visualize some of these things like ya know this is a very good question those physics have any is does infinity have any place in physics right? Right and well I can say is very good question. So what do you think of the recent first image of a black hole visualized from the event horizon telescope? It's an incredible triumph of science in itself the fact that

00:55:00
According to Leonard Susskind, computers have been able to "evolve" intelligence without any instruction from humans. This raises the question of whether intelligence is something that can be "evolved" or if it is something that is pre-determined.
