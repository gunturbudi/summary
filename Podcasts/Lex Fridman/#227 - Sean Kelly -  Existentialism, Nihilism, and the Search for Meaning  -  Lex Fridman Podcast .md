Sean Kelly discusses existentialism and the idea that there is no inherent meaning in life. He says that this is something that is expressed in different ways by various existentialists, but that the core idea is that there is no ground for making decisions other than the fact that you are a conscious, thinking being. This can be terrifying because there is no one responsible for your actions, and you constantly have to make choices without knowing what the right answer is.

Sean Kelly discusses existentialism, nihilism, and the search for meaning in relation to his experience playing with Miles Davis.
