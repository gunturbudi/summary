Proteins are the basic building blocks of life, but their modular complexity means they can carry out a variety of functions. Dmitry Korkin discusses this concept with Lex Fridman.

00:05:00
The video discusses how scientists have been able to structurally resolve proteins over the years, with x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy being the two main techniques. Cry electron microscopy has recently allowed for the examination of larger molecules and molecular complexes, which has led to the first experimental structure of a sarscove to protein being solved in 2018. The video goes on to discuss how complex proteins are made up of multiple proteins, and how some proteins have similar subunits that may have evolved from a homo oligomer.

Dmitry Korkin discusses the evolution of proteins, viruses, life, and artificial intelligence. He discusses the possibility of designing new treatments, such as nanoparticles that resemble viral spikes and compete with real viruses, and the importance of understanding the structure of the viral envelope. He also mentions the potential for targeting the m dimer of the protein, which would destroy the viral particle, preventing it from functioning.

00:20:00
Dmitry Korkin discusses the evolution of proteins, viruses, life, and artificial intelligence. He says that although there is more attack surface for viruses, proteins are more stable and evolutionarily more advanced. He discusses recent jumps in virus populations and the potential for mutations to become more dangerous and selectively mute the virus for evolution. He says that although he is not overly worried about the virus, it is important to study it in order to understand its evolution and potential mechanisms for jump.

00:25:00
In this video, Dmitry Korkin describes the evolution of proteins, viruses, life, and artificial intelligence.

00:30:00
Dmitry Korkin discusses the protein domain level, alternative splicing, and termini in relation to the evolution of proteins, viruses, life, and artificial intelligence.

00:35:00
In this interview, Dmitry Korkin discusses the evolution of proteins, viruses, life, and artificial intelligence. He notes that proteins can undergo random mutations, and that the interactions among proteins and genes create a complex layer of complexity. He also mentions the Code Golf challenge, in which programmers must create the shortest program possible in a given language.

00:40:00
Dmitry Korkin discusses the evolution of proteins, viruses, life, and AI. He believes that the machine learning systems of today are similar to biological systems, in that they can be turned off. He also thinks about a world where we jump from biological systems to artificial ones, in which we take the area of intelligent agents (codes that run and interact and exchange information) and apply it to robots. Korkin believes that the ideas are there, and that we should explore them further.

00:45:00
Dmitry Korkin discusses the Drake equation and the probability of life developing on habitable planets. He notes that while one percent is a low probability, it is still a good chance. He also points out that Earth is lucky to have the conditions it does, and that there are many factors that contribute to this luck.

00:50:00
Dmitry Korkin discusses the evolution of proteins, viruses, life, and artificial intelligence. He says that while life is common, it's still quite rare to find evidence of it on other planets.

00:55:00
Dmitry Korkin discusses his research in the area of molecular chemistry and computer aided drug design. He shares a story about how he met and spoke with Nobel Prize-winning chemist, Joshua Lederberg.

01:00:00
This video discusses the history of protein evolution and how Dmitry Korkin's "leatherberg" project helped to pave the way for modern bioinformatics. Korkin's ideas led to the development of "expert systems" that could automatically identify extraterrestrial molecules. Although these systems initially proved successful, they eventually evolved into modern machine learning techniques.

01:05:00
The AlphaFold competition, which is the gold standard for predicting protein folding, has been solved by two deep minds in 2020. Alpha Fold is an incredible accomplishment that is relevant to our understanding of protein folding.

01:10:00
Dmitry Korkin discusses the evolution of proteins, viruses, life, and artificial intelligence. His paper "Alpha Fault: A New Paradigm for Protein Structure Prediction" is not yet released, but he discusses some of the ideas that are already out there. Alpha Fault is a new machine learning method that outperforms traditional methods, and it seems to incorporate other structures into its predictions.

01:15:00
This video discusses the evolution of proteins, viruses, life, and artificial intelligence. Dmitry Korkin describes how structural similarities among proteins can be used to infer their evolutionary history. The paper describing this research was published in a blog post, not a scientific journal.

01:20:00
Dmitry Korkin discusses the evolution of proteins, viruses, life, and artificial intelligence. He says that in order to understand how proteins fold, we need to understand the structures of their individual domains. He also mentions that achieving human-level performance on computer vision was a major milestone in artificial intelligence development. Finally, he says that one of the greatest accomplishments in engineering is the development of autonomous vehicles.

He discusses a project called Deep Rembrandt, in which an artificial intelligence group trained an algorithm to replicate the style of Rembrandt.

01:30:00
Dmitry Korkin discusses the evolution of proteins, viruses, life, and artificial intelligence. He states that while open AI has the potential to be powerful, it is not yet compelling to many people. He mentions one of his favorite proteins and explains that it is composed of multiple proteins that never form a stable structure.

01:35:00
Dmitry Korkin discusses the role of proteins in the development of life and in the development of artificial intelligence. He states that proteins are flexible and can be used to scaffold other proteins, and that alpha fold two may be a large percentage of a Nobel Prize. He believes that the computational methods used to study proteins will eventually be recognized as Nobel Prize-worthy.

01:40:00
Dmitry Korkin discusses the principle of computational physics, which states that all three of the fundamental forces of nature are computational. He also discusses how this applies to proteins, viruses, and life, and how machine learning could be used to engineer viruses.

01:45:00
In this YouTube video, Dmitry Korkin discusses the evolution of proteins, viruses, life, and artificial intelligence. He says that if we can transfer the information that machines learn about proper protein sequences, it would be extremely useful in vaccine development and anti-viral drug development. He also says that the hope is that, eventually, machine learning can be used to design greater weapons of destruction. However, he is more worried about natural pandemics because they can do a better job than humans at producing viruses.

01:50:00
Dmitry Korkin discusses how his philosophical, psychological, and biological worldview has changed since he first started studying computational biology, and how the level of data available has led to unprecedented advances in the field. He also mentions the competition Context Racing, in which competitors try to predict the number of infections in different regions.
