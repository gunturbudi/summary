David Ferrucci is the founder and CEO of Elemental Cognition, a company working to engineer AI systems that understand the world the way people do. In his conversation with Alex Friedman, he discusses the difference between biological and computer systems, the philosophical presupposition that if we can get machines to think, they will be able to understand, and the goal of recreating human intelligence. He argues that even in this process, human intelligence is something to be amiable and introspective about.

00:05:00
David Ferrucci discusses the importance of intelligence, explaining that it is the ability to predict outcomes accurately and consistently in a highly dynamic and uncertain environment. He also discusses the similarities between intelligence and machine learning, noting that if a machine can do what a human can do with less data and less training, it is considered to be intelligent.

00:10:00
David Ferrucci discusses the differences between intelligence and prediction, and how humans use storytelling to prove their intelligence to others.

00:30:00
David Ferrucci discusses how his experience with IBM Watson, Jeopardy, and deep conversations with artificial intelligence informs his perspective on how a computer could interpret and reason about social and political events. He believes that shared knowledge can be encoded in a computer's hardware, but that humans will often interpret events differently based on their own frames of reference.

00:35:00
David Ferrucci discusses the importance of frameworks in AI, and how Watson's victory on Jeopardy demonstrated the importance of learning and understanding common frameworks. He is unconvinced about time travel yet believes it to be a solvable problem.

00:40:00
David Ferrucci discusses IBM's Watson software, which has been used to win several rounds of Jeopardy, and how machine learning can be used to create intelligent architectures that can communicate with humans. He believes that the relationship between the human and machine needs to be explained in detail, and that machines will eventually be able to do things better than humans.

00:45:00
In this video, IBM Watson Jeopardy winner David Ferrucci discusses how the human and machine are working together to monitor and correct system failures. Ferrucci believes that the collaboration between human and machine will be a permanent example of technology. He also explains how reasoning by analogy can help us understand how different groups of people will interpret the same statement.

00:50:00
David Ferrucci discusses IBM's Watson artificial intelligence system, its ability to reason, and its impact on public discourse. He also discusses the game of Jeopardy and its history, noting that the questions have become more complex and subtle over time. He notes that humans must be able to make connections and determine the questions asked in order to be successful on the show.

00:55:00
In 2004, IBM researchers were looking into the feasibility of a computer playing Jeopardy. They were unsuccessful in convincing their superiors to fund the project, but one employee, David Ferrucci, was passionate about the idea and decided to pursue it on his own. Watson, an AI created by Ferrucci, took on Jeopardy in 2005 and 2006, but was unsuccessful. Ferrucci discusses the project and how Watson came to be.

01:00:00
Senior research leader at IBM Research discusses the challenges and potential of using IBM Watson to answer open domain questions. He argues that the technology is possible, and that if IBM Research can overcome some of the challenges, it has the potential to be a "grand challenge" in artificial intelligence.

01:05:00
David Ferrucci discusses IBM's Watson artificial intelligence project and how it is improving upon earlier machine learning technologies. He also discusses the difficulties of searching for information on the internet and how IBM's Watson platform overcame this limitation. Finally, Ferrucci discusses the need to have a deep understanding of the problem before attempting to solve it, and how this understanding is key to innovation.

01:40:00
David Ferrucci discusses how machines will be better predictors than humans in the future, and how they will struggle to communicate with humans in a deeper way. He believes that the Turing test is a good measure of intelligence, and that humans are good at justifying or explaining what they've heard.

David Ferrucci, a computer scientist, discusses the challenges of AI and how it will be reflected in everyday life. He also discusses Alpha Zero, an AI system that recently competed against the world's top Go players.

01:50:00
David Ferrucci discusses the optimization problem, which is to create a system that is able to explain away lawyers away. He thinks that this is where technology and social discourse are going to get deeply intertwined, and that in other cases it becomes more obvious where you know it's I got like why did you decide to give that person you know a longer sentence or or to deny them parole again policy decisions. He thinks that AI has a role to play in helping to make these decisions more effectively.

01:55:00
