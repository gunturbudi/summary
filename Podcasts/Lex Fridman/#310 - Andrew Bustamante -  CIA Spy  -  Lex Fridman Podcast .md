Andrew Bustamante is a former CIA covert intelligence officer and U.S. air force combat veteran. He discusses the job of operational targeting encrypted communications and launch operations for 200 nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles.

The president has a very narrow focus, which may be a problem because it limits the amount of time they are able to devote to the best interests of the United States.
