He goes on to say that there is a fundamental problem to be solved in order to achieve general artificial intelligence, and that much progress has been made in the last few years with regards to learning to learn.

00:20:00
Oriol Vinyals discusses deep learning and artificial general intelligence and how they are expanding to other modalities, including vision and actions. He also discusses the development of gato, which was named after a sequence of releases that used animal names to name some of their models.

00:25:00
Oriol Vinyals, a deep learning specialist, discusses the origins of deep learning and how it is similar to artificial general intelligence. He also explains how deep learning is trained, with the help of imitation learning.

00:30:00
In this video, Oriol Vinyals, a researcher at Deepmind, discusses his work on deep learning and artificial general intelligence. He explains that, in order to train a deep learning model to do tasks such as playing Atari games or recognizing written language, they use a data set that contains a variety of experiences, including those from internet searches and asian video games. He also mentions that, although the model is relatively small, it is still able to perform well on a challenging data set.

00:35:00
In this video, Oriol Vinyals discusses how deep learning and artificial general intelligence work and how they are able to understand text and images. He also explains that tokenization is a process of breaking down text or images into smaller pieces that are easier to work with.

Oriol Vinyals discusses how deep learning and artificial general intelligence are modular and how the modularity is achieved in flamingo. He also talks about how deep learning has progressed since flamingo was released and how there is still much to be explored.

00:55:00
Oriol Vinyals discusses the benefits of modularity in neural networks and how it can be applied to artificial general intelligence development. He also discusses meta-learning, which refers to the ability of a machine learning system to learn on its own and improve its performance over time.

01:00:00
Oriol Vinyals discusses the concepts of "deep learning" and "artificial general intelligence" and how they are evolving. He predicts that in five years, we will be able to teach artificial general intelligence to play complex games, such as Starcraft.

01:05:00
Oriol Vinyals discusses how deep learning and artificial general intelligence can be achieved by using a technique called "nearest neighbor." This algorithm is simple and does not require learning, which makes it a good choice for tasks that do not require a lot of complexity. He also discusses how the interactive version of nearest neighbor could be used to help humans pull out the classifier from a giant data set.
