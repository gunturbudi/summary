This podcast interviews Richard Wolff, a leading Marxist economist and philosopher. Wolff discusses Marx's theory of capitalism and how it has been interpreted throughout the world. He also discusses the Paris Commune, an event in which Marx's ideas were put into practice.

00:05:00
In this video, Richard Wolff discusses Marxism and Communism, explaining that while the two theories have different qualities, they both arose as critiques of capitalism. He also points out that, over time, Marxism has evolved into a theory of how to organize society, with different parts differing on what the alternative society should look like. This tradition has continued through different countries and periods of history, with some parts of it remaining focused on critique of capitalism, and others expanding on the idea of an alternative post-capitalist society.

00:10:00
In this video, Richard Wolff discusses Marxism and communism. He points out that the basic idea of Marxism is that human society can do better than capitalism, and that it should try to do so. Wolff also discusses the critiques of capitalism that have been made over the years, and how the Russian Revolution paved the way for more widespread understanding of Marxism. He argues that even though the United States has a strong taboo against Marxism, it is still alive and well in some ways, and that American audiences are often unaware of this.

00:15:00
In the early days of Marx's writing, he focused on critiquing capitalism. However, later in his life, he and other producers of an anti-capitalist movement shifted their focus to another question: how to do better than capitalism.

00:20:00
In this video, Richard Wolff discusses Marxism and Communism and the idea of seizing the government to get rid of capitalism. There is a big debate among Marxists about how to do this, with some advocating for revolution while others believe reformism is the way to go. The focus on the state goes beyond what the debaters at the time thought, and has since been greatly influenced by the Russian Revolution.

00:25:00
In this video, Richard Wolff discusses the debate between reformists and revolutionaries in regards to the mechanism of progress. Wolff argues that, in most cases, the reformists have always won this debate because revolution is dangerous and scary.

00:30:00
Richard Wolff discusses Marxism and communism, explaining that while Marxism is concerned with the class struggle and respecting the working class, central planning is not a part of Marxism. He goes on to say that, while some attempts to go beyond capitalism were unsuccessful, Marxists understand what they're trying to do better than those who attempted to go beyond capitalism in the past.

00:35:00
Richard Wolff discusses how Karl Marx's theory of exploitation explains how a majority of people in a society produce more than they consume, and how this creates a surplus which is often taken advantage of by those in power. He also points out that, because the translation of the German word "m-e-h-r" into "surplus" was incorrect, this theory has often been misinterpreted.

00:40:00
The video discusses the difference between communism and exploitation, and explains that communism is not just about who the exploiter is, but the exploitation itself. If we want to achieve communism, we need to change the way the workplace is organized.

00:45:00

00:50:00
The video discusses the risks associated with different types of work, with a focus on the risks taken by workers in capitalist societies and the capitalists who own and operate these businesses. The worker in the capitalist society who moved his family to take a job in a different part of the country, took on a lot of risk in order to provide for his family. The worker in the capitalist society who makes a lower salary than a car park attendant because he is a man, also takes on risk.

Richard Wolff discusses the origins of economics, which he believes to be rooted in capitalism.

01:15:00
Richard Wolff discusses the idea of democracy in the workplace and the contradiction between how democracy is practiced in this society and how it is supposed to be practiced.
