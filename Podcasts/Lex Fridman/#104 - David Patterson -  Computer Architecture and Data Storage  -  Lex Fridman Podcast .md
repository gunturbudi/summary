Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
David Patterson is a computer scientist who is known for his work in RISC processor architecture and RAID storage. He also co-authored a book with John Hennessy on the inner workings of computers. This conversation covers Patterson's history working on computers and the microprocessor, as well as the current state of cryptocurrency development.

00:05:00
David Patterson, a computer architect and data storage pioneer, discusses the history of microprocessors and Moore's law. He also recalls how unexpected events in his personal life furthered his understanding of how technology affects society.

00:10:00
Computer science fundamentals introduces the concept of abstraction, which suggests that we suspend disbelief and pretend that the only thing we know is the layer of abstraction we're studying. This way, we can make complicated things. In the past 10 years, open source hardware has made it possible for anyone to see inside the hardware, which is a remarkable development.

00:15:00
David Patterson discusses the benefits of reducing an instruction set to a few simple ones in order to speed up computer execution. This idea was controversial at the time, and was fiercely debated at several conferences. In the end, the benefits proved to outweigh the risks.

00:20:00
David Patterson discusses how computer architecture and data storage have evolved over time, and how risk was developed as a way to improve efficiency. He cites Berkeley and Stanford as places where radicals advocated for this approach, and notes that it was easy to make the argument against risk. He continues by saying that, despite this, he still believes in the power of their ideas.

00:25:00
David Patterson discusses the challenges of designing an efficient instruction set for a computer, and how Intel's RISC architecture helped make it easier for programmers and compilers alike.

00:30:00
David Patterson and Lex Fridman discuss computer architecture, focusing on how metrics are used to compare different architectures. The pair discuss how the clock cycle time and number of instructions per clock cycle can be used to compare different architectures.

00:35:00
David Patterson discusses the history of the RISC instruction set, how it has evolved over the years, and how it has advantages over more complex instruction sets. He also shares his predictions for 2020, which are surprisingly accurate.

00:40:00
David Patterson discusses Risk 5, an open instruction set architecture that allows for open source implementations, and its potential benefits. He notes that while universities are good at starting things, they struggle to keep them up.

00:45:00
Arm dominates the mobile device market and the instruction set is more efficient than other options. Arm's popularity may be related to its power efficiency and ability to adapt to changing markets.

00:50:00
David Patterson explains how the risk instruction set architecture (RISA) is more energy-efficient and in accordance with today's computer world, both in the cloud and on cell phones. Apple has a strong design team behind their microprocessors, as ARM is a common instruction set used by many other companies.

00:55:00
David Patterson discusses the history of computer architecture, noting that instruction sets have not changed much in decades, and how this has changed in recent years as Moore's Law has slowed down. He goes on to say that the underlying computational medium for all sorts of artificial intelligence systems may be fairly simple.

01:00:00
In this video, David Patterson discusses the slowdown in processor speed and how innovative machine learning methods are helping to compensate. He also notes that general-purpose computers will likely not get any faster in the future, and that computer designers will have to come up with new ways to accelerate performance.

01:05:00
In this video, computer architect David Patterson discusses the challenges and opportunities for software in the next decade. He describes how hardware and software are working together to accelerate machine learning.

01:10:00
In this video, David Patterson discusses the importance of benchmarks in the field of computer architecture and data storage. He explains that while benchmarks can be helpful in establishing a level playing field, they can also be misleading if not conducted correctly. He also says that there is a lack of openness in the field of machine learning, which is hindering its development.

01:15:00
David Patterson discusses how he uses benchmarks to figure out how well different algorithms work, and how this helps to guide his intuition when designing computer systems. He also comments on quantum computing, saying that while it is not right around the corner, it is still a decade away from being error corrected.

01:20:00
This YouTube video discusses the idea that Moore's law may no longer be in effect, and Gordon Moore has since spoken out against this idea. Patterson points to evidence that Moore's law is still in effect, but Intel reinterpreted it because they believed it was no longer true.

01:25:00
David Patterson discusses the impact of Moore's Law slowing down and how this will affect the future of computing. He discusses RAID and how it helped introduce the idea of redundant arrays of inexpensive disks, which had a revolutionary effect.

01:30:00
David Patterson, a computer architect at Berkeley, describes the development of RAID, a storage technology that is more reliable than traditional hard disks. RAID is still used today, and Patterson predicts that it will remain popular for the next several decades.

01:35:00
David Patterson discusses the importance of teaching and research not conflicting with each other, and how it helps to improve his research. He also talks about the critic Richard Fineman, who said that the Institute of Advanced Studies was a mistake because it was supposed to be a heaven without any teaching. Patterson thinks that the interaction between a teaching university and students with bright minds is important for research to progress.

01:40:00
David Patterson discusses the importance of teamwork and how it has helped him in his research and career. He also discusses his experience wrestling at UCLA and El Camino College, and how it has helped him develop physical self-confidence and a successful team-building skills.

01:45:00
David Patterson discusses how to make the most of one's career by focusing on what is important and not getting bogged down by unnecessary details. He recommends simplifying one's life and focusing on what is truly important.
