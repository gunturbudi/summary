Ayanna Howard discusses the important role trust plays in human-robot interaction, and how this trust can be built and maintained. She also discusses the ethical implications of human-robot interaction, noting that robots may someday have rights similar to humans.

Detail Summary:

Ayanna Howard discusses the concept of perfectionism in robotics, and how it differs from the idea of achieving optimal behavior. She discusses how this concept is important when designing robots, and how they must be able to interact with humans flawlessly in order to be considered 'perfect'.

00:05:00
Ayanna Howard discusses the human-robot interaction problem, which is that there is a gap between the perfect, "unquote" perfect interactions between humans and robots and the imperfect, but successful, interactions between humans and robots operating in real world settings. She discusses a Tesla car that is able to navigate a parking lot without a driver.

00:10:00
Ayanna Howard discusses the challenges of human-robot interaction, explaining that although humans initially fear and distrust robots, eventually they come to rely on them. She predicts that within the next year, humans will reach a point where they are completely trusting of robots, and that this will have a positive impact on society.

00:15:00
Ayanna Howard discusses the human-robot interaction and ethics of safety-critical systems. She points out that there are two types of humans - the early adopters who are comfortable with technology and the hyper-sensitive who are the ones who design the technology. She says that the target demographic for autonomous cars is the hyper-sensitive, but that there are ways to minimize noise. She says that the self-selection bias will lead to a population of acceptant people.

00:20:00
Ayanna Howard discusses the ethics of safety-critical systems, and how developers need to be aware of the potential ethical implications of their work. She also discusses the importance of bias in computer science, and how it can be overcome.

00:25:00
Ayanna Howard discusses the ethical implications of safety-critical systems, highlighting biases that may affect the function of such systems. She provides an example of a bias against teenage drivers, and points out that there may be gray areas in terms of whether an age bias is fair.

00:30:00
Ayanna Howard discusses the ethical implications of human-robot interactions, focusing on the issue of bias in predictive policing and healthcare algorithms. She notes that while society has biases, hopefully we learn from them and strive to be more ethical.

00:35:00
Ayanna Howard discusses the ethical implications of safety-critical systems that are manned by humans and robots working side-by-side. She argues that, even though AI is still inferior to humans in some respects, it is better than nothing and should be used more to improve decision-making processes.

00:40:00
Ayanna Howard discusses the human-robot interaction and ethics of safety-critical systems. She notes that while most people don't realize that leaders have a whole lot of advice, they can still have a big impact on the ethicality of algorithms. One way that leaders can help improve the ethicality of algorithms is by encouraging companies to award bug bounties for finding ethics holes.

00:45:00
Ayanna Howard discusses the ethics of safety-critical systems, highlighting the importance of humans being involved in the equation at some point. She discusses some fascinating moments in robotic space exploration that NASA was involved in, including the use of a failsafe algorithm in Space Odyssey and the use of a human as a fallback in the event that assumptions were wrong.

00:50:00
Ayanna Howard discusses her memories of working at NASA on a surgical robot system that could do eye surgery, and her motivation for wanting to be a roboticist. She also mentions that she is drawn to humanoid robots, and that meeting one in person would be a magical experience. Howard believes that the future of robots in space is positive, and that they will continue to play a role in human civilization's exploration of space.

00:55:00
Ayanna Howard discusses the challenges of human-robot interaction, noting that emotions can lead to irrational decision-making. She says that psychologists and roboticists can help to solve these problems by understanding human-human relationships and developmental milestones.

01:00:00
Ayanna Howard discusses the role of trust in human-robot interactions, noting that trust is not simply a measure of whether someone trusts a machine, but also of their behavior in light of that trust. She discusses the importance of understanding behavior in order to build trust, and notes that trust is a delicate issue, as it can be easily broken.

01:05:00
Ayanna Howard discusses the role trust plays in human-robot interactions, and how it's important to educate users correctly in the first encounter. She also discusses the exciting applications of human-robot interaction, such as in the field of healthcare.

01:10:00
Ayanna Howard discusses the importance of human-robot interaction and the challenges faced when trying to educate large groups of people. She also discusses the potential for workforce development through training in coding and other skills.

01:15:00
Ayanna Howard discusses the ethical implications of human-robot interaction, focusing on the idea of love being a form of mutual manipulation. She believes that AI agents could eventually be able to emulate love back, meaning that if the AI is programmed to care about the well-being of the person it is linked to, the two will be able to have a healthy relationship. However, she also notes that this does not mean that all human-robot interactions will be positive, as there may be cases where the AI agent puts the other person's needs before their own.

01:20:00
Ayanna Howard discusses the human-robot interaction field and how the development of ethically-sound safety-critical systems will necessitate an understanding of the ethical implications of such systems. She suggests that robots may have rights similar to those of humans in terms of being protected from abuse, but that they may also have rights to property or animal status. If ethically-sound safety-critical systems are to be developed, this conversation will need to take place soon.

01:25:00
Ayanna Howard discusses the difficulty of running a robotics company, and how the success of some companies, like Google, Facebook, and iRobot, can be attributed to their success in finding a product market fit. She also talks about the possibility of the robotics industry moving into a new era, where more companies can become successful.

01:30:00
Ayanna Howard discusses the ethics of safety-critical systems, noting that although people should be afraid of robots at first, the positive impact of robotics will outweigh any potential negative impacts.

01:35:00
Ayanna Howard discusses the human-robot interaction and ethics of safety-critical systems. She believes that despite the advantages of robots over humans, a strong relationship still exists between the two, and that the key to solving ethical issues is communication between experts in the field.
