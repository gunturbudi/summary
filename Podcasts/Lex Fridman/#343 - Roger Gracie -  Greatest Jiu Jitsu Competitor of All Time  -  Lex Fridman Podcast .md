Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
In this section, Roger Gracie discusses his walk to the mat and his process of clearing his mind of all thoughts before a match. He talks about the importance of focus and concentration and how it's difficult to achieve the state of blankness. Additionally, he points out that as a black belt competitor, he has learned to let go of all thoughts, and not think about what can go wrong or right, as it only causes nervousness. Roger also explains how he tries to calculate every move he makes to save as much energy as possible and be fully focused on the fight with no distractions, especially energy-wise.

00:05:00
In this section, Roger Gracie discusses the importance of instincts in fighting and the beauty of timing the right moment to make a move. He emphasizes that it's not about how quickly you move, but about the move itself at that precise moment. Although Judo requires more explosiveness and faster movements, the timing of the move remains crucial. Gracie also mentions that there is not much data to build up confidence when facing a new opponent, such as his match against Buchecha, but his belief in himself and his achievements give him the confidence to win.

00:10:00
In this section, Gracie discusses his training leading up to his second fight with Buchecha and how it differed from his first fight. He mentions that he had focused more on MMA for a couple of months and had neglected training in the gi, causing his responses during training to be off. However, he was more confident during the second fight because he trusted his defense and didn't think he would get tapped out quickly. He also talks about the importance of tapping out during training and not sacrificing your body, as it can lead to permanent damage.

00:15:00
In this section, Roger Gracie discusses the importance of practicing defense in jiu-jitsu and how it can affect competition. He expresses regret for not having a strong defense earlier in his career, which led him to be less risk-taking in competition due to fear. However, he also acknowledges the importance of being good in every position and practicing both escaping bad positions and transitioning into them. Gracie attributes his confidence in never having been submitted to his extensive training in both offense and defense in all positions, which makes him a complete martial artist. He admits that even with practice, some positions such as bottom side control are still extremely difficult and hard to escape.

00:20:00
In this section, Lex Fridman and Roger Gracie discuss how difficult it is to escape side control, the importance of defense over escape, and the ego and nerves that come with being a high-level competitor. Gracie explains that side control is a nightmare to escape, especially if the person on top is a great pinner who prioritizes control over progression. To master the technique, Gracie recommends practicing escapes repeatedly for at least five minutes at a time, focusing first on defense and then on escape. Additionally, Gracie reflects on how confident he is as a competitor and how he felt going into his match against Bruno Malfacine in Rio, knowing that everything he had achieved was on the line.

00:25:00
In this section, Roger Gracie discusses his strategy going into a fight against a larger and stronger opponent. He mentions that he would always prefer being on top instead of at the bottom because it allows him to dictate the pace of the fight. During this fight, he decided to play defense for the first five minutes before gradually picking up the pace because the opponent was larger and stronger. He also talks about how he could feel his opponent's mounting frustration during the fight.

00:30:00
In this section, Roger Gracie provides a play-by-play commentary of a jiu-jitsu match and explains his thought process during the bout. He describes how he sensed his opponent's mental state and used that to his advantage by anticipating the moves he would make. Gracie also talks about how he defended against an attack on his foot by holding his opponent's arm, preventing him from coming up to attack. Finally, he discusses his strategy for taking the back and how he exploited his opponent's mistake to gain the upper hand.

00:35:00
In this section, Roger Gracie discusses his strategy against Buchecha in their 2017 match. Gracie notes that Buchecha relied too much on his size and strength to get out of situations, rather than having a strong defense. Gracie also describes how he was able to control the fight and get Buchecha on his back, leading to a progression of mistakes that eventually resulted in Gracie winning by submission. Gracie and the host also discuss the mechanics and effectiveness of the lapel choke, with Gracie explaining that while going under the chin is more effective, it is not necessary to choke someone out.

00:40:00
In this section, Roger Gracie discusses the details of performing a chokehold. He explains that he only goes for the kill when he gets the neck, and he digs in with one hand before adjusting the collar with the other. Gracie clarifies that using both hands provides better control of the choke and the turning of the opponent. Later, he shares his strategy for attacking in close guard and how he developed it. Gracie also talks about what he learned from his cousin, Hanzo Gracie, including the importance of taking any challenge and having confidence in oneself.

00:45:00
In this section, Roger Gracie speaks about his war spirit and the challenges he has faced throughout his career. He believes that people are measured not when they are at their strongest, but when they are at their weakest. Gracie admits that he has never given up during any fight and remarks that he is most proud of the fact that he has never doubted himself. He expresses regret over one of his blue belt matches when he quit after feeling exhausted, but realized that quitting is not an option because it teaches people that it's okay to quit in other aspects of life. Gracie emphasizes the importance of shutting down the voice that says, "just stop" and never allowing oneself to quit, which he believes is a powerful tool for success.

00:50:00
In this section, Roger Gracie discusses his mindset during fights and how quitting has never been an option for him. He attributes this to his strong desire to reach his destination and accomplish his goals. Gracie also talks about a particular interview happening before one of his fights in Rio, where he joked about tapping out his opponent. He could sense that his opponent was uncomfortable, and this gave him a bit of confidence. Gracie's calmness both in Jiu Jitsu and life is a reflection of his personality. He has always been calm and has learned to shut off his mind to avoid the rush of adrenaline that comes with stress. This mindset has helped him deal with stress in regular life situations such as important meetings. Even though Gracie admits to getting angry, it is a fleeting emotion, and he has never lost control of his emotions.

00:55:00
In this section, Roger Gracie talks about his emotional state and how his success as an athlete affected it. He admits that he has become emotionally closed off from the world, making it harder for him to be vulnerable to others. However, he also notes that he has started crying more often in recent years. Gracie also shares some stories about his pre-competition routine, which included watching movies like Braveheart and Gladiator to get into the warrior spirit. He talks about his self-belief and how he always knew he had the potential to be the best in the world, which he attributes to a decision he made early on in his career.

01:00:00
In this section, Roger Gracie discusses his introduction to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. He shares that he didn't train much as a child, only occasionally practicing Judo until the age of 10 to 14. It wasn't until he went to stay with his uncle in Brazil when he was 14 that he experienced what it meant to be a part of a Jiu-Jitsu training lifestyle. He was fascinated by it, motivating him to train every day, even after returning home to Rio. Despite nobody believing in him, he continued his training, never losing focus on his mission to become the best in the world. Roger's self-belief and determination never wavered, as he didn't need approval from anyone, even those who were older, wiser, or better than him.

01:05:00
In this section, Gracie talks about how he kept his dream of being the best Jiu-Jitsu competitor ever alive by consistently telling people that he would be. However, he mentions that saying it too many times leads to bragging and is not helpful in achieving one's goals. Gracie believes that sacrifices, hard work, and focus are crucial in achieving an individual's dreams. He also mentions that there is no single way to develop a game plan and emphasizes the importance of practicing frequently to perfect a technique. Gracie also talks about how people fail to see that the basics of Jiu-Jitsu are incredibly complex, which is why one needs to practice it consistently to perfect it.

01:10:00
In this section, Roger Gracie, the legend of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, talks about how the mastery of a move, such as the cross-collar choke from the mount position, takes years to achieve as it involves the control of the opponent's movement throughout the progression of moves. Roger emphasizes that it's not just about the move itself but rather how to control the movement of the opponent while they resist you and block your moves. The complexity of the position lies in the various ways the opponent can block, making it hard to use even when executed perfectly. Roger believes that what separates beginner white belts from legendary fighters, such as himself, is their ability to perceive and apply every detail of the process.

01:15:00
In this section, Roger Gracie discusses the importance of positioning in Jiu Jitsu, specifically when it comes to mounting an opponent. He explains that a dominant position like Mount requires a strong body position that doesn't rely on the hands for support, since the hands may be needed to stop the opponent's escape attempts. Mount is the most dominant position one can get over another person, as even untrained individuals can appreciate its dominance. However, Roger points out that taking the arms off and balancing can make it easier for the opponent to escape, making it crucial to have strong fundamentals before attempting to mount.

01:20:00
In this section, Roger Gracie discusses the pros and cons of being in different positions in Jiu-Jitsu, particularly inside control and mount. He argues that mount is the most exposed position and that inside control may be more difficult to learn, but it allows for greater control of the opponent’s movements. Gracie discusses the challenge of attacking the neck from mount and the vulnerability of placing a hand in the opponent’s collar, emphasizing the importance of body positioning and weight distribution. He notes that learning to apply pressure and weight from mount is a difficult skill to master but can be used to make opponents suffer without necessarily attacking.

01:25:00
In this section, Roger Gracie explains the challenge of defending oneself in Jiu Jitsu with only one hand while the other is occupied defending one side. He highlights the importance of getting the first hand deep and tight before attempting the second move, which is the hardest. Gracie also discusses how to reposition his weight to secure the second hand and how to stop his opponent from doing the same. He describes the slow process of transitioning from low to high mount and the two techniques he uses to get the second hand in: going behind the ear or going four fingers inside.

01:30:00
In this section, Roger Gracie explains his process towards mastery of Jiu-Jitsu and how it can be applied to other areas. He emphasizes the importance of practicing weakness instead of strength and training consistently until one gains confidence. Gracie believes that the best submission move in Jiu-Jitsu is choking, and that from a billion-dollar standpoint, one would be more likely to succeed in choking from the back rather than from mount position.

01:35:00
In this section, Roger Gracie discusses why he believes back control is a more dominant position than mount in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. He explains that the mount position offers very little space between the two opponents, making it difficult for the person on the bottom to work on their defense and escape. On the other hand, being in the back offers mobility and space to escape. He also debates the argument that having your hands available in the mount position makes it a more dominant position, saying that the space between the two fighters is still very limited. Gracie goes on to name Marcus "Buchecha" Almeida as the greatest Jiu-Jitsu competitor of all time due to his numerous titles and agility despite his heavyweight size.

01:40:00
In this section, Roger Gracie discusses his thoughts on Marcelo Garcia's technical abilities as a Jiu Jitsu Fighter. Although Marcelo may not be physically strong, Roger believes his raw technique in various positions for submissions is high-level. Roger shares that he has fought Marcelo twice in the past and was able to top him in the first fight by submitting him with a choke from the back and won by points in the second. The conversation touches on other Jiu Jitsu greats, such as Shonie and Saulo Ribeiro, and reflects on their performances in the ring.

01:45:00
In this section, Roger Gracie discusses his decision to walk away from jiu-jitsu after winning his second match against Marcus Almeida, also known as "Buchecha," arguably the greatest jiu-jitsu competitor of all time. Even though Gracie was still fighting MMA and competing in jiu-jitsu, it became very challenging to do both due to conflicts in training. Gracie insisted on continuing both at a high level, even though many others choose to focus on just one. Gracie's grips were an essential part of his game in jiu-jitsu, but they were significantly weakened due to training for MMA, especially when he tried to immediately compete in jiu-jitsu after completing an MMA fight. On the other hand, MMA fighters have to be quick and sharp from the moment the fight starts due to the constant risks involved in the sport.

01:50:00
In this section, Roger Gracie discusses the challenges that come with transitioning to MMA from Jiu-Jitsu. He explains how the physical demands of MMA, such as explosiveness and conditioning, require an athlete to respond much faster and move at a quicker pace. They also discussed how being on the bottom in the ground game changes every fundamental aspect, and the use of a closed guard is highly recommended as the opponent is in a disadvantageous position. Gracie also mentions that he wished he dedicated more time and effort to the physical part, like the strikes and the mental training, when he started.

01:55:00
In this section, Roger Gracie shares his thoughts about his transition to MMA, saying that he did not have the same passion for the sport as he did for Jiu Jitsu, but felt a duty to do it as a Gracie. He does not regret going into MMA, however, as it would have left him feeling something was missing if he had not pursued it. Gracie also talks about Gordon Ryan being the best no-gi competitor of his generation but cautions against calling him the best ever as he is still young and has yet to retire. He highlights how the nogi scene has grown and there are now more tournaments, allowing fighters to specialize in this discipline.

02:00:00
In this section, Roger Gracie discusses some of the new jiu-jitsu techniques that are being used in the sport, such as the body lock and foot locks. He notes that these techniques can be risky as they do not promote domination over one's opponent, which is the main goal in fighting. However, he acknowledges that the sport itself has changed over time, and these techniques are no longer seen as a bad thing to use in competition. He also mentions the importance of understanding the logistics and details of each move in order to be more knowledgeable and successful.

02:05:00
In this section, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu master Roger Gracie discusses the effectiveness of foot locks in a self-defense situation and how every position in a fight has a risk factor. He also talks about Gordon Ryan's impressive dedication, training, and mindset which includes working on one's weakness instead of just sparring tough. Gracie also credits John Donahue's cerebral approach to the game for Ryan's success and talks about the importance of understanding the ultimate dominance positions of back and mount for finishing.

02:10:00
In this section, Roger Gracie and Lex Fridman discuss John Danaher's ability to push his athletes to be their best. Gracie states that Danaher's dedication to his athletes makes him unique since, unlike other coaches, Danaher doesn't have other things in his life that take away from his time with the athletes. Fridman notes that Danaher is always researching and trying to improve the sport for his athletes, which sets him apart. The two also briefly discuss a recent back-and-forth about whether a bear could beat a lion in a fight.

02:15:00
In this section of the video, Lex Fridman asks Roger Gracie about his opinions on using a tie as a way to choke someone. Joe Rogan previously believed that a tie could be an effective way to attack somebody, but Gracie disagrees, saying it is a "shitty way" to choke someone due to its tendency to slide around. Despite George St. Pierre stating that the tie is useful for unbalancing an opponent, Gracie believes the jacket is a better option since there is something powerful about it, and it can be used to do a lot of damage. Additionally, Gracie mentions the importance of mobility and how it can affect one's ability to implement certain techniques, such as mounting or back control.

02:20:00
In this section, Roger Gracie discusses the preparation that he had for the World Championships when he moved to London and opened his school but had nobody to train with. He explains that he had to simulate realistic fighting environments and sharpen up all his skills as he had nobody to practice with that is of his level. He also emphasized how training with lower-level belts can help in improving attack and defense skills but that most high-level black belts do not have very good differences because they do not practice. Gracie also shared that he trained with Judo at the Budokai in London, which helped him significantly in learning something new and improving his Jujitsu base, top game, and pressure game.

02:25:00
In this section, Roger Gracie gives advice to beginners interested in starting Jiu Jitsu. He recommends that beginners focus on absorbing as much technique as possible and to be as relaxed as they can during practice. He notes that it is difficult for beginners to identify when they are tense or not relaxed and emphasizes the importance of moving slowly in order to improve grace and efficiency in movement. Gracie also gives advice to adult hobbyists, suggesting they aim to train two to three times per week initially, and to consistently practice the same techniques until they become proficient. He notes that while it is valuable to pick a set of techniques that you love, it is important to learn and practice all techniques as a comprehensive understanding is necessary for improvement.

02:30:00
In this section, the host and guest discuss the value of being a complete jiu-jitsu practitioner. Roger Gracie explains that to be the best in the world, you need to be complete and have no weaknesses that someone can capitalize on. However, for hobbyists, it is interesting to think about whether it's possible to focus on a small set of techniques and still become good at jiu-jitsu. Roger Gracie also notes that most people, including high-level competitors, have no clue how to use the close guard, and it's not essential for hobbyists to master it. Additionally, the discussion touches on the importance of relaxation and letting go of the ego when starting out and how it affects defending and growing as a person.

02:35:00
In this section, Gracie discusses the role of drilling in jiu-jitsu and explains why he does not like it. He explains that while drilling is important for learning the mechanics of a move, it is not realistic because the other person is not resisting. Once you learn the mechanics, there is no point in drilling anymore as you need to practice with resistance. While the benefits of drilling include getting more reps, he argues that it is pointless to carry on drilling after learning the mechanics as you need to know how to apply the movement against a fully resistant opponent. There is no way to truly learn the movement without applying it with full resistance, and the only way to achieve that is through practice.

02:40:00
In this section, jiu jitsu champion Roger Gracie talks about the importance of drilling and why it is especially crucial in wrestling and Judo due to the timing and precision of the movements involved. However, he explains that in jiu jitsu, although drilling is important for technique, it cannot replace training with a fully resistant opponent, which is the only way to develop the necessary feeling of timing and combinations for real-life situations. Gracie also talks about how he would fare against a bear, lion, tiger, gorilla, or anaconda, and explains why he would choose the anaconda and attempt to wait it out instead of fighting it head-on.

02:45:00
In this section, Roger Gracie discusses his confidence in his controlling positions in jiu-jitsu, even against animals like lions and gorillas. He also shares that he has never doubted himself, but has experienced low points in losses. The motivation that drives Gracie towards submissions over just winning is proving that he is the best, and he encourages young people to have determination, set goals, and surround themselves with successful people. Gracie attributes his self-belief as innate and natural, and stresses that surrounding oneself with winners is vital to success.

02:50:00
In this section, Roger Gracie and Lex Fridman discuss greatness and how anyone can achieve it, referencing examples such as Muhammad Ali and children who want to change the world. They also note the societal pressure for people to conform to a 'normal life' with a 'normal job,' acting as a deterrent for individuals to take risks and pursue their passions. However, with the rise of the internet and its potential for building communities of support, young people now have the ability to find those who believe in them and keep their flames of passion burning.

02:55:00
In this section, Roger Gracie talks about the importance of taking big risks and failing in order to become resilient and achieve success. He explains that most people have cowardice in them and are afraid to try because of the fear of failure and getting hurt. However, failure is necessary to succeed, and it is only by failing often that one can learn the most. Gracie also emphasizes the role of love in the human condition and how the love and support he received from his family and others helped him succeed.
