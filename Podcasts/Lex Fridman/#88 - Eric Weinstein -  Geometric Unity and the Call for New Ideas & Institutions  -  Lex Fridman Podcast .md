In this conversation with mathematician, Eric Weinstein, Alex Friedman discusses how the current global crisis compares to World War II and the 'great nap' period between the two wars. Weinstein argues that although the world has seen vast improvements in terms of technology and stability, we are still very vulnerable to disruptions.

00:05:00
Eric Weinstein discusses the apparent dichotomy between global suffering and the benefits of certain events, such as the moon landing. He argues that while both stories are true, the latter is more serious. He also points out that we are not taking the crisis seriously enough and that there are jurisdictional battles over who pays for personal protective equipment (PPE).

00:10:00
Eric Weinstein discusses geometric unity and the call for new ideas and institutions, noting that people are starting to become numb to the effects of job loss and business closures. He suggests that a community event, such as an election delay, could bring people together and help to rebuild democracy.

00:15:00
Eric Weinstein discusses the need for leaders and new ideas, and how the institutional narrative can limit the impact of new ideas. He argues that the key to gaining credibility and authority is to come from within the institutional narrative, and that being associated with prestigious institutions like MIT and Harvard helps.

00:20:00
Eric Weinstein discusses how the current political and economic systems are not conducive to creating a leader who can inspire change and overcome hardship. He believes that a revolution is possible, and points to the Russian Revolution of 1907 as an example.

00:25:00
The speaker discusses how the current political climate has led to a lack of innovation, and how a lack of innovation can lead to a decline in the quality of life. He calls for a revolt, and suggests that young people should take on the mantle of leadership after he is gone.

00:30:00
Eric Weinstein discusses the importance of freedom and honesty in the scientific community, and how the freaks, weirdos, and grifters often prove to be the strongest and most effective players in these situations.

00:35:00
Eric Weinstein discusses geometric unity and how it can be applied to problem solving in the public sphere. He discusses how the quality of one's lies has to be high in order to be reasonably honest with the population. He also speaks about how the tradition of remembering tragedy can help inspire competent leaders.

00:40:00
Eric Weinstein discusses his theory of geometric unity, which he has been working on for 30+ years. He explains that this theory is a work of life's work and that he is excited and scared to share it with the world. He urges others to be non-serious and show themselves to be leaders, not followers.

00:45:00
Eric Weinstein discusses his experiences as a mathematician and physicist and how he came to the conclusion that the field of theoretical physics is not actually trying to understand the nature of reality, but is instead focused on building tools and understanding the structure of complex systems. He discusses his theory of the observer's, which is a replacement for space-time that is both closely related to space time and not space-time. He talks about how he felt persecuted for even mentioning this idea, but eventually came out and shared his work with friends.

00:50:00
Eric Weinstein discusses geometric unity and the call for new ideas and institutions. He recalls an experience from seven years earlier in which he unsuccessfully attempted to release a book of his ideas. He believes that the current political climate is a perfect opportunity to release the book.

00:55:00
Eric Weinstein discusses the burden of criticism that can lead to the elimination of new ideas in academia. He shares the story of Andrew Wiles, who overcame immense pressure to complete a difficult mathematical proof. Weinstein rejects the idea that academics are implicitly agreement with the community about how things should be handled. He asks why the criticism of a failed academic idea is so important.

01:00:00
Eric Weinstein discusses the goals of geometric unity, which is the idea that mathematics should be able to describe everything, including matter. He argues that it is a theory where the questions beyond it are no longer of a mathematical nature.

01:05:00
Eric Weinstein discusses geometric unity and the call for new ideas and institutions. He argues that the standard way we tell the story of the universe, in which Einstein sets the canvas and then orders all the stuff, is not accurate. He suggests that we should view the universe as being generated by itself, and that we need to use mathematical tools to construct a consistent geometric theory in order to understand it. He discusses the possibility of artificial general intelligence becoming self-aware and taking over, and argues that these are two sides of the same coin.

01:10:00
In this video, Eric Weinstein discusses geometric unity and the call for new ideas and institutions. He argues that current theories about the universe are too limited and that new concepts are needed to fully understand the nature of reality. Weinstein suggests that we consider ten extra dimensions beyond the four we currently perceive, and suggests that we consider the concept of technical debt to help us manage our projects.

01:15:00
In this video, Eric Weinstein discusses the concept of spinners and how they are important in our world. He explains that spinners are one of the most profound aspects of human existence and you forgive him for the perhaps dumb questions.

01:20:00
Eric Weinstein discusses geometric unity and its various applications, including the Dirac equation. He notes that while most people are aware of geometric unity in theory, few are actually able to understand and apply it in their own lives.

01:25:00
Eric Weinstein discusses geometric unity and the call for new ideas and institutions. He argues that what has been available for over 90 years, can be distilled down to a blueprint that can be followed to understand it. Weinstein encourages others to jump out and say that he has the right to talk because his shtick about rulers and protractors leads to derivatives and measurements that look like what we see in everyday reality.

01:30:00
Eric Weinstein discusses geometric unity and the call for new ideas and institutions. He argues that the concepts of geometric unity and differential geometry can provide a foundation for a new physics, and that many of the challenges faced by physicists today can be addressed through further exploration of these ideas.

01:35:00
Eric Weinstein discusses geometric unity, which he believes is the key to unlocking new ideas and institutions. He describes the gap between theory and engineering, and how he is succeeding by not bowing down to professional communities or ignoring criticism.

01:40:00
Eric Weinstein discusses the idea of geometric unity and how it may have engineering prospects, but he cautions that it may be a death sentence if it is not right. He also discusses Elon Musk and his efforts to get off Earth, and whether or not he believes it is a physics or engineering problem.

01:45:00
Eric Weinstein discusses the idea of geometric unity and the call for new ideas and institutions. He believes that Elon Musk is doing a good job of exploring this field, but that there is more to be done. He suggests that MIT should focus on Aaron Schwartz, as he is one of the few people who has been through the system and knows what is needed to survive.

01:50:00
Eric Weinstein discusses the need for new ideas and institutions, and how PhDs should be treated as "outdoor cats" who should start taking back their power from the " indoor cats ", ie. those in academia.

01:55:00
Eric Weinstein discusses the need for new ideas and institutions in the face of technological revolutions. He says that the current system of academic institutions is not sustainable, and that individuals within these institutions need to be brave in order to fix it. He also speaks about the dangers of focusing on flaws in the system, and the need for leaders within these institutions to be trained in how to be professors.

02:00:00
Eric Weinstein discusses the fear that has plagued him for many years, and how therapy was able to help him deal with the fear. He urges other people to seek therapy if they are experiencing similar fear, as it can be very helpful.

02:05:00
Eric Weinstein discusses his experience of being betrayed by an authority figure, and how this experience has led him to question the efficacy of existing institutions. He discusses the problem of pervasive institutional betrayal, and how it can lead to a feeling of hopelessness. Weinstein discusses his insights into pervasive institutional betrayal and how they have helped him to develop a new ideology.

02:10:00
Eric Weinstein discusses how institutions can be helpful or harmful to society, and how the psychological burden of carrying this weight can be difficult to handle. He encourages people to have hope, even in the face of adversity, and to be willing to confront inequality and injustice within institutions.

02:15:00
Eric Weinstein discusses his time at Harvard, where he came to understand that the top brass at MIT have a different game plan than the average professor. He also talks about his struggles in trying to get his work published while at Harvard.

02:20:00
Eric Weinstein discusses how the academic system is complex and how it's not just about money. He goes on to say that there are broken aspects of the system and that it's up to individuals to either exit or acknowledge the game and try to win.

02:25:00
Eric Weinstein discusses geometric unity and the call for new ideas and institutions. He explains that the differential calculus let him show that students did not understand the self dual yang-mills equations correctly because they are in fact much more broadly found. He also points out that universities try to make sure students are viable and need their grants, and that this creates a system of interference competition that can lead to careers and dreams being taken away. Weinstein suggests that students need to be able to dance the dance floor to be on the view, and that when they go too far, they can get into more adversarial territory.

02:30:00
Eric Weinstein discusses geometric unity and the call for new ideas and institutions. He notes that this is a difficult concept to explain in a way that is comprehensible to laypeople, and that it is likely to generate a lot of criticism. Nevertheless, he remains hopeful that it will revolutionize our relationship with people outside of the institutional framework and reinforce into the institutional framework where we can do the most good.

02:35:00
Eric Weinstein discusses how he has had to break the rules of the academic system in order to pursue his own research goals, and how this has resulted in him having to deal with hostility and aggression from the system. He says that he is still looking for a better way to communicate with others, and that he has learned that it is important to maintain a sense of reality in his conversations.

02:40:00
Eric Weinstein discusses his experiences in the business world and how he has continuously broken out of the "powerhouse egos" and "brilliant no" mindset. He credits his success to listening to his "inner voice" and not succumbing to the fear of failure. He hopes that his legacy is one of accuracy and accomplishment, rather than how his community chose to remember him.

02:45:00
Eric Weinstein discusses geometric unity and the call for new ideas and institutions. He talks about how to keep things great in the world, and how to be a great mentor or friend.
