He also discusses the implications of a global economy, highlighting the importance of money in facilitating trade and the resulting increase in productivity.

00:20:00
Saifedean Ammous discusses the history of money, how gold became the standard, and how governments have adapted over time. He notes that while governments have not had to choose between gold and other forms of money, they have been pressured by the people to take on a particular form of money. This pressure has led to different types of money, such as hard money, which is difficult to produce, and soft money, which is easy to produce but not suitable for use as a monetary medium. Saifedean discusses the concept of the stock to flow ratio, which is a metric used to measure the ease of production of a particular commodity. He notes that while most metals are easy money, copper is not because it has stockpiles.

00:25:00
Saifedean Ammous argues that, due to the fact that paper money is backed by a belief that it has value, it can never have the same value as gold. He goes on to argue that, due to the current state of the world economy, most people are already living in a world where paper money has little value.

He argues that this is because diamonds are a luxury good that became popular after gold was banned as a means of ensuring a monopoly for the diamond producers.

00:40:00

Saifedean argues that this is a fundamentally flawed assumption and that in fact, too much government is bad for the economy.

00:45:00

00:55:00
Saifedean Ammous discusses the conflict between certainty and empirical evidence in economics, and how the Keynesian model is based on motivated reasoning.

He argues that, philosophically speaking, coercion is unethical, and that free markets are the best mechanism for achieving economic prosperity.

01:10:00

In 1914, the British government issued bonds to finance World War I. Only a third of the bonds were subscribed, leading to a financial crisis in the 1920s. In 2017, researchers discovered that the bank of England bought the remaining bonds, causing a financial crisis in the 1920s. This episode of the Lex Fridman podcast discusses the history of fiat money and the role of the bank of England in the financial crisis of the 1920s.

01:30:00
Saifedean Ammous discusses how the government financed World War I through buying bonds with borrowed money, and how this led to World War II. Keynesian economists believe that the government can always take more money from the population through taxation, but under the gold standard, this was not possible. Under the fiat standard, with paper money and credit money, governments could only take money from the population when they ran out of liquid wealth. Saifedean Ammous argues that these weaknesses in traditional economic thinking led to many wars in the 20th century. Winston Churchill and Saifedean Ammous step up to fight World War II, and the decision to do so may have been one of the key reasons that Hitler failed.
