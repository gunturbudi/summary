In the 20s and 30s, the Soviet Union forced farmers to collectivize their farms, breaking their individuality and incentive to work hard. This led to famines and chaos, and eventually led to the rise of Stalin. After Stalin took power, he began implementing policies aimed at improving the economy and stamping out dissent. One of these policies was the destruction of the kulaks, wealthy farmers who opposed Stalin's regime. This led to widespread famine and death, and eventually decreased the population's productivity and wealth.

02:10:00
The author discusses the Soviet Union's "red famine," which caused millions of people to starve to death. This famine was caused by Stalin's internal passport system, which prevented people from leaving their villages.

Jones believes that Hines was motivated to sign the book because of the pressure he was under to produce favorable reports about the USSR.
