# Summary of Lisa Feldman Barrett: How the Brain Creates Emotions |  MIT Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses how emotions are created in the brain and how different people have different emotions based on their neurotypical brains. Scientists still disagree about the basic building blocks of emotion, but Barrett believes that everyone has at least one emotion-triggered response.
Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses how the brain creates emotions, and how this ability is important for other mental events. She also points out that not all emotions are created equal, and that some emotions, such as love, are important for passing on genetic information. Barrett concludes the talk by emphasizing the importance of connection in life, and how it is necessary for both humans and machines to create and learn new things.

Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses the difference in the experience of emotion between an individual's expression and the emotion itself. She mentions that one common misconception is that one can look at someone's face and read their emotion.

Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses how emotion is created in the brain, and how different people have different emotions based on their neurotypical brains. Scientists still disagree about the basic building blocks of emotion, but Barrett believes that everyone has at least one emotion-triggered response.

00:10:00
Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses how the brain creates emotions, noting that some cultures don't have a concept for them. She argues that the question of what makes humans human is wrong to ask because emotions are a basic ingredient of the human brain, and that the key to building an intelligent agent is instilling these ingredients in it.

00:15:00
Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses the basics of emotion, discussing that emotions are simply "feelings" that are always with us, even if we're asleep or unconscious. She also discusses the brain's role in controlling body systems, and how certain regions of the brain are responsible for representing sensory consequences of changes in those systems.

00:20:00
Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses how the brain creates emotions, stating that while emotions are not real in the sense that they do not exist as physical entities, they are real in the sense that the physical meaning of the signal is endowed in the signal.

00:25:00
Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses how the brain creates emotions, how social realities are learned and how they play into our physical health. She also discusses how machine learning methods need ground truth to function correctly, and how emotions are learned to fit into our culture.

00:30:00
According to Lisa Feldman Barrett, infants learn to form abstract concepts, such as rules and money, through exposure to words and physical signals.

00:35:00
Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses how the brain creates emotions, citing categories that we use in everyday life, as well as the sensory arrays that those categories imply. Barrett also discusses how the brain uses past experiences to make guesses about future sensory cues.

00:40:00
Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses the role of dopamine in motivation and reward, and how this is important for creatures such as humans. She also discusses the idea of love as a social construct and how it varies across different cultures. Barrett finishes by discussing how a machine that could fall in love with humans would need to regulate other people's nervous systems in order to do so.

00:45:00
Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses how the brain creates emotions, how attachment comes from an infant's relationship with a caregiver, and how support helps to keep someone's brain in a low state of stasis.

00:50:00
Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses how the brain creates emotions, how the need for novelty is balanced by its cost, and how different nervous systems can bear different amounts of cost.

00:55:00
Lisa Feldman Barrett argues that emotions are implemented by a variety of biochemical signals in the brain, which are inherited from our ancestors. She believes that building artificial intelligence that is similar to human intelligence will require understanding how emotions are implemented in the brain.

01:00:00
Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses how the brain creates emotions, citing serotonin, oxytocin, and opioids as important players. She argues that emotions are implemented as a series of "hacks" rather than being maladaptive, and that opioids are an important part of this process.

01:05:00
Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses the brain's ability to create emotions, and how this ability is important for other mental events. She also points out that not all emotions are created equal, and that some emotions, such as love, are important for passing on genetic information. Barrett concludes the talk by emphasizing the importance of connection in life, and how it is necessary for both humans and machines to create and learn new things.

01:10:00
Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses how the brain creates emotions, and how dogs are able toexpress emotions in a way that cats cannot. She believes that this is due to some drive or mechanism that allows them to learn this skill.

01:15:00
Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses the idea that dogs may have some capacities that are unique to human beings, such as the ability to move their facial muscles and communicate with others through joint attention and gaze.
