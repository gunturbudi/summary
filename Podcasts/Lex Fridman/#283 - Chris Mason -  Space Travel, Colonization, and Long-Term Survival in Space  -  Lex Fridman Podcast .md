The study found that astronauts' telomeres tended to lengthen in space, which may indicate that spaceflight has a potential antioxidant effect.

00:55:00
Space travel has been shown to be a risk factor for various diseases and conditions, including radiation exposure. Researchers are working on ways to adapt the human body to stress of space travel. One potential milestone in this process is the development of epigenetic Crispr therapies, which could be used topreemptively activate dna repair genes and treat diseases on earth.
