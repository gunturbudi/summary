# Summary of Bjarne Stroustrup: Learn More than One Programming Language

Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, stresses the significance of learning multiple programming languages for professional programmers. Stroustrup argues that the knowledge of both high-level languages, like C++, and machine code is essential for creating maintainable and scalable code that can be optimized. Moreover, he highlights that knowing different languages, such as functional languages and JavaScript, Python, or Ruby, helps to develop unique perspectives and improves overall programming skills. Additionally, Stroustrup points out that low-level language knowledge is not always required, and clean code can be achieved using abstraction mechanisms provided by high-level languages.

In this section, Bjarne Stroustrup discusses the importance of knowing multiple programming languages as a professional programmer. He mentions that he knew about 25 languages when he did C++, and it is good to learn as many languages as possible because it helps you think and become a better programmer. While he initially listed C++, Java, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript as important languages, he emphasizes that the number is not essential. Stroustrup also discusses the benefits of knowing low-level languages like machine code to understand machine architecture and performance optimization. However, he points out that going low-level is not always necessary for better performance, and clean code can be achieved using abstraction mechanisms offered by high-level languages like C++. Finally, he shares an example of how a programmer used C++ to write Pong and concurrently translated the code into a lower-level language.

In this section, Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, discusses the importance of learning more than one programming language. He argues that knowledge of machine code and C++ is essential for creating clean and maintainable code that can be efficiently optimized. Additionally, he suggests that functional languages like Pig or Pralaya Male can help developers express mathematical notions clearly and employ strict type systems, while languages like JavaScript, Python, or Ruby are useful for quickly churning out code. Ultimately, Stroustrup believes that learning multiple languages can benefit developers by providing them with different perspectives that improve their overall programming skills.
