Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Sam Harris discusses the origins of thoughts and consciousness, free will, and neuroscience in this conversation with Lex Fridman.

00:05:00
The video discusses the question of consciousness, free will, and psychedelics. It argues that it is difficult to get closer to the root of thoughts due to the subjective experience of them popping out of nowhere. psychedelics may open up a landscape of mind, but there is no place from which one is getting closer to the root of consciousness. This undermines the notion of getting closer to something "to the datum of your mind."

00:10:00
Sam Harris discusses consciousness, free will, psychedelics, AI, UFOs, and meaning in this Lex Fridman podcast. He argues that consciousness may be fundamental to reality and that it might not be possible to distinguish between a failure of memory and an interruption of consciousness. He is agnostic on the question of whether panpsychism is true, but believes that it is an interesting idea to consider.

00:15:00
Sam Harris discusses consciousness, free will, psychedelics, AI, UFOs, and meaning. He believes that consciousness is prior to a differentiating self and other and that it is likely not limited to humans. He also believes that contemplation of mortality creates consciousness.

00:20:00
In this YouTube video, Sam Harris discusses consciousness, free will, psychedelics, AI, UFOs, and meaning. He argues that, although babies are not consciously aware, they are capable of treating others kindly before they have language. Additionally, psychedelics can temporarily obviate the need for language, allowing for a more holistic experience. Coming down from a psychedelic experience can be difficult due to the overwhelming amount of meaning and information that is experienced.

00:25:00
In this video, Sam Harris discusses the potential of psychedelics in terms of consciousness, free will, and meaning. He explains that while some people have a full psychedelic experience, for others it is unpleasant and leaves them with little recollection of what happened. He also comments on the idea of 'self-transforming machine elves' that people sometimes experience on psychedelics.

00:30:00
In this video, Sam Harris discusses consciousness, free will, psychedelics, AI, UFOs, and meaning. He mentions that lucid dreaming provides evidence that the mind is not capable of doing everything it thinks it might be capable of and that in math on LSD, the brain is able to think deeply and creatively.

00:35:00
Sam Harris discusses the theory that reality is just consciousness and how psychedelics might alter one's perspective on reality. He also discusses the philosophical implications of this theory.

00:40:00
In this video, Sam Harris discusses the possibility that reality is not as we experience it, and that consciousness may be the one element that makes it all come together. He also discusses the implications of this idea on our understanding of reality and our place in it.

00:45:00
Sam Harris discusses the idea that reality is just a subset of the full reality, and that humans are just too dumb by design to understand much of it. He argues that this is why science has made little progress in the past, and that scientists need to realize that evolution does not require humans to understand reality perfectly.

00:50:00
Sam Harris discusses the idea that free will is an illusion, and that the experience of free will is also an illusion.

00:55:00
According to Sam Harris, the illusion of free will is an illusion in that as you pay more attention to your experience, you begin to see that it's totally compatible with an absence of free will. He goes on to say that this realization is incredibly freeing, as it cuts through the illusion of the self and frees you from the psychological basis for hatred.

01:00:00
Sam Harris discusses the concepts of consciousness, self, and free will and how they are all illusions. He argues that consciousness cannot be an illusion because any illusion proves its reality as much as any other vertical perception. He also argues that self is an illusion because it's impossible to be confused about the underlying claim of whether you make it linguistically or not. Finally, he argues that free will is an illusion because most people mean something different by it and it could be worse than creating a person who's miserable.

01:05:00
Sam Harris discusses the paradox of free will and its relationship to self-awareness. He points out that the experience of selfhood and subjectivity is born from not paying close attention to what it's like to be you.

01:15:00

In this video, Sam Harris discusses consciousness, free will, and the illusion of free will. He argues that people feel like they could have done otherwise right, and that this is the illusion of free will. He goes on to discuss cellular automata and how simple rules can create incredible complexity. He argues that this is analogous to the case of ghosts, where there is no description of any concatenation of causes that precedes the experience of consciousness. He concludes the video by saying that free will is not like this at all and is instead an illusion.

01:25:00

01:30:00

01:35:00
Sam Harris discusses the idea that anger is divorced from hatred, and that both are harmful states of mind. He argues that we should strive to rid ourselves of anger and hatred, as they are self-destructive and ultimately useless.

01:40:00
