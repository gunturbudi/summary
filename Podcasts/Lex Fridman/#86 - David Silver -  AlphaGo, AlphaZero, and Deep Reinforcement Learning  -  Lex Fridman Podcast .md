David Silver discusses his work in the field of reinforcement learning and AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and Deep Reinforcement Learning. He talks about the first program he ever wrote, and how he thought about computers at the time. He also discusses how MasterClass can help people learn about technology and robotics in a fun and immersive way.

00:05:00
David Silver discusses his fascination with artificial intelligence, his early experiences with computer programming, and how he eventually became interested in learning how to create artificial intelligence. He recalls his experience of beating a professional gamer at a game using reinforcement learning, and how it made him feel.

00:10:00
David Silver is the creator of the AlphaGo artificial intelligence system, which achieved human-level playing ability in the game of Go. He shares his inspiration and journey in creating AlphaGo and the subsequent developments in artificial intelligence.

00:15:00
David Silver, a nine-year-old child, solved a computer game, Go, that no adult could beat. He then turned his attention to learning reinforcement learning, which is a difficult problem. Reinforcement learning requires understanding what the goal is for the system, and learning how to achieve it. With reinforcement learning, the system can learn how to achieve its goals without being programmed. This is a difficult problem, and the state of the art is still not good enough to achieve human-level performance in Go. However, Silver believes that with the right learning methods, reinforcement learning can eventually achieve this goal.

00:20:00
David Silver discusses AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and Deep Reinforcement Learning. He notes that the game of Go has simple rules, but immense complexity, and that human go players have played it for thousands of years and built up its immense knowledge base. Silver contrasts Go with chess, noting that the evaluation of a particular static board is not as reliable as in chess. He discusses strong levels of play happening very rarely, and how intuition and knowledge of the game determine a player's success.

00:25:00
David Silver discusses the importance of reinforcement learning and its relation to intelligence, highlighting that the problem of intelligence can be formalized as the reinforcement learning problem and that there may be better approaches still to be developed.

00:30:00
In this video, David Silver discusses the basics of reinforcement learning, which is the study of how agents learn to achieve desired outcomes in their environment by taking actions and measuring the results. There are three fundamental pieces of the reinforcement learning puzzle that are often used in different ways to solve the problem: what is modeled explicitly (e.g. predicting future rewards), what is represented implicitly (e.g. learning a policy), and what is learned implicitly (e.g. learning to adjust parameters of a system). All three of these components are necessary in order for an agent to achieve good performance in a complex environment.

00:35:00
In this video, David Silver discusses AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and deep reinforcement learning. He notes that deep reinforcement learning is one family of solution feds that tries to utilize powerful representations that are offered by neural networks. He believes that deep learning is beautiful and surprising, and that despite its nonlinear surfaces, it continues to perform well.

00:40:00
In this video, David Silver discusses how AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and deep reinforcement learning work. He also explains how these technologies can be used to solve problems that were previously thought to be insurmountable.

00:45:00
David Silver, a computer scientist, talks about AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and Deep Reinforcement Learning. AlphaGo was developed by Deep Mind, and AlphaZero was a program that beat a world champion Go player without human input.

00:50:00
David Silver discusses AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and deep reinforcement learning in a podcast with Lex Fridman. AlphaGo was able to beat a world champion human player, and the team decided to challenge the world champion. Alphago used both learning from experts and self play to achieve this.

00:55:00
David Silver, a computer scientist and artificial intelligence researcher, discusses AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and deep reinforcement learning. He explains that the AlphaGo victory was a significant moment in the history of artificial intelligence, and that the team was confident but aware of the potential ramifications of the accomplishment.

01:00:00
The video discusses the Deep reinforcement learning algorithms used by AlphaGo and AlphaZero, and how they managed to achieve impressive victories against world champions. It also discusses the third game played against a world champion, in which AlphaGo found a brilliant sequence that saved the game for Lisa Doll.

01:05:00
David Silver, a researcher at Google DeepMind, discusses AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and deep reinforcement learning. He explains that while AlphaGo lost to Garry Kasparov in a match, it was a success overall because it marked a transformative moment for artificial intelligence. Silver also notes that he spent time at Triple AI, a conference jointly organized by DeepMind and the USC Computer Science Department, with Garry Kasparov.

01:10:00
David Silver, a computer scientist, discusses AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and Deep Reinforcement Learning. He describes how AlphaGo and AlphaZero were able to defeat world-class chess programs, and how Deep Reinforcement Learning is making progress in other areas. He talks about how learning is the key to creating artificial intelligence that is able to understand the world and make decisions on its own.

01:15:00
AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and Deep Reinforcement Learning are all technologies that aim to create artificial intelligence that can learn for itself. AlphaGo was the first AI to achieve human-level playing skills at the game of Go, and AlphaZero was the first AI to achieve artificial general intelligence. Lex Fridman discusses the significance of these technologies and how they may pave the way for even more advanced AI.

01:20:00
David Silver discusses AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and deep reinforcement learning, noting that while the former two systems were powerful, the latter was more surprising and had the potential to reach even higher levels of knowledge. He proposes a falsifiable hypothesis that if AlphaGo is run on increased computational resources, it will be able to surpass the previous version of AlphaGo by 100 games to zero.

01:25:00
David Silver discusses alphaGo, AlphaZero, and deep reinforcement learning. AlphaGo was able to beat a world champion at the game of Go, and AlphaZero was able to beat a world champion at the game of Go without any human training. AlphaGo and AlphaZero show that it is possible to achieve superhuman performance in complex games without human training. The next step is to generalize this to other domains.

01:30:00
David Silver discusses AlphaGo's and AlphaZero's superhuman performances in Go and Shogi, and how these demonstrate the potential of reinforcement learning. He also describes the essential process of creativity, which can be seen in AlphaGo's and AlphaZero's discoveries of new joseki.

01:35:00
David Silver discusses AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and Deep Reinforcement Learning. He notes that AlphaGo and AlphaZero demonstrated that humans can discover patterns that we humans do, and that these insights can be applied in other domains. He also points out that intrinsic rewards are a possibility when we don't know how to specify a reward explicitly. He believes that intelligence can be understood in terms of ultimate goals that a system seeks to achieve.

01:40:00
David Silver discusses AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and Deep Reinforcement Learning and argues that, in order to build intelligent systems, it is important to understand what the reward function is for humans. He also refers to evolution as a mechanism for dispersing energy and achieving a goal.

01:45:00
David Silver discusses AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and deep reinforcement learning. He explains that deep learning has enabled machines to learn for themselves and create systems that can achieve goals more effectively than humans can. He believes that we are at a turning point where machine intelligence is starting to understand some abilities traditionally thought to be reserved for humans.
