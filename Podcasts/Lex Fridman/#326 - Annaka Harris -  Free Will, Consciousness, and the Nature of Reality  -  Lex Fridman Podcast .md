Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Annaka Harris discusses the nature of Free Will and Consciousness and how they are illusions. She discusses the example of a rock being thrown into a pond and how the appearance of free will is an illusion. She advises scientists to shake up their intuitions and be open to new ideas.

00:05:00
Annaka Harris discusses the difficulties in thinking about free will, consciousness, and the nature of reality. She discusses how writing helps her to clear her thoughts and come to conclusions more quickly. She also discusses her interest in Flat Earth theory and how it challenges mainstream assumptions.

00:10:00
Annaka Harris discusses how our intuitions can be incorrect and how studying the brain can help us figure out free will and conscious will. She provides an analogy of a plant and how its behavior can be used to help understand how we might think differently about ourselves and our own consciousness.

00:15:00
Annaka Harris discusses free will and consciousness in relation to the nature of reality. She explains that a plant's ability to coil and grow in a different way depending on whether it is in the light or dark is an example of a primitive form of memory. She goes on to say that when we make decisions, our human brain is much more complex than a plant's, and that this complexity can lead to an illusion of free will.

00:20:00
Annika Harris discusses the nature of reality and free will, emphasizing the importance of understanding how our brain and body work as a system. She also points out the difference between involuntary and voluntary behavior, and explains why some people feel creeped out by her statements.

00:25:00
Annaka Harris discusses the idea of free will, consciousness, and the nature of reality. She argues that the illusion of free will is a cultural construct that affects how we think. She also discusses the idea of a fundamental self, which is unaffected by memories or memories of past experiences.

00:40:00
Annaka Harris discusses free will, consciousness, and the nature of reality, noting that some ideas about these matters may initially seem crazy, but that all of the big scientific breakthroughs are ultimately true. She suggests that mental illness can be seen as a different category from truth, and that being open to counter-intuitive ideas is a key part of a healthy mind.

00:45:00
Annaka Harris discusses the idea that there is something special about humans that makes us unique compared to other species on Earth. She then discusses the idea that Consciousness could arise from complex processing, and argues that this is just a fascinating fact all on its own.

00:50:00
Annaka Harris discusses free will, consciousness, and the nature of reality in this Lex Fridman podcast. She argues that all or some consciousness must exist, as it is impossible for there to be no experience or consciousness in the universe. Consciousness may also arise gradually or for the first time in certain complex brains.

00:55:00
Annaka Harris discusses the possible existence of felt experience in all matter, the challenges of investigating Consciousness scientifically, and her belief that both science and intuition will help us to better understand this mysterious phenomenon.

01:00:00
Annaka Harris discusses her work investigating the nature of consciousness, and argues that it may be fundamental rather than emerging. She also discusses her interest in the IIT and their work in consciousness.

01:05:00
Annaka Harris discusses the nature of Consciousness, free will, and the binding process between sensory information and Consciousness. She argues that Consciousness is fundamental to our experience of free will and that scientific advancements in neuroscience may one day support the idea that Consciousness is at the end of a lot of brain processing.

01:10:00
Annaka Harris discusses free will and consciousness, and suggests that our experience of free will is an illusion created by the brain. She also discusses studies that suggest the neuroscience of free will is inevitably going to get better.

01:15:00
Annaka Harris discusses the findings of neuroscience that suggest that the sense of self is an illusion and that we are in fact connected to the rest of nature. She believes that this realization can have a positive effect on human psychology, especially in terms of reducing rates of depression and anxiety.

01:20:00
Annaka Harris discusses the idea that humans are fascinated by truth, and how this can lead to positive psychological states, such as a sense of meaning and purpose. She also speaks about her own experiences with depression and how she was able to overcome it.

01:25:00
Annaka Harris explains that she has always been very sensitive, and that her anxiety has led to the diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. She shares her experience of recovering from postpartum depression, and how it was helpful to learn more about her own psychology. After recovering from postpartum depression, she realized that her anxiety had been a part of her life for as long as she could remember. She also learned about the role that childhood trauma can play in the development of anxiety disorders.

01:30:00
Annaka Harris discusses the usefulness of illusions, specifically those of consciousness, in various scientific studies. She also discusses the importance of being aware of the illusions we create and living in the moment.

01:35:00
Annaka Harris discusses free will, consciousness, and the nature of reality with Lex Fridman. She discusses the importance of therapy and medication for those suffering from anxiety and depression, and how psychedelics can be a helpful tool in treating those conditions.

01:50:00
Annaka Harris discusses the difference between how we experience reality when we are conscious and when we are not, and how meditation can help us to experience reality more purely. She also discusses the idea that thoughts and feelings arise in the same way that physical sensations do, and that when we are simply paying attention to what is happening in the present moment, we can gain insights that align with science.

01:55:00
Annaka Harris discusses the nature of Consciousness and free will. She agrees that Consciousness may be fundamental, but has issues with Don Hoffman's terminology.

02:00:00
Annaka Harris discusses free will and consciousness, and argues that everything we experience is a controlled hallucination. Harris also quotes Anil Seth, a neuroscientist, who says that everything we experience, including space and time, is an illusion.

02:05:00
Annaka Harris discusses the idea that reality may be contained within a two-dimensional space, and that this space may be projected onto a three-dimensional surface. She argues that this surface is an illusion, and that what we experience as space is actually referencing something deeper.

02:10:00
Annaka Harris discusses free will, consciousness, and the nature of reality. She writes about how time may be emergent, and how consciousness may be fundamental. She also discusses the Google AI engineer and how the term "AI" is not used amongst machine learning people.

Annaka Harris, a Google AI engineer, believes that a chatbot could be conscious, and that ethics is about "suffering and well-being."

02:20:00
Annaka Harris discusses the nature of consciousness, free will, and the zombie thought experiment. She explains that, while the zombie thought experiment is useful for exploring questions about consciousness, it is not the only way to do so.

Annaka Harris discusses the nature of consciousness and how it plays a role in the human condition. She argues that consciousness is analogous to a boiling pot of water, with the bubbles representing our conscious experiences.

02:30:00
Annaka Harris discusses the idea that experiences are happening to something or to someone, dropping out to what you get is just experiences arising, and the fundamental nature of the universe which obeys laws, but which you get out of that are appearances of different conscious experiences. She talks about how, in the view that Consciousness is not necessary, the same view can be had without suffering, and that, in the view that suffering is a deep part of human history, it seems that it is built in to nature. Finally, she discusses the meaning of life and how, for her, it is not a question for the body and mind system called Annaka Colonica, but for whatever you are plugged into.
