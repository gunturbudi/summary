Please check out our sponsors in the description and now here's my conversation with Kelsi Sharon. You mentioned that studying history had a big impact on you, and your grandfather was a World War II vet. So, people that have gone through World War II in my family too, they don't seem to talk about it much. Like the worse the tragedy, the less they talk about it. I mean, it's understandable. I can respect that. But, I don't think people fully understood the value in human stories over time and sharing that, that certain civilizations don't have written language, the value in that being passed down is extraordinary. We didn't really have that with the World War II vets it seems like. They kind of want to protect you from the pain. My grandfather, my grandmother
