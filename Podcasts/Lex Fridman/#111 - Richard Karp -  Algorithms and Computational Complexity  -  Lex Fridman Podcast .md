Professor Richard Karp discusses the impact of his work on algorithms and computational complexity, including the development of the admiration carp algorithm for solving the max flow problem on networks, the Hopcroft Corp algorithm for finding maximum cardinality matchings in bipartite graphs, and his landmark paper and complexity theory called reducibility. He also discusses his experience as a student, when he came across a problem in geometry that was solved using formal proofs.

00:05:00
Richard Karp discusses the elegance of geometry, and how it is a fact that reasoning can establish results about geometry beyond dispute. He also talks about his experiences with solving puzzles in geometry, and how he relies on algebra to help him think about the algorithms he is working with.

00:10:00
Richard Karp discusses algorithms and how they work. He discusses how an algorithm can be simplified to a series of simple motions, and how this can be applied to problems on the computer. He discusses the assignment problem and how the hungarian algorithm can be used to find the optimal assignment.

00:15:00
Richard Karp discusses algorithms and computational complexity, explaining that the beauty of such an innovative process lies in its simplicity. He recalls enjoying showing off his mathematical skills to friends by multiplying four-digit numbers. Karp discusses his current work as a professor of computer science at Stevens Institute of Technology.

00:20:00
Richard Karp discusses the attraction of mathematics to computer scientists and math magicians, and how these people are not necessarily endowed with emotional intelligence. He talks about how in the 1950s, computers like the UNIVAC were already in use in the laboratory at Harvard. He shares that his mother influenced him to get into data processing, and how he at the time did not imagine that personal computing would be a big industry.

00:25:00
Richard Karp discusses the possibility of human level intelligence being achievable through the development of algorithms that reason and appear to us to have the same kind of intelligence as humans. He raises doubts about this prospect, however, citing the difficulty of understanding the operation of the human brain and the lack of evidence that such an achievement is possible.

00:30:00
In this video, Richard Karp discusses combinatorial algorithms, which aim to solve problems by arranging discrete objects in a way that minimizes a cost function. He points out that although exponential growth could lead to machines that are vastly more intelligent than humans, it is also possible that intelligence is actually much harder to achieve.

00:35:00
In this video, Richard Karp explains algorithms and computational complexity. He discusses the objectives of combinatorial algorithms, such as scheduling classes in a school, and explains how network flows can be mapped into these algorithms. He also talks about the problem of determining the maximum rate at which information can flow through a network.

00:40:00
Richard Karp discusses algorithms and computational complexity. He discusses how an algorithm is defined, and discusses how polynomial time algorithms fit into this category. He also discusses NP-complete problems and their status as efficient algorithms.

00:45:00
The video discusses the difference between problems that are polynomial in time to solve (NP problems) and those that are not (P problems). NP problems are those that are easy to verify, but may be hard to solve, while P problems are those that are hard to solve, but easy to verify. Finally, the presenter provides an example of a non-deterministic polynomial time algorithm, which is harder to solve than finding the solution.

00:50:00
Richard Karp discusses the theory of computational complexity and its relationship to the problem of p versus np. He argues that p is not equal to np, and that many difficult problems in computational complexity theory are equivalent to problems in polynomial time.

00:55:00
Richard Karp explains how the propositional logic problem can be translated into a problem in NP, which is a field of computer science focused on determining whether a given algorithm can be solved. This proof provides a fundamental understanding of how many problems in NP can be solved, and how simple some of these problems may be.

01:00:00
The problem of finding a clique of a given size in a graph can be expressed as a number of clauses each of which is a of the form a or b or c where a is either one of the variables in the problem or the negation of one of the variables. To solve the problem, you must find one of the terms in each clause which is given that which is true in your truth assignment, but you can't make the same variable both true and false.

01:05:00
In this video, Richard Karp discusses the expressive power of algorithms and computational complexity. He states that any one of the 21 problems he studied can be re-expressed as another with the same expressive power, and that the two fields are closely related. NP completeness and hardness classes are discussed as a small technicality.

01:10:00
The stable matching problem is a combinatorial problem that is difficult to solve efficiently, but has applications in many real-life situations.

01:15:00
In this video, Richard Karp discusses algorithms and computational complexity. He notes that a stable matching exists and can be computed by a simple algorithm. He points out that, in the context of matching residents to hospitals, the best result is for the husband and wife to be assigned to the same hospital.

01:20:00
The video discusses the Raven carp algorithm, which is an example of a randomized algorithm. This algorithm is easy to compute, has low probability of error, and is useful for string matching.

01:25:00
Richard Karp discusses the concept of randomness and how it can be used to create simple algorithms. He also discusses the concept of prime numbers and how they can be tested using randomness.

01:30:00
The video discusses the use of randomized algorithms to count solutions to formulas, and the importance of worst case analysis. It also discusses the power of average case analysis and how it can be used to predict the future of theoretical computer science.

01:35:00
The video discusses the algorithms used to solve instances of satisfiability problems, emphasizing the importance of average case analysis. The author also discusses the work done in the community to show that these algorithms are likely to find solutions with high probability.

01:40:00
Richard Karp discusses the difficulty of publishing successful papers in theoretical computer science that show success on real-world data sets. He cites the growing availability of large data sets as a potential obstacle to this goal.

01:45:00
In this talk, Professor Richard Karp explains that if problems have small circuits, then complexity theory would collapse down to the second level. This would be evidence that some level of complexity is too complex to solve.

01:50:00
Machine learning is a field of study that deals with the training and application of artificial intelligence algorithms. One of the key challenges in this field is the difficulty in understanding the algorithms' outputs, as they are typically computable functions of the input.

01:55:00
Richard Karp discusses the challenges of modeling and optimizing biological systems, as well as the potential for algorithms in this field. He also discusses the ethical implications of gene editing.

02:00:00
Richard Karp discusses the importance of preparation for a teacher, suggests that different students need different levels of influence, and describes some of the algorithms and computer science concepts that have had a major impact on his teaching career.

02:05:00
In this interview, Richard Karp discusses his work on algorithms and computational complexity. He discusses how his work has made him realize his ability, and how he's now focused on helping others pursue their dreams. He thanks the interviewer for their time and ends with a quote from Isaac Asimov.
