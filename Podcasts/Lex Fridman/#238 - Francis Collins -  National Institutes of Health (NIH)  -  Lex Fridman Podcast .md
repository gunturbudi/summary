In this conversation with Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, Lex Fridman discusses the importance of scientific inquiry, the risks and benefits of conducting gain of function research in response to public health threats, and the difficulties of reconciling scientific findings with ethical considerations.

00:05:00
Francis Collins, the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), discusses the stricter oversight of experiments that may increase the transmissibility or virulence of human pathogens, known as "enhanced potential pandemic pathogen" or "epp." Collins stresses that these experiments must be approved by a panel beyond NIH and that, out of the last three or four instances of experiments being given permission to go forward, only one involved an influenza virus.

00:10:00
In this YouTube video, Francis Collins discusses the NIH's study of bat viruses and their potential link to SARS. Collins notes that the bat viruses studied had very little similarity to SARS-CoV2, and that any claims that these viruses caused SARS are baseless. He discusses the gray areas of science, and points out that while scientists may be taking risks with experiments, they must also be aware of the potential consequences. He also touches on the ethics of risk-taking.

00:15:00
Francis Collins discusses the risks and benefits of gain of function research, which has been a concern of many people for a decade or more. He says that if the research doesn't need to be done in a high-security laboratory, it becomes a greater risk. He also talks about the importance of tracking unethical behavior and the lack of an international collaboration to prevent bioweapons from being created.

00:20:00
Director of the National Institutes of Health, Francis Collins, discusses the importance of biosecurity when working with potential pandemic viruses, the difficult questions that need to be answered before such research can continue, and his belief that Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, should not be fired for his changing views on a potential pandemic virus.

00:25:00
Francis Collins discusses how he believes that humility would not change the fact that the NIH is looking for a target of someone to blame for the failures of their political party. Collins also discusses how Tony Fauci has said multiple times that the recommendation not to wear masks was for two reasons - a shortage of masks and a lack of realization early in the course of the epidemic that this was a virus that could heavily infect asymptomatic people. Collins also discusses how communication of science with the world is a philosophical, ethical, and practical question.

00:30:00
In this interview, Francis Collins discusses the importance of information and how to make difficult decisions while staying true to scientific data. He also discusses the current vaccine controversy and how to combat false information.

00:35:00
The video discusses Francis Collins's concerns about the current state of scientific discourse, which he believes is characterized by a lack of trust in those who speak with an authoritarian tone. He also brings up Joe Rogan, who has been attacked for his views on vaccines despite the lack of evidence to support either position. The study mentioned in the video is Active Six, which is a study looking at the effectiveness of ivermectin for the treatment of Covin19.

He also discusses how low- and middle-income countries are not yet benefiting from the availability of vaccines, and how the Obama administration is emphasizing the scaling of vaccine manufacturers.

00:50:00
In this video, Francis Collins discusses the NIH's decision to end all biomedical research involving chimpanzees. He notes that this was a difficult decision, but it was based on a lot of deep thinking and input from people who are familiar with the issue.

00:55:00
In this video, Francis Collins discusses some of the things he is most proud of during his time as director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). He mentions the progress that has been made in the field of gene editing, single cell biology, and understanding the human brain. He also notes that he will be stepping down from his position at the end of the year.

01:00:00
