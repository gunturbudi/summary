00:10:00
James Gosling discusses his early days programming on a PDP-8, how he became interested in theoretical computer science, and how he sees code visually. He also discusses how programming style can affect readability and how he sometimes has to talk his engineers out of using dense formatting.

00:15:00
James Gosling recalls his early days of computing, when he worked on a 4k-of-ram, low-powered machine at the University of Calgary. With exponential improvements in technology, Gosling marvels at how much more powerful computers have become. Gosling also discusses how accessible programming is and how anyone can build something cool with a computer.

00:20:00
James Gosling talks about his early days programming, his first programming language, and his appreciation for Lisp.

00:25:00
James Gosling discusses his early experiences with programming, including his work on the first object-oriented language, Simula. He also discusses the impact of his work on Emacs, which was influential in the development of modern programming languages.

00:30:00
James Gosling discusses his experience working on early computer programs, including his work on the pascal compiler for Multix and his work on Emacs. Gosling notes that Emacs was a better editor than any other available at the time, and that its popularity led to its widespread use on the ARPANET.

00:35:00
James Gosling discusses his experience working on early computer projects, including his work on the ARPANET and the early days of the internet. He notes that while the internet has changed significantly over the years, the fundamental technologies behind it have not changed much.

00:40:00
The early days of computing saw a battle between companies who relied on cable TV to capture eyeballs and those who saw the internet as a way to distribute content directly to customers. Sun, a company which was working on internet technologies at the time, submitted a proposal to the cable companies that suggested anyone could become a publisher. Although the cable companies were initially resistant to the idea, they eventually realized that the future of their business was in jeopardy and made a strategic decision to transition to digital media.

00:45:00
James Gosling discusses his experience as a software engineer and how it prepared him for leading technology companies. He discusses the early days of personal computing and how Kodak's transition to digital photography was a difficult one. He talks about the importance of visionary leadership and how Tesla and Amazon have succeeded despite taking significant hits to their stock prices.

00:50:00
James Gosling discusses his early years in computer technology, and how he developed a strong vision and leadership skills despite being a jerk to his employees. He credits Jobs' attitude and approach to success as an inspiration to others.

00:55:00
James Gosling discusses his experience with open source, licensing, and regret. He is a big fan of open source, and believes it has many benefits.

01:00:00
James Gosling talks about the early days of open source and how it became a religion. He says that he gets weird about open source because it's like saying that all software engineers must take a vow of poverty. He also talks about the decision he made to focus on one project instead of being a multiple project developer.

01:05:00
In this interview, James Gosling talks about his experience developing Java and JVM software, working on Emacs, and the early days of computing. He also has a disagreement with Richard Stallman over the issue of free software.

01:10:00
Java was created in 1990 by a group of Sun employees worried about the state of computing outside of the computer industry. The language was designed to make it easier to write code for different types of computing devices. Java has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

01:15:00
In the 1990s, software engineer James Gosling and his team developed a demo project for home electronics in order to learn about best practices in programming. They discovered that some aspects of standard programming practice were getting in the way of achieving desired results, and they developed a new way of doing things that was later adopted by the industry.

01:20:00
James Gosling discusses his early days in computing and how Java came about. Java was created to address the problems of safety and speed in software development.

01:25:00
James Gosling discusses his early days as a programmer and how he developed Java, the JVM, and other programming languages. He also discusses how the JVM can be viewed as an encoding of an abstract machine, and how this helps developers understand and debug code.

01:30:00
In the early 1990s, computer manufacturers were discussing consumer electronics with purchasing people. One conversation revolved around the fact that different generations of CPUs had different instruction caches, which made software development harder. James Gosling had a "eureka moment" while recalling a summer job he had during graduate school where he redesigned an instruction cache on a CPU.

01:35:00
James Gosling discusses his work on a machine translation tool for software written in Pascal toAssembly for early microprocessors.

01:40:00
James Gosling discusses his early days of computing, his time working on Java for cell phones, and his thoughts on the current state of Java. He also talks about his experiences with Intel and Android. Gosling concludes by saying that he is happy with the way Java is being used, and that there are some things he wishes were different about the way it is used on Android.

01:45:00
James Gosling, the creator of Java, discusses the importance of risk-taking and the influence of science fiction on his career. He also discusses his favorite AI systems and why Star Trek tops his list.

01:50:00
James Gosling, one of the pioneers of modern computing, chats with Lex Friedman about his experiences in the industry. Gosling discusses his experiences with Java, the JVM, Emacs, and early days of computing. He thanks listeners for their time, and encourages them to subscribe to the podcast, review it on Apple podcasts, and follow Friedman on Twitter.
