# Summary of David Eagleman: Neuroplasticity and the Livewired Brain | Lex Fridman Podcast #119

In the video, David Eagleman discusses neuroplasticity and how it affects our ability to learn and adapt. He argues that different parts of the brain have different plasticity windows, which determines how fast something hardens into place. He also discusses how the brain is constantly rewiring itself to adapt to the environment and how this process is ongoing and beneficial for both sides.
David Eagleman discusses the concept of neuroplasticity, which refers to the brain's ability to change in response to experience. He argues that this ability allows us to change our lives for the better by increasing our potential for growth and change. He also advises young people to stay adaptable and to never give up on their passions.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
David Eagleman discusses the beauty and mystery of the human brain and its ability to change based on experiences and stimuli. He also discusses the benefits of therapy for those with psychological issues. Finally, he mentions Cash App and BetterHelp, two sponsors of this podcast.

00:05:00
David Eagleman discusses the book "Live Wired," which lays out the theory that the brain is constantly rewiring itself to adapt to the environment. He discusses how the brain is physically changing and how difficult it is to create systems like this.

00:10:00
David Eagleman discusses the principle of plasticity, which refers to the ability of a system to mold into a new shape and then hold that shape. He argues that different parts of the brain have different plasticity windows, which determines how fast something hardens into place. He also discusses the idea that depending on how much data a person receives, their brain may be more or less malleable.

00:15:00
David Eagleman discusses how the human brain is malleable, but also has some built-in software that allows for memories to be more stable over time.

00:20:00
David Eagleman discusses the idea of neuroplasticity and how it affects our ability to learn and adapt to our surroundings. He also touches on the idea that some parts of the brain remain malleable throughout our lives, even as we get older.

00:25:00
David Eagleman discusses the idea of neuroplasticity and how it can be used to help people adapt to changing situations. He discusses how direct brain-machine interface (BCI) technology is still in its early stages, but has potential to be very helpful for surgeries and other medical procedures.

00:30:00
David Eagleman discusses the idea of neuroplasticity, which is the ability of the brain to change and learn, and how it applies to the field of robotics. He also talks about how the brain and technology are constantly adjusting to each other, and how this process is ongoing and beneficial for both sides.

00:35:00
David Eagleman talks about the potential for brain plasticity in the face of 2020's challenges. He says that while it will be a difficult year for many people, it is also an opportunity for creativity and growth. He believes that world-class researchers and professors should turn to Youtube to teach people, and thatNobel Prize-winning faculty should become Youtube stars.

00:40:00
This video discusses how the brain is able to form new knowledge based on the input it receives from the world. It discusses how children are growing up with more opportunities to learn and absorb information, which is leading to smarter children.

00:45:00
David Eagleman discusses how our experiences determine how our genes are expressed, and how this can impact our free will. He then speculates about how free will could be squeezed into the brain's mechanics, and concludes that it's still a mystery.

00:50:00
In the video, David Eagleman discusses neuroplasticity and the livewired brain. He points out that because we are live-wired, we are all about the world around us and are therefore susceptible to groupthink and the effects of positive or negative feedback. He argues that, because of this, it is difficult to say what makes someone evil, as it is difficult to differentiate between empathy and feeling physical pain due to another person's experience.

00:55:00
The video discusses how humans are wired to care more about their in-group (defined by a one-word label) than their outgroup. The study showed that this tendency is innate and has a strong effect on how people respond to pain. The video also discusses how there is hope for psychiatry, as it may be possible for someone else to help the livewired brain to adjust.

01:00:00
David Eagleman discusses the impact of neuroscience on psychiatry, and the need for specialized courts to better deal with mental health issues.

01:05:00
David Eagleman discusses the potential for neuroplasticity and the livewired brain, and how specialized court systems can be used to help people when their back is against the wall. He believes that the potential for machine learning is to be able to "rescue" humanity from its own limitations and that we are still learning how to communicate with each other.

01:10:00
David Eagleman discusses the idea that humans are smarter than fish because of the way our brains are wired, and how this relates to the field of artificial intelligence. He asserts that while computers currently cannot replicate the level of intelligence that humans possess, they are making progress in this area.

01:15:00
David Eagleman discusses the importance of neuroplasticity, or the ability of neurons to reconnect and learn new things. He argues that the desire to survive and be relevant is at the core of human cognition. He talks about how the fear of death is often suppressed and how most people don't see it as a threat. He suggests that meditation can help people understand this motivation more deeply.

01:20:00
David Eagleman discusses how the brain is "live wired" and how the ability to non-invasively feed data into the brain opens up new possibilities for understanding and manipulating consciousness.

01:25:00
David Eagleman discusses the concept of neuroplasticity, which refers to the ability of the brain to change in response to experience. He describes two examples of neuroplasticity - sensory expansion, which allows for the detection of infrared and ultraviolet radiation, and sensory addition, which allows for the detection of non-sensory information like changes in the electric field. He discusses the cost and availability of some of the devices necessary for neuroplasticity, and explains how a person's reality can be different depending on the peripheral devices they are equipped with.

01:30:00
David Eagleman discusses how neuroplasticity allows us to change our lives for the better by increasing our potential for growth and change. He also discusses how some of the things we choose to do have a greater impact on our lives than others, and how one day we will be exactly who we are meant to be.

01:35:00
David Eagleman talks about the "livewired brain" and how each individual's path in life is determined by the choices they make. He advises young people to stay adaptable and to never give up on their passions.

01:40:00
David Eagleman discusses the concept of neuroplasticity, which is the ability of the brain to change and adapt over time. He explains that understanding neuroplasticity would be a "numinous" experience, and that it is better than anything proposed in any holy text.
