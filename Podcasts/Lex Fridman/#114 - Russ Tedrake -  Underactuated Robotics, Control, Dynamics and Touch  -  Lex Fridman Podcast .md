George Lotter and Mike Tranifilo studied fish swimming in a water tunnel and found that if a fish is behind a rock, its gate changes and it starts swimming upstream. They also did an experiment where they tied a dead fish to a rock and watched it swim. The dead fish started swimming upstream due to its mechanics resonating with the vortex street. The video is worth watching for the clincher experiment where the dead fish starts swimming upstream even though it has no brain and no motors.
