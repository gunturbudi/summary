Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Douglas Lenat is the creator of Psych, a system that for close to 40 years and still today has sought to solve the core problem of artificial intelligence, the acquisition of common sense knowledge. Lenat discusses the mission of Psych and its various sub-goals. He argues that understanding something is more akin to having a "layered solid foundation of support" than simply having knowledge.

00:05:00
Douglas Lenat discusses the importance of common sense in AI and how to use knowledge to make quick, safe decisions in unpredictable situations. predicate calculus is a formal language used to represent information and is necessary for efficient AI computation.

00:10:00
Douglas Lenat discusses how many pieces of common sense knowledge an artificial intelligence must have in order not to be brittle, and how many assertions or rules a computer would have to write to represent it.

00:15:00
Douglas Lenat discusses the quest to solve common sense reasoning in AI with Lex Fridman. He explains that in order to achieve this, a massive amount of knowledge must be encoded into a rule-based system. This process took 38 years, but the end is near.

00:20:00
Douglas Lenat discusses the difficulty of making a knowledge-based system that is consistent, and discusses how this was overcome by learning to give up global consistency.

00:25:00
Douglas Lenat discusses the difficulty of building a globally consistent knowledge base in AI and the need to move to a system of local consistency. He uses the analogy of the surface of the earth being spherical but people living their lives as though it were flat, and discusses the difficulties of doing this in terms of representing knowledge. He goes on to talk about the need for context to be first class objects in a system, and how a graph is the best way to represent this.

00:30:00
Douglas Lenat discusses the Cyc project, which aimed to create a dewey decimal numbering system for all of its concepts, and the problems it faced. He also discusses Marvin Minsky's estimate for the number of facts required to capture basic common sense knowledge, and how assertions or rules can be used to represent them.

00:35:00
Douglas Lenat discusses how much knowledge is required for artificial intelligence to become "smart", and how much smarter humanity will be once general artificial intelligence exists.

00:40:00
Douglas Lenat discusses the pros and cons of the internet, discussing how it has made people globally ignorant and innumerate, and how it has reinforced juvenilism. He also touches on the dangers of the internet, pointing out that it has enabled the proliferation of bizarre conspiracy theories and fake news. He concludes by discussing how the internet has created an "echo chamber" in which people can be easily indoctrinated.

00:45:00
Douglas Lenat discusses the importance of automated reasoning, and how it can be used to help people learn and improve their critical thinking skills. He also discusses the importance of emotional intelligence in AI systems, and how they can help people connect with others and achieve happiness.

00:50:00
Douglas Lenat discusses the two directions that sitecore is pushing in regards to AI - one involving natural language understanding and the other involving knowledge editing and knowledge entry tools. Lex Fridman asks about specific techniques that Lenat finds inspiring, and Lenat responds that the machine learning work is more or less what our right brain hemisphere does.

00:55:00
Douglas Lenat discusses the implications of Cyc, a computer program that can solve common sense reasoning tasks. Lenat emphasizes the importance of synergy between human and machine intelligence, and explains how machine learning can be improved by incorporating aspects of psychology.

01:00:00
Douglas Lenat discusses the growth of psych and how it can be used to help automate knowledge acquisition. He also discusses how self-supervised learning methods can lead to errors, and how a large sphere of knowledge is achievable with enough effort.

01:05:00
In this video, Douglas Lenat discusses how knowledge-based systems like Cyc need to be able to reason about and explain their answers in more detail in order to be compelling and helpful. He also describes the semantic web and how it can represent complex expressions.

01:10:00
Douglas Lenat discusses the quest to solve common sense reasoning in AI, highlighting the need for more expressive data formats. He relates this quest to the history of the semantic web, which aimed to represent complex sentences in a more meaningful way.

01:15:00
Douglas Lenat discusses the need for computers to be able to understand complex, natural language concepts. He discusses how semantic web technologies aim to achieve this by allowing computers to reflect on their own processes of understanding.

01:20:00
Douglas Lenat discusses the benefits of using "psych" to help people learn more effectively.

01:25:00
Douglas Lenat discusses the role of the mentor in AI, the importance of using a metaphor to communicate ideas, and the joys and sadness of teaching artificial intelligence to machines.

01:30:00
Douglas Lenat discusses the quest to solve common sense reasoning in artificial intelligence, explaining that this is a difficult task that requires understanding human emotions and motivations. He goes on to say that one way that psych has attempted to accomplish this is by generating plausible scenarios that explore possible future outcomes.

01:35:00
Douglas Lenat discusses the complexities of love, stating that there are around 75 different concepts that can be grouped together under the term. He explains that language can be ambiguous, as humans are prone to misunderstanding one another.

01:40:00
Douglas Lenat discusses the importance of having a beautiful vision and achieving it, as well as the importance of working on challenging projects.

01:45:00
Douglas Lenat is the founder of Cyc, a computer program that can solve common sense reasoning problems. Lex Fridman interviews Lenat about Cyc and the quest to solve common sense reasoning in AI. Lenat says that until they are far enough along, other people can help with the final n percent of the project. He also mentions that he doesn't quit often, but there are times when he becomes depressed about the difficulty of the project.

01:50:00
Douglas Lenat discusses the importance of using a higher order logic, or expressive representation language, in AI research, and how it can be a more useful tool than simply using taxonomic relations between terms. He explains that this is not the only goal of open psych, as it is also important to convince researchers of the power of this type of representation language. Despite this, many AI researchers seem to be content with using only taxonomic relations, rather than the full psych system, which Lenat believes is a missed opportunity.

01:55:00
Douglas Lenat discusses the Cyc project, which is aimed at solving common sense reasoning in artificial intelligence. Lenat notes that this is a difficult task, as many aspects of AI are still proprietary. He also discusses the importance of open sourcing some components of Cyc in order to leverage the community and allow for rapid advances in the field.

02:00:00
Douglas Lenat discusses the epistemological problem of what the system should know, the heuristic problem of how to reason efficiently, and the meta-level advice that enables the system to reason about what knowledge is relevant and how to attack a problem.

02:05:00
Douglas Lenat discusses the difficulty of reasoning about complex problems in artificial intelligence, and how some of the work done by inference programmers is actually done in a more efficient dialect of Lisp. He also points out that the development of programs in Lisp precedes modern computer languages by thousands to fifty thousand times.

02:10:00
Douglas Lenat discusses Cyc, a software that can speed up inference in rule-based systems. He says that the language a programmer uses is not as important as the ability to think in terms of rule-based systems and how to efficiently use data structures.

02:15:00
The Knowledge Activitization Institute (KAI) is a not-for-profit organization founded by Douglas Lenat in order to identify talented individuals who can become skilled in ontological engineering, a field that deals with the conversion of messy human language and knowledge into formal logic. The institute offers scholarships to train these individuals and place them in companies that need their skills. If this is successful, it could create an enormous number of high-paying jobs for people who currently have no way out.

02:20:00
Douglas Lenat discusses the concept of "cyc," which refers to a computer system that is capable of understanding and reasoning about the world. He notes that, while a PhD does not make a person inherently less capable of introspection, it can reduce one's ability to focus on deep thinking tasks. He goes on to say that, in order to create truly intelligent AIs, tests of intelligence must involve depth of reasoning and a wide range of questioning. He also points out that, while young children are able to engage with AIs for a longer period of time than adult humans, they eventually become less interested in the conversation.

02:25:00
Douglas Lenat discusses the concept of "general intelligence" and how it can be measured. He says that the system must be able to exhibit many human-like abilities in order to be considered intelligent, including knowledge, reasoning, and emotions. He also says that a body or physical manifestation of consciousness is not required for general intelligence, but is instead a belief held by some people.

02:30:00
Douglas Lenat argues that humans are living in an illusion and that ai needs to understand death in order to be able to create intelligent machines.

02:35:00
Douglas Lenat, a computer scientist and AI advocate, discusses the challenges of ethical decision-making in autonomous vehicles. He argues that these vehicles will require a complex understanding of human behavior and psychology in order to effectively navigate the unpredictable risks posed by human drivers.

02:40:00
Douglas Lenat discusses the importance of two-part questions in AI - can the machine help identify what are the big problems in the world and what are some novel solutions to those problems that are not being talked about by anyone. He also mentions that a lot of AI is locked into the deep learning machine learning paradigm.

02:45:00
Douglas Lenat discusses the potential for artificial intelligence to solve common sense reasoning challenges and the importance of legacy. He encourages young people to pursue their dreams and make a difference in the world.

02:50:00
