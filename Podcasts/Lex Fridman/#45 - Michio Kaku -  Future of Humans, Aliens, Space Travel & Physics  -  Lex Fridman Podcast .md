# Summary of Michio Kaku: Future of Humans, Aliens, Space Travel & Physics | Lex Fridman Podcast #45

In this podcast, Michio Kaku discusses a variety of topics related to the future of humans, aliens, and space travel. He predicts that we will make contact with aliens within this century, and that they will likely be far more intelligent than we are. He also discusses the possibility of humans becoming immortal through the use of technology, and the importance of having a passion for science.
In this interview, Michio Kaku discusses his beliefs about the future of humans, aliens, space travel, and physics. He believes that there are other ways to solve problems than with traditional methods, such as using solar satellites to melt polar ice caps. This could lead to a more peaceful and inspiring future for humanity.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Michio Kaku discusses the possibility of contact with extraterrestrial life, ranking different civilizations according to their level of sophistication. He believes that we will make contact with aliens within this century, and that we will need to be able to understand their language in order to begin communication.

00:05:00
Michio Kaku discusses the possibility of there being multiple universes, each with its own timeline. He also discusses how the Big Bang might be just one instance of a larger, ongoing phenomenon.

00:10:00
Michio Kaku discusses the intersections between physics, religion, and ethics, and how they differ from the perspective of a squirrel or alien. He argues that while both science and religion have their purposes, science should remain focused on determining natural laws, while religion should focus on providing ethical guidance.

00:15:00
Michio Kaku discusses the possibility of aliens visiting Earth, and speculates on the likelihood that they would be friendly or hostile. He also discusses the origins of intelligence, and how three factors – eyesight, an opposable thumb, and language – are necessary for advanced cognition. He believes that extraterrestrial lifeforms would likely look radically different from us, and that they would likely be far more intelligent than we are.

00:20:00
Michio Kaku predicts that in the future, we will be able to send emotions and sensations through the Internet, which will change everything about human relationships.

00:25:00
Michio Kaku discusses the effects of technology on human relationships, citing the example of the internet. He explains that, while technology can be a double-edged sword, it has a moral direction, and predicts that, in the future, wars will be a distant memory.

00:30:00
Michio Kaku discusses the possibility of humans becoming immortal through the use of technology, including artificial intelligence, which will be able to locate and remove aging genes.

00:35:00
Michio Kaku discusses the future of humans and aliens, the possibility of space travel, and the impact of genetic errors on cells. He predicts that we will be able to cure many of the errors that build up in our cells, and that one day we may be able to live forever.

00:40:00
Michio Kaku discusses the importance of having a passion for science and the impact that junior high school has on scientists' careers. He also points out that one's sense of wonder at the universe never fades and that Einstein's theory of everything is a simplification of complex principles.

00:45:00
Professor Michio Kaku discusses the theory of string theory, which he believes is the only theory that has survived every challenge so far. He explains that the strings inspire a view of the universe as a computer, with each universe containing a finite amount of information.

00:50:00
Michio Kaku discusses the idea that the universe may not be a simulation, as calculations for such a feat would require infinite amounts of information. He also suggests that life could have arisen as a result of a chance event, and that humans may soon be able to explore Mars.

00:55:00
Michio Kaku discusses the potential for humans and aliens to explore space and the possibility of terraforming Mars in order to provide a permanent home for humanity. He also discusses the potential for type 1 civilizations, which would rely on fusion power for their sustenance.

01:00:00
Michio Kaku discusses the future of humans, aliens, space travel, and physics in this interview with Lex Fridman. He believes that there are other ways to solve problems than with traditional methods, such as using solar satellites to melt polar ice caps. This could lead to a more peaceful and inspiring future for humanity.
