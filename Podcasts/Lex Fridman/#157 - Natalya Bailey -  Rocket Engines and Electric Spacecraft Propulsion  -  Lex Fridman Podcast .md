Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Natalya Bailey is a rocket scientist and spacecraft propulsion engineer who has worked at MIT and now owns and runs Axion Systems, specializing in efficient space propulsion technology for satellites and spacecraft. She discusses her interest in space and extraterrestrial life, and shares her thoughts on the likelihood of intelligent life existing and whether aliens have communicated with us.

00:05:00
Natalya Bailey discusses the engineering possibilities that space exploration presents, and her excitement for the possibility of finding intelligent life on other planets. She notes that if we find life on Mars, it would confirm that it is more common for life to exist than previously thought.

00:10:00
Natalya Bailey discusses the potential for electric spacecraft propulsion and the challenges of human colonization of Mars. She believes that the private sector cannot financially support human exploration of other planets, but that ai could play a larger role in space exploration in the future.

00:15:00
Natalya Bailey discusses the principles behind rocket engines and electric spacecraft propulsion. She says that while the physics of each type of engine is well understood, one of the last gaps is understanding what products of combustion are produced.

00:20:00
In an ion propulsion engine, an ionization chamber is used to inject a propellant into the chamber and a stream of high-energy electrons is injected. The goal of the engine is to create one of these electrons-turning-into-ions and kick off a secondary electron, which then propels the spacecraft. In order to create the beam of ions, an external cathode must produce electron beams.

00:25:00
Natalya Bailey discusses how electric space propulsion works and how the technology has recently improved. She explains that the electric field is what pushes the ions out of the liquid, and that the cone is only created when the electric field is strong enough.

00:30:00
Natalya Bailey discusses the physics behind rocket engines, explaining that the engine is made up of tiny, sharp cones that are accelerated by an electric field. Recent advances in understanding the engine's boundaries and stable regimes have made it easier to design and operate.

00:35:00
Natalya Bailey discusses the physics of space propulsion and how axion propulsion may be the most captivating and beautiful idea in this field. She then discusses the potential for more powerful electric propulsion systems, and how they would be extremely fuel efficient but more instantaneous for us to do more interesting missions.

00:40:00
Natalya Bailey discusses the potential uses for electric propulsion in space, including for avoiding debris and lowering orbits to take higher resolution images.

00:45:00
Natalya Bailey discusses the need for propulsion in space and how it affects satellite design. She also discusses the different types of small satellites and how they are used.

00:50:00
Natalya Bailey discusses the potential for millions of satellites in orbit, and the psychological challenges that come with living in a space colony. She also predicts that a new revolution will redefine government, and that cryptocurrencies could be the basis of a new financial system.

00:55:00
Natalya Bailey discusses two forms of propulsion - chemical propulsion and electric space propulsion. She speculates on how these might one day enable us to travel faster than the speed of light. Bailey also discusses the Breakthrough Star Shot, a project looking to send small chip sets to nearby exoplanets to accelerate them to speeds close to the speed of light.

01:00:00
Natalya Bailey discusses her experience founding a space propulsion company, and how finding the right employees is essential for success. She also discusses her experience with special relativity and quantum tunneling.

01:05:00
Natalya Bailey discusses the importance of a strong network, the importance of being unconventional in order to compete in the space industry, and the importance of cutting costs.

01:10:00
Natalya Bailey shares her insights on SpaceX and NASA's successful commercial spaceflight endeavors, and how this represents a new era of space exploration. She also provides advice on how to start and run a successful company.

01:15:00
Natalya Bailey discusses her experience starting a new company and her advice for aspiring entrepreneurs. She emphasizes the importance of having a clear vision, staying grounded in fundamentals, and being aware of the culture of the company.

01:20:00
Natalya Bailey discusses her love of books and how they have helped her in her career as a rocket engineer and electric spacecraft propulsion designer. She recommends three books that have had an impact on her life. Fitzgerald's 10 is one of them.

01:25:00
Natalya Bailey discusses her love of reading fiction and how it has helped her develop empathy for others. She also discusses her thoughts on the meaning of life and whether or not humans are meant to be in space.

01:30:00
Natalya Bailey is a space engineer and discusses the different aspects of space exploration, including spacecraft propulsion. She believes that the goal of space exploration is not the meaning of existence, but the generation of knowledge and the pursuit of human betterment. She believes that the 20th and 21st centuries will be remembered for space exploration, and that all civilizations that pursue space exploration will either become space-faring or extinct.
