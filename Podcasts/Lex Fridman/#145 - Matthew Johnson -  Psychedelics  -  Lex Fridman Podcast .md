Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Psychedelics, including classic psychedelics like psilocybin and salosine, work by altering serotonin receptors in the brain. Other compounds, like pcp, ketamine, and MDMA, have different effects on the brain. Psychedelics are interesting to Professor Matthew Johnson because they offer hints about the nature of experience and the role of chemicals in the brain.

00:05:00
The psychedelics LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline all act on the post-synaptic receptor side of the synapse, flooding the synapse with serotonin. They have very strong effects on one sense of reality and one sense of self, and are extremely safe at the physiological level.

00:10:00
Psychedelics, such as MDMA, LSD, and psilocybin, differ from exercise in that they offer more intense and prolonged mind-body experiences. While psychedelics are not addictive, they are more dangerous to use than traditional drugs of abuse. MDMA is currently being studied for its therapeutic benefits for PTSD.

00:15:00
MDMA has a range of subjective effects, some of which are similar to those experienced with classic psychedelics, but it also has its own unique properties. While it is possible to measure the effects of MDMA, it is ultimately up to the individual to determine what they experienced during their session.

00:20:00
Matthew Johnson discusses the potential effects of psychedelics on psychological, emotional, and spiritual levels. He believes that the language used to describe the experience can affect the journey.

00:25:00
Matthew Johnson talks about the potential of psychedelics, citing examples of how psychedelics have helped people in various fields. He argues that there is potential for psychedelics to help shift our understanding of reality, and that more research is needed in this area.

00:30:00
Matthew Johnson discusses the potential benefits of psychedelics, particularly in the context of problem-solving. He believes that more rigorous studies are needed in order to fully understand the potential benefits and risks of these drugs.

00:35:00
The video discusses the potential benefits and therapeutic potential of psychedelics, including LSD. It also discusses the effects of high doses of these substances.

00:40:00
Matthew Johnson discusses psychedelics, and how they can open people up to different realities. He also mentions the idea that certain stories and archetypes might be present in our minds, and that these might be the only way for the nervous system to orient towards these realms.

00:45:00
In this YouTube video, "Matthew Johnson: Psychedelics," Matthew Johnson discusses the differences between psychedelics, such as LSD and psilocybin, and "dmt," which is a more recent entheogen. He also talks about the role that psychedelics play in his personal life and how they've helped him to break out of negative patterns of thinking.

00:50:00
Behavioral economics is the application of microeconomic principles to non-economic behavior, and addiction is a complex issue that can be understood from a variety of perspectives.

00:55:00
Matthew Johnson discusses demand curves and how they can be used to study addiction. He also discusses how different levels of price can affect demand for a particular good.

01:00:00
The video discusses the concept of delayed discounting, which is the tendency for people to discount rewards (e.g., money, food) in proportion to their distance from the reward. This phenomenon is seen in humans and many other species of animals, and is thought to be responsible for addiction.

01:05:00
The video discusses the idea of addiction and how it affects the behavior of those addicted. It also discusses the idea of elasticity of pricing, and how it affects the economics of those selling illegal drugs.

01:10:00
In this video, Matthew Johnson discusses the effects of drugs on human behavior and how pricing is one of the many factors that affects consumption. He also mentions libertarian candidates for president who have a thought experiment of legalizing all drugs. His intuition tells him that a world where all drugs are legal is a safer world, but this depends on what we mean by legalization.

01:15:00
Matthew Johnson discusses the potential benefits and drawbacks of legalizing drugs. He argues that it would be a good thing if we regulated all drugs in a way that makes sense, citing examples such as safe injection sites for hard drugs. He also touches on the issue of regulation and how it varies depending on the drug.

01:20:00
Matthew Johnson argues that psychedelics, like opioids, can have a huge impact on reducing rates of opioid addiction and death, but they should be done in a way that sends the right message. He also testified in favor of legalizing psychedelics in New Jersey.

01:25:00
In this YouTube video, Matthew Johnson discusses the addictive potential of some drugs, specifically tobacco and cocaine. He also warns of the dangers of prohibition, which has not historically worked. He suggests that nicotine should be taxed and regulated, and that e-cigarettes could be a safer, more effective alternative to traditional cigarettes.

01:35:00
The video discusses the research that has been done on the effects of various substances on decision-making, specifically focusing on how alcohol and psychedelics affect sexual decisions. It seems that, in some cases, alcohol can lead to more risky sexual decisions, while psychedelics do not seem to have this effect.

Matthew Johnson discusses the work he's done with psychedelics, specifically psilocybin, in helping people quit smoking. He notes that the majority of his work is based on research, with only a small number of people using the drug "in the context of mushrooms." He goes on to say that the high dose used in research is equivalent to a "real deal dose" of psilocybin, and that this is not something that would be taken by "people that hang out with their friends going to the concert again."

01:55:00
The study of 15 people who took 30 milligrams of psilocybin found that it had a mild effect on serotonin 2a receptors. The participants were recruited based on their interest in psychedelics, not necessarily because they were going to take the drug. The therapy involves a lot of non-psilocybin sessions to prepare the participant.

02:00:00
In this video, Matthew Johnson discusses the effects of psychedelics on both the intellectual and emotional levels. He notes that while psychedelics can be scary at first, the experience can be safe and therapeutic if the user trusts the context and guides present.

02:05:00
Psychedelics, such as mushrooms, can be a fun and recreational experience, but can be harder to enjoy when taken in a social setting. People often feel a sense of bravery and courage while using psychedelics, and describe the experience as being "heavy lifting" and "exhausting." Some people report that the experience is more profound than others, and that it varies widely from person to person.

02:10:00
The video discusses the different levels at which psychedelic experiences can be experienced, including the Jungian, perceptual, and psychodynamic levels. The last level, the mystical integral level, is described as the "most remarkable" experience. The study found that psilocybin had a modest impact on addiction, with some participants reporting a reduced desire to use tobacco.

02:15:00
The video discusses the positive results of a pilot study of psilocybin for smoking cessation, and the preparations for a larger, randomized study. The study is ongoing, and success rates are high for those who have completed the one-year follow-up.

02:20:00
Matthew Johnson discusses his experience with psychedelics and shares advice on how to find studies and mentorships in the field.

02:25:00
Matthew Johnson discusses the effects of psychedelics on the human mind, saying that they have taught him about the magnitude of depth and complexity of human experience. He also discusses the scientific evidence for the relationship between biology and experience, saying that all our experience is a simulation.

02:30:00
Matthew Johnson discusses the possible future of psychedelic drugs, discussing their potential to alter neurological function in ways that may have far-reaching implications.

02:35:00
In this YouTube video, Matthew Johnson discusses psychedelics and their potential for unlocking incredible new insights into the brain. He notes that while there are serious ethical considerations to be taken into account, such as the risk of addiction and abuse, he is nonetheless supportive of psychedelics and their potential for treating serious neurological disorders.

02:40:00
Matthew Johnson discusses the potential for psychedelics to help with various aspects of technology, including AI and neurolink. He argues that the current academic environment is biased and that progress is inevitable. He urges people to be empirically driven and not be swayed by prejudice.

02:45:00
The video discusses Matthew Johnson's paper "Consciousness Religion and Gurus: Pitfalls of psychedelic medicine." Johnson argues that the terms "consciousness," "religion," and "guru" can be used in a variety of ways and can be confusing, but in a specific way they can be used to describe phenomena that are related to the heart of the hard problem of consciousness. He mentions that psychedelics have not really taught us anything about the nature of consciousness, but he is hopeful that they will. This story is being challenged by drugs that decouple the default mode network, which is associated with self-referential processing.

02:50:00
Matthew Johnson discusses the potential implications of psychedelics affecting the default mode network, which is known to be related to self-referential processing and a sense of self. He argues that the idea of self is not as simple as it seems, and that consciousness and intelligence may not be as straightforward as we think.

02:55:00
In this video, Matthew Johnson discusses the difference between philosophy and engineering, and how the mind might be a radio that tunes into another medium where consciousness actually exists. He also discusses the so-called psi phenomena, and how he is attracted to ideas of panpsychism.

03:00:00
Matthew Johnson discusses the idea of panpsychism, which is the idea that consciousness is fundamental and pervades all matter. He speculates that what is fundamental might be space-time itself, and that it is difficult to test whether or not this is true because we don't have the science to do so. He concludes by saying that although both computational complexity and emergence of phenomenal consciousness are possible, he leans towards panpsychism because it makes more sense to him.

03:05:00
Matthew Johnson discusses psychedelics and their potential for expanding our understanding of complexity in the universe. He also discusses the possibility of extraterrestrial life forms, and how they might look different from what we can imagine.

03:10:00
Matthew Johnson discusses the possibility of alien life forms and discusses the research of a psychedelic researcher who labeled this speculation. He also discusses the importance of being empirically grounded and skeptical, and how being closed to speculation can often lead to poor engineering decisions.

03:15:00
Matthew Johnson discusses his views on death and mortality, and how his view has changed as a result of his research into psychedelics.

03:20:00
Matthew Johnson discusses the existential terror of death and how psychedelics can help to address this. He argues that if we are successful in proliferating throughout the observable universe, we will not be there to experience it.

03:25:00
Matthew Johnson discusses the meaning of life and why psychedelics may play a role in discovering this meaning. He also discusses his work with cancer patients and how psychedelics helped them.

03:30:00
