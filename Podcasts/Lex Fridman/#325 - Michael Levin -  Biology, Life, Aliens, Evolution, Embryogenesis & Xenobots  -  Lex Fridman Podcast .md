Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Michael Levin discusses the process of embryogenesis, which demonstrates the gradual transformation of physics into cognition. He also discusses the relationship between DNA, geometry, and the laws of physics, and the importance of understanding this continuum.

00:05:00
Michael Levin discusses the process of embryogenesis, which reveals the laws of physics and biology. He argues that this process is not just reliable, but also allows for the creation of complex and innovative creatures.

00:10:00
In this video, Michael Levin discusses biology, life, aliens, evolution, and the possibility of zenobots. He emphasizes the need to understand the innate capacities of organisms before attempting to engineer or program them, and goes on to argue that advances in regenerative medicine require us to take advantage of this.

00:15:00
The presenter discusses the idea that biology uses top-down controls, and how this is difficult to reverse. They go on to discuss how the salamander arm is rebuilt in a way that is reminiscent of cognitive abilities like memory and thinking.

00:20:00
Michael Levin discusses the idea that cognition can be embodied, and describes two examples of this - as a small child and as an unfertilized cell. He argues that, although cognition does not necessarily disappear when one becomes less biological, it is still a matter of growing past that point.

00:25:00
Michael Levin discusses the idea of "many selves" and how evolution produces problem-solving machines. He also discusses the origins of the brain, which he says is a late development.

00:30:00
In this video, Michael Levin discusses the concept of autopoiesis, which is the ability of cells to create and sustain themselves. He also discusses how evolution shapes the cells' abilities to create and survive, and how engineering terms, such as competency, can be used to quantify and understand these concepts.

00:35:00
In this video, Michael Levin discusses biology, life, aliens, evolution, embryogenesis, and xenobots. He explains that biology is not like a machine where each level has an agenda, and the final outcome is the result of cooperation and competition between levels. For example, during embryogenesis, tissues and organs are competing with each other, and it is an important part of development. He also points out that while all organisms have goals, these goals are usually relative to the welfare of the individual parts, and evolution can take a long time due to the competition between levels.

00:40:00
Michael Levin discusses the concept of autopoiesis, or the self-construction of systems. He explains how this concept is similar to the idea of free will, and how it is at the root of models of agency and control.

00:45:00
Michael Levin discusses the implications of free will and how it drives our view of ourselves and the outside world. He argues that even primitive organisms possess a sense of agency, and that Evolution has not given us high-resolution signals for sexual selection because these signals are easily hijacked. He suggests that the most adaptive system is one with top-down control, which is difficult to achieve and prone to cheating by parasites and cheaters.

00:50:00
Michael Levin discusses the bioelectricity of cells and how it can be used to signal and remember. He points to early pioneers of bioelectricity research, and discusses how bioelectricity has been used to understand physiology and development. Levin finishes by emphasizing the importance of bioelectricity in our understanding of cognition.

00:55:00
Michael Levin discusses the role of Gap Junctions in cellular communication and how they pave the way for higher level cognition.

01:00:00
Michael Levin discusses the biology behind memory storage and how it can be used to understand and design more efficient computer systems. He also talks about a new idea called software 2.0, which uses artificial neural networks to program computers at a higher level.

01:05:00
Michael Levin discusses the idea that the best locus of control is not always at the lowest level, and how this applies to biology and life in general. He discusses how somatic cells form electrical networks during embryogenesis, and how these networks are used to process information about the current shape and the goal shape. He also discusses the idea that planaria can be seen as an example of a life form that has lasted for 400 million years and has not aged.

01:10:00
The video discusses the magical planaria, which are able to regenerate every part of their body and don't get cancer. It also discusses how a somatic electrical network in these creatures remembers the correct pattern and builds a new brain. The video then shows how a false memory created with drugs can cause a two-headed worm to form. Finally, it demonstrates how the hardware software distinction is important in understanding the origins of body plants.

01:15:00
In this video, Michael Levin discusses how mutations happen and how this process is responsible for the amazing regenerative abilities of planaria. He also discusses how our genomes determine our body structures and how the effort put into our algorithms affects our ability to produce offspring with great fitness. Finally, he talks about xenobots and how they are different from biological robots.

01:20:00
In the video, Michael Levin discusses the concept of xenobots, or biological robots that are built from cells that are not from the original organism. He argues that this technology has the potential to be very powerful, and that the understanding of developmental biology is essential to making these xenobots successful.

01:25:00
Michael Levin discusses how biology does not take the past too seriously, and how this is evident in experiments such as the old one involving salamanders. He goes on to talk about how intelligence is not just about being able to get to the same goal by different means, but also about having a stable baseline mode. Finally, he discusses how evolution is good at creating hardware that is stable and capable of performing the same task, even in cases where assumptions do not hold.

01:30:00
Michael Levin discusses the importance of the brain and how it is special in comparison to other body parts. He talks about how other things don't get enough credit and how the brain is an incredible and special thing. He also discusses how we should be creating Xenobots and other strange creatures until we find actual aliens.

01:35:00
Michael Levin discusses the concept of intelligence, noting that it is not limited to carbon-based lifeforms. He argues that intelligence can be found in every living organism, including plants, and that artificial intelligence is not a new phenomena.

01:40:00
Lego robots are a lot more fun when one can't understand why they are doing certain things, and one can experience the surprise and beauty of these robots through the use of abstraction. Biology does this for us by hiding the details of the complex process behind layers of abstraction. Unconventional cognition is simply everything outside of what we typically consider as cognition.

01:45:00
Michael Levin discusses how communication with complex systems, such as cells and xenobots, can be difficult. He suggests training them to act in a certain way in order to create a stronger connection.

01:50:00
Michael Levin discusses his theory that aliens are half-sentient, and discusses the research necessary to prove or disprove this theory. He also discusses the poetry and uncertainty involved in understanding consciousness.

01:55:00
Michael Levin argues that consciousness is different from other scientific theories in that it is not based on observable behaviors, but rather on subjective experiences. He argues that if a theory of consciousness is correct, it would make predictions in a poetic or artistic format.

02:00:00
Michael Levin discusses the challenge of understanding other Minds and the implications of this for human civilization. He discusses the problem of competing groups of intelligent beings, and points out that, before worrying about such issues, we need to ask ourselves why we are behaving the way we are.

02:05:00
Michael Levin discusses how the decision-making calculus of a single cell defines the entirety of an organism, and how this process of evolution is inevitable. He also talks about how some people believe that Evolution is rewinding the tape of life, while others believe that it is very sensitive to Frozen Accidents.

02:10:00
Michael Levin discusses the idea that evolution optimizes for biomass, not for intelligence or fairness, and discusses some examples of synthetic organisms that he hopes to create. He believes that if we can achieve a better understanding of the embodied intelligence of organs and tissues, we could achieve a radically different regenerative medicine.

02:15:00
Michael Levin, a biologist and futurist, talks about the potential of synthetic biology and xenobots, and how they could be used to improve human health and the environment. He also discusses the challenges of creating ethical norms that are not based on contingent facts of human history.

02:20:00
Michael Levin discusses the various ways in which regenerative medicine can be useful for treating various diseases, including cancer. He also discusses the work that his team is doing to develop a method for regenerating limbs.

02:25:00
In this video, Michael Levin discusses the goals of tiny little selves in the context of cancer development. He also discusses the relationship between viruses and cells, and how both are transformed by experience.

02:30:00
Michael Levin discusses the commonalities between cognitive agents, and how Competency to pursue a goal is a common attribute. He presents a model of a cognitive light cone, which represents the largest system a cognitive agent can work towards.

02:35:00
Michael Levin discusses the difference between critique and meta-advice, and how to distinguish between the two. He recommends that young people avoid giving advice that they may not be able to back up, and to focus on honing their own skills rather than following the advice of others.

02:40:00
Michael Levin discusses the role of death in life and how it promotes change and turnover. He also discusses apoptosis, a process by which cells die.

02:45:00
The video discusses how humans have evolved to have a longer-term perspective, and how this may be a key factor in the development of psychosis. It also discusses the concept of population selection, and how suicide may be a way for organisms to determine that themselves they are not fit for the environment.

02:50:00
Michael Levin discusses his existential concerns about the end of life and the possibility of consciousness in organic beings. He argues that the experience of life is what matters, and that the back story of scientific explanations does not change the fundamental experience of being alive.

02:55:00
Michael Levin discusses how biology, life, evolution, and aliens are all connected. He discusses how science doesn't currently understand everything, but that Consciousness is an important topic that needs to be explored further.

03:00:00
