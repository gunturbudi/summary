In this YouTube video, Sequence to Sequence Deep Learning (Quoc Le, Google), the creator discusses the basics of this deep learning technique, and provides an example of how it might be applied to a specific problem. They then go on to explain how to tokenize an email and normalize it, before training a model on the data. Finally, they explain how to convert the model's predictions into a yes or no answer.

The video discusses the basics of deep learning, including how to sequence a sequence of inputs. The author notes that there is some information loss in the representation of the inputs, and introduces the recurrent network, a type of deep learning network that preserves information ordering. The recurrent network is used to make predictions on new inputs.
