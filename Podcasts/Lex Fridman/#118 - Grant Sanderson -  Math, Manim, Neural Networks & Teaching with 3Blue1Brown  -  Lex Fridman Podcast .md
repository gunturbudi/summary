Grant Sanderson is the creator of the popular Three Blue One Brown YouTube channel, where he educates and inspires the world with the beauty and power of mathematics. In this episode, Grant discusses how pandemic challenges have forced millions of educators to rethink how they teach. He also discusses how his dream is to see more and more of his colleagues at MIT and world experts across the world summon their inner Three Blue One Brown and create canonical explainer videos on a topic they know more than almost anyone else in the world. Finally, sponsors Dollar Shave Club and Doordash are announced, and the show concludes with a quick shout-out to Lex Friedman's other projects, including his podcast and website.

Grant Sanderson discusses Richard Feynman and his impact on him. He discusses how Feynman was not just a great physicist, but a great thinker who was constantly reinvigorating himself and pushing himself to new limits. Sanderson recommends aspiring to be like Feynman, who was constantly rediscovering and reinventing his theories.

00:10:00
Grant Sanderson discusses the importance of relationships with professors and the benefits of deep understanding of a wide variety of topics. He also discusses his approach to teaching and the potential risks of relying too heavily on the Feynman effect.

00:15:00
Grant Sanderson discusses the value of interactive elements in video lectures, how they can help students learn, and how teachers can use them to help students understand concepts.

00:20:00
Grant Sanderson discusses how topology can be used to explore different ideas in mathematics, from epidemiology to game theory. He touches on the Sir model, which is an abstract model of growth.

00:25:00
In this video, Grant Sanderson discusses the mathematical principle of exponential growth and how it can be applied to epidemiology. He also provides lessons that can be learned from the study of exponential growth in other areas of science.

00:30:00
Grant Sanderson discusses how exponential growth occurs, and how understanding the mechanism behind it can help us better anticipate and manage it. He cites examples of exponential growth in technology and Moore's Law, which show how knowledge and technology can continue to improve rapidly.

00:35:00
Grant Sanderson discusses how the exponential growth of technology is a fundamental law of the universe. He argues that this law is exemplified by the increase in human intelligence and potential over time.

00:40:00
Grant Sanderson talks about the challenges and opportunities of space exploration, and how they inspire him to continue working hard. He also talks about the importance of innovation and how it is necessary for many future space exploration endeavors.

00:45:00
Grant Sanderson explains how the context of national security can help spur innovation, specifically in the field of computer science. He also mentions the work of Bell Labs and the Manhattan Project as examples of how innovation can come from a combination of theory and practical application.

00:50:00
Grant Sanderson discusses his experience as a mathematician, his work on artificial intelligence, and his thoughts on the current pandemic. He talks about the importance of chance collisions and how they can be difficult to find in the current work environment. He also discusses the importance of solitude and how it can be beneficial to writers and other professionals.

00:55:00
Grant Sanderson talks about how he tries to be productive in different ways, from having a "perfect" schedule that changes from day-to-day to having a "nice cycle" of reading something different and going back to writing. He says that if he ever changes his ways, Benjamin Franklin may have had a more systematic approach to being productive.

01:00:00
Grant Sanderson discusses the phenomenon of wanting to escape from reality, but not really wanting to escape from reality. He also discusses the addiction of social media checking and how it affects his happiness. He recommends that content creators learn to judge the quality of their work by the comments, not by the number of viewers.

01:05:00
Grant Sanderson discusses the difficulty of creating quality content, considering the feedback of a small number of people versus a large number of people. He relates this to his difficulties with following up on promises he has made. Joe Rogan is an inspiration to him for how he handles criticism and interacting with fans offline.

01:10:00
Grant Sanderson discusses the advantages of teaching using live streaming and texting, and how it can be an effective way to teach remotely. He also discusses the importance of having accessible explanations for math concepts, and how to make this a common practice.

01:15:00
Grant Sanderson discusses how self-criticism andanalysis can lead to improvement, how to make audio sound good, and his thoughts onlive lectures.

01:20:00
In this YouTube video, Grant Sanderson talks about how teachers can create shorter, well-planned videos that still explain complex concepts in an easy to understand way. He also mentions that there is appeal to explaining something beautiful, technically, and without resorting to marketing.

01:25:00
Grant Sanderson discusses the fear of embarrassment that can keep people from posting their work online, and how it affects the quality of educational content on YouTube. He also points out how the pandemic will force people to become more engaged in their work, and how podcasting should be free and not constrained to a platform.

01:30:00
In this video, Grant Sanderson discusses math, manim, neural networks, and teaching. He says that YouTube is "forever" and it won't be replaced by Alphabet or Google in the future. He says that some of the beautiful things about neural networks and machine learning are the layered structure and how they can generalize across abstraction levels.

01:35:00
Grant Sanderson discusses the value of creating low-information descriptions of complex systems, and how code synthesis can help achieve this. He also discusses the recent release of the openai gbt3 model, which is designed to learn how to communicate with humans.

01:40:00
Grant Sanderson discusses how his artificial intelligence program, GPT3, is able to recognize patterns in data that are similar to what humans are able to do. He also points out that while math is a field that relies heavily on pattern recognition, GPT3 is not perfect at this task.

01:45:00
Grant Sanderson discusses the use of mathematical models, specifically language models, for teaching and explaining concepts. He also discusses the importance of properly integrating these models with the community.

01:50:00
In this video, Grant Sanderson shares his thoughts on thewalrus operator, which is a new operator in Python 3.8 that he findss psychologically interesting. He also discusses the value of great leadership and how it can be seen in open source communities.

01:55:00
Grant Sanderson discusses the mathematics involved in theories of everything, and how accessible these theories are to nonspecialists. He also discusses two of the more popular theories of everything, those of Stephen Wolfram and Eric Weinstein.

02:00:00
Grant Sanderson discusses math, manim, neural networks, and teaching. He believes that most problems are too hard to solve for the average person, and that people should focus their efforts on solving problems that they can see resolved. Sanderson also believes that the meaning of life is something that is assigned by humans, and that most things do not have a meaning.

02:05:00
Grant Sanderson speaks about the meaning of life and how he does not understand what people are asking when they ask "why does life exist?" He goes on to say that people are asking similar questions, but also asking why the thing that gives them joy in their education and relationships is what they are talking about. He talks about how art and science can both be appreciated for their beauty, and how they open up new questions that science can only add to the excitement and mystery of life.
