He also discusses how exit is the anti-genocide technology because it is the route of the politically powerless.

01:20:00
In this video, Balaji Srinivasan discusses how microeconomic leverage and individual empowerment increase when the internet is available. He also talks about how the internet has increased voice and exit in every aspect of life.

01:25:00
Balaji Srinivasan discusses how the digital world has opened up new opportunities for increased mobility and exploration, but also how this increased mobility can lead to increased cruelty and derision. He believes that the internet will eventually find technological solutions to the increased cruelty, but warns that young people are currently more willing to engage in this type of behavior online.

01:30:00

Balaji Srinivasan discusses how to fix government, Twitter, science, and the FDA. He highlights Bedford's law, which states that the leading digits in a collection of data sets are usually small, and the first digit law, which states that passion is inversely proportional to the amount of real information available. He also discusses how Google's Model A, which allowed for different versions of a Wikipedia page to be edited and reviewed, has been replaced by Wikipedia's current system, which rewards dog and persistence over editorial privilege.

02:25:00
Balaji Srinivasan discusses how bias can be built into platforms, such as Twitter, the FDA, and Wikipedia, and how it affects the accuracy of information. He also discusses how reliable sources can help to mitigate this bias.

02:30:00

He discusses how to identify when a source of information is biased and why cynicism towards institutions is detrimental.

02:40:00
Balaji Srinivasan, a venture capitalist and investor, discusses how to fix government, Twitter, science, and the FDA. He argues that if we cannot trust anything, then anarchy and chaos reign.

He suggests that sharing the code and data for experiments, as well as having a culture that says it is not okay to fail, are important steps in fixing these institutions. He argues that academia is not innovative, and that this is due to the prevalence of prestigious, rather than independent, citations. This, in turn, creates a dynamic in which the age of researchers continues to increase, leading to more democratic, high-bound systems.

05:55:00
The five examples of left-leaning journalists mentioned in the transcript are John Reed, Mao, Durante, Herbert Matthews, and David Halberstam. Reed brought Lennon's message to the world in a different medium than Lennon would have, Stalin starved out the Ukrainians, Edgar Snow was Mao's biographer, Herbert Matthews was like Castro, and David Halberstam was the source of many fabricated stories that led to the undermining of the South Vietnamese regime. Ashley Rinsberg wrote an in-depth account of these journalists in the book, "Great Lady Wink."

06:25:00
Balaji Srinivasan discusses how to fix government, Twitter, science, and the FDA. He argues that it might take years or decades for these reshuffles to play out, and that the eventual outcome will be the Republicans becoming the Bitcoin maximalists due to the Democrats' influence on culture.

06:30:00
In his book "The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism", Balaji Srinivasan argues that the three main problems facing society today- government, Twitter, and science- can all be fixed by a shift in vote capital. He points to 2013 as the year when these problems reached their most extreme levels, and argues that the rise of wokeess- a combination of focality and deconstruction- is to blame.

06:35:00
In this video, Balaji Srinivasan discusses how the words chosen by people in positions of power can be used to delegitimize their targets. He goes on to say that the next shift is already on, and that the establishment is coming back to the center.

06:40:00
Author Balaji Srinivasan discusses how government, Twitter, science, and the FDA can be fixed. He also compares the current cryptocurrency landscape to Microsoft in the 1990s. He believes that if the establishment has more power over fewer people, people can exit the cryptocurrency space.

06:45:00
