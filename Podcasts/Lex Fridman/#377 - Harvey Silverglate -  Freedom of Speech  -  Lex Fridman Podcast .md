# Summary of Harvey Silverglate: Freedom of Speech | Lex Fridman Podcast #377

Harvey Silverglate, a civil liberties attorney, argues in the Lex Fridman Podcast that censorship should not be imposed on hate speech in schools as it is as important as love speech, and without free speech, the decision-making process becomes poorer, less robust, and less successful. Silverglate believes in freedom of speech absolutism, with exceptions only for direct threats and defamation. He criticizes universities that enforce speech codes and believes universities should prepare students for life beyond graduation instead of protecting them from insult. Silverglate is running for a seat on the Harvard Board of Overseers to protect academic freedom and free speech and reduce tuition costs while firing 95% of administrators. He believes improving primary and secondary education is the solution to the inequality of opportunity that affirmative action aims to solve, opposes unions for public employees, and encourages more transparency from universities to protect freedom of speech.
Harvey Silverglate discusses a range of topics, including the ethics of university donors, the importance of academic freedom, the role of speech in society, and his perspective on controversial figures such as Alan Dershowitz and Donald Trump. He expresses concern about the abuse of power in universities and advocates for improving the education system to increase opportunities for disadvantaged people. Silverglate also offers insights into the workings of the FBI and argues that the agency should be abolished due to its systematic corruption. He concludes the interview with reflections on his life and the importance of promoting freedom of speech in American culture.

In this section of the video, Harvey Silverglate explains his belief in the absolute importance of freedom of speech, which he believes is the most crucial right for Americans. He argues that without it, no democracy can survive for long, and that hate speech is actually more valuable than love speech because it allows him to know who he should not turn his back on. He also discusses the role of his organization, FIRE, which focuses on free speech issues in academia but has recently expanded to address the censorship prevalent in society as a whole.

00:05:00
In this section of the podcast, Harvey Silverglate discusses the importance of freedom of speech and why hate speech should not be banned, even in schools. He believes that hate speech is as important as love speech, and that exposing oneself to emotional pain or discomfort is the price we pay for living in a free society. Silverglate argues that censoring speech leads to a censorship of thought, and that without free speech, decision-making processes become poorer, less robust, and ultimately less successful. He believes in Free Speech absolutism and thinks that hate speech does not lead to physical harm or violence, and that we have developed a culture where we talk back instead of resorting to physical violence.

00:10:00
In this section, Harvey Silverglate discusses the challenges posed by the internet to free speech absolutism, stating that he has no different rules for freedom of speech on the internet than in newspapers or lectures. He argues that even on the internet, free speech absolutism should rule, with exception to direct threats and defamation. While the internet has allowed speech to become viral and spread quickly to large audiences, with the potential for cyberbullying and attacks on ideas, Silverglate believes that this is a small price to pay for living in a free society, and that as long as nobody is going to die, the insult people feel is negligible.

00:15:00
In this section, Harvey Silverglate discusses the importance of freedom of speech on college campuses and how censorship can be destructive to the educational enterprise. He argues that education comes from the clash of ideas, and if certain points of view are not allowed to be expressed, students do not receive a good education. Furthermore, he applies the scientific method to non-science subjects such as history and journalism and believes that every point of view should be thrown into the marketplace, including ideas that may lead to an increase in hate. Harvey emphasizes that the First Amendment prohibits speech that is liable to produce imminent violence, such as yelling falsely fire in a crowded movie theater.

00:20:00
In this section, Harvey Silverglate discusses the exceptions to the First Amendment that the Supreme Court has defined and how he disagrees with the defamation exception. He believes that individuals can defend themselves against defamation with more speech and authentic communication. Silverglate emphasizes the importance of freedom of speech and freedom of reach, allowing consumers of speech to have the right to select what they read or listen to. He explains that the theory of academic freedom should be to entertain all kinds of ideas, even the most hateful or threatening ones, and universities should not have speech codes to enforce specific ways of thinking.

00:25:00
In this section, Harvey Silverglate expresses his belief that the overwhelming number of administrators in American higher education is detrimental to both academic freedom and tuition costs. He explains that many administrators are more concerned with controlling speech and behavior than with fostering academic growth, leading to a violation of freedom of speech. Silverglate argues that universities should focus on preparing students for life beyond graduation and that knowing who doesn't like you and being insulted are essential experiences for all students. He makes the case that the university's job is to protect students from physical assault but not from insult, and that it is crucial to know who dislikes you to develop a deeper understanding of human nature. He believes that most insulters are less intelligent than the people they insult and that firing 95% of administrators would have a positive impact on academic freedom and tuition costs.

00:30:00
In this section, Harvey Silverglate discusses the importance of academic freedom and free speech in the educational system. He mentions that universities are the ideal place for students to explore and learn in every way possible. However, he believes that the educational system has lost this sense of academic freedom and free speech, which needs to be taken more seriously. Silverglate is running for the Harvard Board of Overseers, and he hopes to change the current situation by protecting free speech and academic freedom in the university. He also expresses his concerns about the appointment of Claudine Gay as the new president of Harvard and how her record does not suggest respect for academic freedom and free speech.

00:35:00
In this section, civil liberties attorney Harvey Silverglate discusses his experience running for a seat on the Harvard Board of Overseers and the University's suppression of candidates through the Harvard Alumni Association. Silverglate explains how he was excluded from the officially nominated candidates' list and not allowed to broadcast his views to voters, which he sees as a form of candidate suppression. He believes that Harvard needs to get back to valuing free speech and reducing tuition costs while eliminating 95% of the administrators, as it would have a significant impact on the entire country if it became the most affordable college in the United States. Despite the challenges, Silverglate is confident that if he gets the message out, he will win the seat and have a great perch for trying to convince Harvard Corporation to make the necessary changes.

00:40:00
In this section, Harvey Silverglate discusses the importance of freedom of speech and academic freedom in higher education. He argues that it is impossible for students to feel comfortable if liberal education is taken seriously and that one of the primary roles of a college education is to challenge the beliefs that students grew up with. Silverglate believes that free speech and academic freedom are necessary for ideas to clash, and for truth or a better truth to emerge. He is opposed to affirmative action, as he believes that it labels people by their race, religion, and national origin, which is precisely what we do not want people to do.

00:45:00
In this section, Harvey Silverglate predicts that the Supreme Court will vote six to three to abolish affirmative action, as it is a violation of equal protection of the law and hasn't performed its role well in the past 25 years. He suggests that the effort should be put into improving the quality of elementary and secondary education instead of affirmative action. Silverglate believes that the public school system's quality is poor because of the control of the teachers' union, which causes a skewed power balance between the teachers union and taxpayers. He proposes hiring skilled teachers rather than union members and opposes public workers' unions while being supportive of private sector unions.

00:50:00
In this section, Harvey Silverglate talks about his opposition to unions for public employees, such as the National Teachers Association, and believes that the public school system will never improve as long as teachers are unionized. He suggests that the core issue resulting in the inequality of opportunity that affirmative action aims to solve is the Elementary and secondary education system. Silverglate believes that the diversity inclusion and equity programs at universities, such as Harvard and MIT, cover up the wounds of inadequate education at earlier levels. He also discusses the case of Dorian Abbott, a lectured cancelled at MIT, and believes that some universities refrain from the clash of ideas due to fear of hurting people's feelings.

00:55:00
In this section, Harvey Silverglate discusses the importance of the First Amendment for newspapers and how they often give good publicity to cases of censorship which catalyzes embarrassment for the universities involved. He also talks about the controversy surrounding the naming of buildings at universities after donors, with examples like the Sackler Building at Harvard. Silverglate believes that universities need to be more transparent about their mistakes and not hide them if they want to protect the freedom of speech. He also criticizes academic administrators for being thin-skinned, politically correct, and holier-than-thou, saying that he would fire 90-95% of them.

01:00:00
In this section of the podcast, Harvey Silverglate and Lex Fridman discuss the ethics of accepting donations from morally questionable donors. While universities may not want to attach naming rights to buildings that could whitewash the name of a donor who has committed heinous acts such as Jeffrey Epstein, Silverglate argues that universities should not make moral tests of the donors. He believes that accepting money from donors with questionable ethics is a Pandora's box, and while he does have limits, he is not an absolutist. Ultimately, the question of who decides which donations to accept remains a concern.

01:05:00
In this section, Harvey Silverglate discusses his belief that universities should not have a moral test for their donors and that he draws the line at naming rights for buildings. He also talks about the abuse of power in universities, including sexual impropriety towards students, and how there are still people who abuse their power in these institutions. Silverglate believes that the political left has divided between progressives and liberals, and that the former are willing to bend the First Amendment and due process of law in the pursuit of equality. He also talks about critical race theory, which he believes started at Brandeis University, and discusses the theory's goal of artificially increasing the rights of the lower classes and reducing the rights of the upper classes.

01:10:00
In this section of the podcast, Harvey Silverglate discusses his views on true equality and the importance of education as a means to increase opportunities for the lower classes. He believes that true equality cannot be achieved through discrimination but rather by improving the education system and overcoming problems such as teachers unions. Silverglate also emphasizes the importance of protecting academic freedom, even for controversial figures such as Jordan Peterson. He argues that universities have an absolute obligation to protect the academic freedom of even the most controversial faculty members as outliers might hold the key to solving society's ailments. He also expresses his concerns about the hierarchy of seniority in universities and how it can stifle innovation and revolutionary ideas.

01:15:00
In this section of the video, Harvey Silverglate talks about how he was offered a tenure-track position at Harvard Law School, but refused due to it being a bad fit, with administrators overrunning the place and faculty members being afraid to say things. He mentions that he saw this problem emerging as early as the mid-1980s, before co-authoring the book "The Shadow University" in 1998 and co-founding FIRE (Foundation for Individual Rights in Education) in 1999. Silverglate then goes on to share a story about a freshman orientation exercise he witnessed at Hamline University where students were lined up according to their skin hues, and had to describe how their race had affected their success in life. He found this exercise to be demeaning and confirms his distaste for such an approach. Later, the interviewer asks what the role of speech is in giving a platform to controversial figures such as members of the KKK or dictators.

01:20:00
In this section, Harvey Silverglate discusses the importance of facing reality in the world, even if that means acknowledging the unpleasantness that exists such as genocide and discrimination. He believes that words, even if they express unpleasant ideas, are necessary for communicating fact, truth, and reality. Silverglate also speaks about the role of the interviewer when it comes to exposing controversial figures such as Hitler and Epstein. He defends the job of a criminal defense lawyer and says that everyone has the constitutional right to representation, even if they are seen as nasty people. Despite his personal belief, Silverglate explains that his colleague Alan Dershowitz, who is a criminal defense lawyer and represented controversial figures such as Epstein and Trump, is a lifelong Democrat who takes his job seriously and even turned down Trump's invitation to represent him in the second impeachment.

01:25:00
In this section, Harvey Silverglate discusses his close friend and former colleague Alan Dershowitz's professional representation of controversial figures, including former President Donald Trump. While Silverglate admits that some of Dershowitz's clients, like Klaus Farm Bulow, were "pretty nasty people," he believes in the ethical principle that everyone is entitled to a defense, and that Dershowitz's representation of Trump was not political or philosophical but purely professional. Silverglate also criticizes the hypocrisy of those who shunned Dershowitz over his connection to Trump, while expressing concern over the threat to civil liberties posed by the unremitting efforts of Trump's political opponents to "stop him at any cost."

01:30:00
In this section of the interview, Harvey Silverglate discusses political correctness and the 2016 US Presidential election. He recounts an experience at Harvard during election night where faculty members were celebrating a Hillary Clinton victory, only to be disappointed when Donald Trump won the Electoral College. Silverglate believes that preening ambition and its resulting arrogance can blind people to reality, and ultimately led to Trump's victory as a big "F**k you" to political correctness. The conversation then shifts to Silverglate's belief that the FBI should be abolished due to its corrupted culture established by J. Edgar Hoover, making it impossible to reform and ensure agents follow the Constitution. He advises against ever talking to an FBI agent if they come knocking on your door.

01:35:00
In this section, Harvey Silverglate, a well-known lawyer, explains how the FBI works and how they manipulate interviews. He advises his clients to record FBI interviews, as he believes the official records are often inaccurate and that the organization is fundamentally corrupt. Silverglate suggests that the FBI should be abolished, and if there's a need for a federal investigative agency, a wholly new one should be created. He finds wiretapping and electronic surveillance very intrusive and believes that drug cases shouldn't warrant surveillance at all. Silverglate argues that the FBI's goal is to find someone guilty instead of solving cases. Moreover, he refutes the "nothing to hide" argument as the federal criminal code makes it easy to be charged with a crime even when innocent.

01:40:00
In this section, Harvey Silverglate discusses how the Supreme Court has allowed a situation where anything can be made a federal crime if the means of interstate communication or travel are used during the commission of the crime. He argues that this has led to an illusory limitation on the federal government's authority to bring charges in criminal cases and that the feds can indict anyone they want, allowing them to terrorize dissidents. Silverglate also criticizes the current Supreme Court for treating precedents as if they don't have any role and suggests that enlarging the court to get more liberals on it will lead to a constant fiddling with a very important institution. Finally, he reflects on his own mortality and how he didn't expect to live this long due to a genetic predisposition to heart disease from his father, who died at the age of 48 due to smoking.

01:45:00
In this section, Harvey Silverglate reflects on his life and how he managed to make it as a lawyer without joining a law firm. He discusses his elite education at Princeton and Harvard Law School, but notes that attending top institutions isn't a requirement for success. He describes a scenario in which his parents wanted him to marry the daughter of their family physician and take over the medical practice, but after spending a summer in Paris, he decided to become a lawyer and ended the relationship. The transformative experience in Paris had an outsized effect on his life, and he always remembers the famous line from Casablanca, "We'll always have Paris."

01:50:00
In this section, Lex Fridman concludes his conversation with Harvey Silverglate by expressing his appreciation for the work that Silverglate has done in promoting freedom of speech and supporting his run for the Harvard Board of Overseers. Fridman highlights the importance of freedom of speech for universities and American culture, and quotes Harry S Truman warning against the dangers of silencing the voices of opposition, which can lead to increasingly repressive measures and a state of fear for citizens.
