# Summary of Daniel Kahneman: Thinking Fast and Slow, Deep Learning, and AI | Lex Fridman Podcast #65

Daniel Kahneman discusses the difference between thinking fast and slow, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. He describes how humans learn, and how the limits of these technologies are still unknown. He also discusses the challenges of accurately modeling human behavior, and how autonomous vehicles could potentially improve safety by taking into account pedestrian behavior.
Daniel Kahneman discusses the difference between thinking fast and slow, and how deep learning and artificial intelligence can help us understand reality better. However, he warns that we don't yet understand the implications of artificial intelligence reaching human-level intelligence.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Daniel Kahneman discusses the dichotomy between two modes of thought, system one being fast instinctive and emotional, and system two being slower, more deliberative, and more logical. World War II taught him that humans are capable of evil, cruelty, and genocide.

00:05:00
Daniel Kahneman discusses the two modes of thought, the fast instinctive and the slow deliberative, in his book, Thinking Fast and Slow. He describes the differences between the two, and how they are manifested in different ways. The fast instinctive mode is easier to think of as a family of activities, primarily involved in thinking of ideas that come to mind automatically. The slow deliberative mode is more involved in working to produce an idea, and requires time to engage short-term memory and other executive functions.

00:10:00
Daniel Kahneman discusses the difference between thinking fast and slow, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. System 1 is effortless and fast, while system 2 is more like what animals are. System 1 also has language and understands language, speaks for us, and is able to solve complicated problems without thinking. System 1 is better at some things, while system 2 is better at other things.

00:15:00
Daniel Kahneman discusses how deep learning and artificial intelligence are similar to how humans learn, and how the limits of these technologies are still unknown.

00:20:00
Daniel Kahneman discusses the challenges of artificial intelligence, deep learning, and causality. He believes that neural networks are a huge part of this effort, and that active learning is also important for building systems that can learn and anticipate outcomes.

00:25:00
Daniel Kahneman discusses the difficulty of accurately modeling human behavior, and how autonomous vehicles could potentially improve safety by taking into account pedestrian behavior. He also has a follow-up question about where intuition might lead when it comes to safely driving around pedestrians.

00:30:00
Daniel Kahneman discusses the challenges of semi-autonomous vehicles and how the machine will need to rely on humans less and less as the technology improves.

00:35:00
Daniel Kahneman discusses the importance of stories in explaining why people believe things, and how difficult it is for AI researchers to overcome the public's intuition.

00:40:00
Daniel Kahneman discusses the distinction between experiences and memories, how these two aspects of life can be at odds, and how one can pursue happiness by focusing on creating happy memories.

00:45:00
Daniel Kahneman discusses the idea of the " remembering self ," which refers to the self that remembers things, and how that self is changing due to the prevalence of devices that allow for more sharing of experiences. He also discusses the existentialist philosophy of life, and how it might be helpful for individuals to focus on experiencing life rather than remembering things.

00:50:00
Daniel Kahneman discusses the importance of meaning in life, and how it can be found in both positive and negative experiences. He also discusses the distinction between work in the lab and in the real world, and how most people can find meaning in their work, even if it's not in the most "clean" or "good-sized" ways.

00:55:00
Daniel Kahneman discusses the role of collaboration in creativity and scientific discovery, and advises young scientists to be "lucky and have the character for it."

01:00:00
Daniel Kahneman discusses how our personal experiences shape our intuition, and how research into behavioral change is often hindered by weak intuitions. He discusses how a recent study funded by his friends aimed to change people's gym habits by manipulating the conditions in which they worked.

01:05:00
Daniel Kahneman discusses the differences between his work on thinking fast and slow and deep learning and artificial intelligence, and how MTurk has helped increase experimental efficiency.

01:10:00
Daniel Kahneman, a well-known German psychologist, discusses the controversy around his book, "Thinking Fast and Slow." The book discusses the difference between fast and slow thinking, and Kahneman discusses how slow thinking can often lead to incorrect decisions. He also discusses how slow thinking can be a problem when it comes to scientific research, and how it can be difficult to change one's mind.

01:15:00
Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, discusses the difference between thinking fast and slow, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. He describes how each has the ability to improve our understanding of reality, but warns that we don't yet understand what happens when artificial intelligence reaches a human level of intelligence. He encourages listeners to persist in their pursuit of understanding, even if we don't have an answer for what the meaning of life may be.
