# Summary of Biological versus Artificial Neural Networks (John Hopfield) | AI Podcast Clips

The video features John Hopfield discussing biological versus artificial neural networks. Hopfield emphasizes the importance of evolutionary biology in the development of neurons and their unique properties, in contrast to artificial neural networks where such features are suppressed. He also notes the differences between over-generational learning of biological evolution and individual learning from the environment. Additionally, Hopfield highlights the potential for comparing biological and artificial neural networks, noting that it will take generations of refinement in biology and technology to explore their collective properties. Hopfield also discusses the study of the brain and what fields might lead to breakthroughs in understanding it.

In this section, John Hopfield discusses the differences between biological neural networks and artificial neural networks. He explains that evolutionary biology sharpens and develops each quirk and unique property of neurons until it becomes a useful feature rather than a glitch, and such feature capturing is suppressed in artificial neural networks. Hopfield highlights the importance of biological evolution's duplicating and drifting apart mechanism, which retains old functions while new adaptations are developed. Furthermore, he emphasizes that the evolutionary process for artificial neural networks is different from biological networks and lacks the complexity and uniqueness of natural evolution.

In this section, John Hopfield discusses the dual correspondence between biological neural networks and companies as organisms that build and adapt to new markets over time. He notes that while adaptation is everything, there are differences between the over-generational learning of biological evolution and the timescale of individual learning from the environment. He explains that the mathematical systems behind neural networks in computer science are built on the evolutionary system of biology, but the effect of computer structure on what is easy and difficult to solve is immense. While he admits to being in awe of the evolutionary process, he finds it a black hole for understanding what to do, so he's more interested in teasing apart the edges of the single human life scale adaptation and seeing how it works.

In this section, John Hopfield discusses the study of the brain and what fields might lead to breakthroughs in understanding it. Growing up in a physics-focused household, Hopfield views the world with a lens of physics and acknowledges that his problem-picking strategy is characteristic of a physicist's intellectual background which might not be the same as psychology, chemistry or neurobiology's problem-picking strategy, amongst others. Though his idea of 'understanding' is nebulous, he appreciates that feedback is an essential aspect of real systems' computing and thus, recurrent feedback or occurrence are both critical in talking about real systems.

In this section, John Hopfield discusses the potential for comparing biological and artificial neural networks, stating that the AI community can create models of neurobiology, pretend it's good enough, and use it to do various interesting things. However, he emphasizes that each generation of advancement will only get them so far into what a brain does, each time passing the Turing test longer and with broader aspects, but it will likely be generations before we make something that we can consider a human. Hopfield notes that while AI networks have no collective properties, most physical systems that have as many parts as an artificial neural network can have collective properties. Whether there are collective properties used in artificial neural networks for AI remains to see, and it will take several generations of refinement in biology and technology to explore this.
