01:05:00
Dmitri Dolgov discusses the potential for self-driving cars to lead to more user-friendly car interfaces and delightful experiences for riders. He also discusses the potential for ride-sharing companies to improve the customer experience by removing any friction or complexity.

01:10:00
Dmitri Dolgov discusses Waymo's approach to self-driving cars, focusing on the company's focus on safety, privacy, and comfort for passengers. He argues that humans must "flirt" with the rules of the road in order to be efficient and safe, and that Waymo wants to create a driver archetype that is both safe and efficient.

01:15:00
Dmitri Dolgov discusses his experience riding in Waymo's self-driving cars, which he found to be more assertive and efficient than autonomous vehicles typically are. He also discusses how Waymo's trucks differ from autonomous trucking and how the company's fundamental challenges in this area carry over to other aspects of driver training and trucking.

02:15:00
Dmitri Dolgov discusses how our society may go in directions that we wouldn't like it to go, but if anything, that's been heartbreaking to an optimist about 2020 is that society is kind of fragile. He believes that love will be the solution, but unfortunately, he thinks it's less of a flamethrower type of next and more of a slow boil.
