# Summary of Cristos Goodrow: YouTube Algorithm | Lex Fridman Podcast #68

Christos Goodrow, a YouTube engineer, discusses the role of the algorithm in recommending videos to viewers. He notes that the algorithm is constantly improving, and that it is currently better than ever at recommending videos that the viewer might want to watch. He also discusses how YouTube uses machine learning to understand what content is most popular, and how to use that information to better serve users.
Cristos Goodrow discusses the YouTube algorithm and how it affects content creators. He explains that the algorithm is based on a number of human and machine learning systems that work together to produce the site's overall "behavior." Goodrow also discusses the importance of taking breaks and managing one's mental health in order to maintain a successful YouTube career.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Christos Kudrow discusses the role of the YouTube algorithm in the world of online education and how it can help people achieve their goals. He also discusses the impact of the algorithm on content creators and viewers.

00:05:00
Cristos Goodrow discusses the challenges of introducing diversity into YouTube videos, and how YouTube uses clustering to try and find similar videos for potential viewers. He also talks about how YouTube uses embedding and measurement to determine which videos might be a good fit for a viewer.

00:10:00
Cristos Goodrow discusses how the YouTube algorithm works and how it tries to reduce the proliferation of meanness on the platform. He also discusses how creators can become resilient to meanness, and points out that it is important to solve the issue.

00:15:00
In this YouTube video, Cristos Goodrow discusses the role of algorithms and human input in moderating YouTube comments. He points out that while algorithms are important, moderating YouTube comments requires human judgement. He also discusses how YouTube is trying to strike a balance between openness and responsibility, and how both machine learning and human input are necessary to achieve this.

00:20:00
The YouTube algorithm uses a variety of techniques to recommend videos to viewers. The algorithm is constantly improving, and it is currently better than ever at recommending videos that the viewer might want to watch.

00:25:00
Cristos Goodrow, a YouTube engineer, discusses the related graph, which is used to group similar videos together. This helps users more easily find videos they may be interested in.

00:30:00
Cristos Goodrow discusses how YouTube algorithm works, focusing on measures of quality such as views and time spent watching. He goes on to say that the "time that someone spends watching a video is related to the value that they get from that video." This is not good enough, as users may not be satisfied with what they watch even after watching it for a long time. To improve the quality of recommendations, YouTube uses user feedback to train its machine learning system.

00:35:00
Cristos Goodrow discusses how YouTube uses machine learning to understand what content is most popular, and how to use that information to better serve users. He also discusses the value of title, description, and keywords data in search and video content itself.

00:40:00
Cristos Goodrow discusses how the title and description of a video can help the algorithm determine whether or not it is a video about World of Warcraft. He also notes that it is important for creators to try to satisfy the intent of their viewers in order to help the system work well.

00:45:00
Cristos Goodrow discusses how he thinks the algorithm is manipulated to be more popular and attractive to viewers. He also discusses how the algorithm can be helpful in its ability to personalize content for each individual.

00:50:00
Cristos Goodrow discusses the possible impact of YouTube on society, noting that the platform has allowed for greater communication and understanding among different groups of people.

00:55:00
Cristos Goodrow, a YouTube creator for nine years, talks about the importance of creator versus video connections on YouTube, how YouTube is changing society, and the psychological challenges and burnout creators can experience.

01:00:00
Cristos Goodrow discusses the YouTube algorithm and its various components. He explains that the algorithm is based on a number of human and machine learning systems that work together to produce the site's overall "behavior." Taking breaks and managing one's mental health are important factors in maintaining a successful YouTube career.

01:05:00
Cristos Goodrow discusses the algorithm used to determine what videos to recommend to viewers on YouTube, and how experiments are used to measure the impact of changes made to the site.

01:10:00
Cristos Goodrow discusses the idea of "clipping" or including short clips of your videos to make them easier to find and watch. He also talks about the importance of making your videos easy to find and watch, and how to do that.

01:15:00
In a future where the YouTube algorithm detects which parts of a video are "exciting," this could lead to more people being exposed to deep, clear explanations of complex topics.

01:20:00
Cristos Goodrow discusses the challenges of understanding video and the need for more sophisticated machine learning techniques. He believes that self-supervised learning will be the solution to achieving greater levels of intelligence.

01:25:00
Cristos Goodrow discusses the potential for YouTube to become more than just a video hosting site, and discusses some of the ways in which it has already enriched people's lives. He also discusses the potential for the platform to become more responsible in terms of its impact on society, and the importance of creating great videos for users.

01:30:00
Cristos Goodrow discusses the YouTube algorithm and how it can impact content creators. He also thanks his presenting sponsor, Cash App, and mentions a stem education nonprofit that inspires hundreds of thousands of young minds. Finally, Goodrow encourages viewers to subscribe to his YouTube channel, give it five stars, and follow him on social media.
