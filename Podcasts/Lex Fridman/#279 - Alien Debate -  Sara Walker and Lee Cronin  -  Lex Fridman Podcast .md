# Summary of Alien Debate: Sara Walker and Lee Cronin | Lex Fridman Podcast #279

In this YouTube video, Sara Walker and Lee Cronin debate the idea of aliens and whether or not they would visit Earth. Walker argues that aliens would want to seek out examples of the phenomena they are to understand themselves better, while Cronin argues that aliens would come to Earth to find out about our culture. They also discuss the idea that mathematics is the best example of an abstraction that exists in the universe and is therefore physical.
In this video, Sara Walker and Lee Cronin debate the possibility of alien life. Walker argues that the universe has enough memory to support complex life, while Cronin maintains that cosmological selection would have to occur to allow for this to happen. The two also discuss the possibility of building tools to simulate the behavior of high assembly index objects.
In this video, Sara Walker and Lee Cronin debate the possibility of intelligent aliens and first contact. Walker argues that aliens would only be present in a unquestionable way when we make contact with them, while Cronin believes that first contact would be when we realize that aliens exist and we are just not able to capture them coherently.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
In this podcast, Sara Walker and Lee Cronin discuss their viewpoints on the possibility of intelligent alien life and whether or not they would visit Earth. Walker believes that other intelligent aliens would want to seek out examples of the phenomena they are to understand themselves better, and Cronin agrees. They also discuss Tyson's tweet about aliens not caring about visiting Earth.

00:05:00
The two interviewees discuss the idea that humans are interesting to aliens because of our curiosity and intelligence. Lee Cronin argues that if aliens exist, they will come find us because they want to find out about our culture. Sara Walker argues that if aliens exist, some of them may have already made contact with humans, and that it would be an interesting experience for both parties.

00:10:00
This podcast discusses the idea that there is something more profound and mysterious about life than we currently understand, and that aliens would likely categorize humans as something less than intelligent. Sara Walker and Lee Cronin debate the plausibility of different scenarios involving alien life, and Walker concludes that curiosity is a more powerful force in the universe than violence or the will to power.

00:15:00
In the video, Sara Walker and Lee Cronin discuss the concept of life and how to define it. Walker identifies as a physicist and Cronin identifies as a chemist. They discuss the idea that life is the mechanism by which the universe explores its space of what's possible. They also discuss the idea that life is evidence of thought and the lineage of objects that it produces.

00:20:00
Alien debate: Sara Walker and Lee Cronin discuss the concept of assembly theory, which is the theory that complex objects are created from simpler ones. Walker says that if the mechanism that creates objects years ago was actually implemented, it would result in a molecule with the ability to copy itself, but with some variability. This would then lead to the creation of more complex objects, which is what life is all about. Cronin argues that in order to create complex objects, something with a high assembly number (the number of copies of a molecule that are assembled together) is necessary. However, once an object becomes more autonomous and integrated over time, it makes the transition to becoming a low-memory object, which is what physicists are.

00:25:00
In this video, Sara Walker and Lee Cronin discuss the concept of "assembly theory", which suggests that there is a certain complexity threshold in the universe above which life begins to exist. They also debate the significance of an assembly index, which is a measure of how many objects in a particular space have a high assembly number. Finally, they discuss the possibility of inferring the history of an individual from their physical appearance in an assembly space.

00:30:00
The video discusses the theory of assemblyindex, which measures the complexity of objects. Sara Walker and Lee Cronin discuss the concept of hyperobjects, which are objects that are too large for us to understand in full. Daniel andambershek, Sara's postdoc and Lee's postdoc, disagreed with the theory, stating that it cannot be explained in a scientific manner.

00:35:00
The video discusses how assembly theory can be used to infer the properties of an unknown object, such as their language, technology, and other bits and pieces. It also discusses how the shortest path is intrinsic and measurable, and how all aliens in a causality graph have a common ancestor.

00:40:00
In the video, Sara Walker and Lee Cronin discuss the concept of constraints in space, time, and the universe. They explain that the concept of constraints is important for understanding the universe, and that as the universe becomes larger and more complex, more things can happen in the future. They also discuss the concept of assembly, and how it can allow for the communication of events that happened billions of years ago.

00:45:00
In this video, Sara Walker and Lee Cronin debate the existence of abstractions such as mathematics. Walker argues that abstractions are physical objects that exist in the universe, while Cronin argues that abstractions are merely abstractions and do not exist in a physical form. Ultimately, Walker argues that mathematics is the best example of an abstraction that exists in the universe and is therefore physical.

00:50:00
In this YouTube video, Sara Walker and Lee Cronin debate the idea that mathematics was invented by life. Walker argues that mathematics exists independently of life, while Cronin argues that mathematics is a product of life. Walker says that mathematics is the most efficient way to label graphs, while Cronin says that mathematics retains its properties when copied between physical systems. They also discuss the idea that mathematics allows for the overlap of causal graphs, and the idea that it is the language that humanity shares that allows for communication between different cultures.

00:55:00
Sara Walker and Lee Cronin discuss the difference between "invented" and "discovered." Walker argues that mathematics was invented, while Cronin believes that it was discovered. They also discuss the idea of communication, and discuss whether or not aliens would have binary.

01:00:00
The speaker talks about the difficulty of predicting what aliens will look like and technologies they might have, and how it is difficult to imagine the space of aliens. They posit that one of the reasons life emerges in chemistry is because it is the first scale to build up objects from elementary objects, and that the number of possible things that can exist is greater than the universe. They go on to say that it is difficult to imagine what the space of aliens might be, as it is possible for two planets to have a chemistry that leads to the evolution of aliens.

01:05:00
In this video, Sara Walker and Lee Cronin discuss the possibility of detecting aliens before they are detected by us, as well as the potential benefits of binary communication. Walker suggests that binary communication could be used to attract aliens and work out if they are a friend or foe. Cronin argues that the great filter is a false theory that assumes that something terrible happened to aliens to prevent them from traveling to Earth.

01:10:00
The two panelists discuss the possibility of life beyond Earth and the possible physical filters that need to be in place for us to see it. Sara Walker believes that it is literally we don't have the technology to see aliens, while Lee Cronin believes that there is a great perceptual filter in the sense that a species must acquire a certain amount of knowledge and technology in order to recognize phenomena. The two also discuss the possibility of building tools to simulate the behavior of high assembly index objects.

01:15:00
The video discusses the idea that once we understand what alien life is, it will be everywhere due to the universality of physics. Sara Walker and Lee Cronin have disagreements on how many aliens are out there, but they both agree that assembly theory can help us appreciate that alien life is everywhere. The human mind is fascinating, and thought experiments like counter-factuals are helpful in building new theories.

01:20:00
The author discusses the idea that there may be a limit to the number of planets that can support life, and that this may be due to resource limitations. He goes on to say that memory may emerge as a result of heterogeneity in matter.

01:25:00
The physicist Sara Walker and the chemist Lee Cronin debate the possibility of complex life emerging from chemistry. Walker believes that the universe has enough memory to support complex life, while Cronin maintains that cosmological selection would have to occur to allow for this to happen.

01:30:00
Sara Walker and Lee Cronin debate the possibility that humans are the only life form in the universe. Walker argues that life can occur quickly and that Earth is special, while Cronin argues that life is difficult to come by, and that humans are fortunate because of the rare cascading effect of elements. Walker suggests trying to engineer life in the lab, while Cronin suggests searching for life on the moon.

01:35:00
In this video, Lee Cronin and Sara Walker discuss the possibility of alien life, and how a successful search for it could help us better understand physics. Cronin notes that, while the question of life's origins is a big one, spending more money on looking for gravity waves rather than finding life is a mistake. Walker agrees, and says that, if we figure out the origin of life, that won't be the end of the line for understanding what it is.

01:40:00
In this video, Sara Walker and Lee Cronin debate the possibility of creating life in the lab, with Walker arguing that it is not obvious that you will get to the deep understanding of what life is. Cronin points out that cellular automata are simple systems that can become more complex if they are run on a computer. Walker argues that you can't simulate the engine of life, and that is why you need to create life in the lab.

01:45:00
In the video, Lee Cronin and Sara Walker discuss the idea of time and how it is used in experiments. Cronin says that time is a real thing, and until he can explain it more elegantly, he will just get into more trouble. Walker says that time is also an idea and is useful for measuring experiments.

01:50:00
In this video, Sara Walker and Lee Cronin discuss the idea of what exists outside of the universe. Walker is agnostic as to what exists outside of the universe, but thinks that the most interesting things for us to be doing are finding explanations that allow us to do more physics. Cronin argues that there is room for a necessary being in assembly theory.

01:55:00
In this video, Sara Walker and Lee Cronin discuss the idea of whether or not there exists a deity or mechanism beyond the universe. Walker argues that, if existence is the default, then many gods or machines exist. Cronin argues that existence is not the default and that, if existence is the default, then many computers exist. They continue to argue about the deeper question of why there seems to be meaning and purpose in the universe, with Cronin ultimately saying that the physics of life is what provides this.

02:00:00
The two panelists discuss the idea of God, with Walker believing that God is something more sophisticated than a mere "intelligence," while Cronin believes that God is simply the physical universe itself, and can be described in terms of assembly theory.

02:05:00
In this video, Sara Walker and Lee Cronin discuss the idea of goals in neural networks, and how assembly theory may be able to help us understand how they work.

02:10:00
According to the author, only conscious beings can have conscious goals, and the goal of an object is only observable across time. To be able to have a goal, an object must have an update and sensing, and must be able to enact causation in response to its environment. Humans have imagination, which allows us to create and observe objects that don't actually exist.

02:15:00
The author of the essay argues that in a deterministic universe, we have freedom but no free will. He also argues that time is a real thing and that the universe has been expanding since the beginning.

02:20:00
The video discusses the concept of time and its importance. It explains that time can be divided into two concepts: the causal graph, which is the order of events, and the thermodynamic arrow of time, which is the increase of entropy. It argues that the universe has a directional flow, and that reversibility is an emergent property.

02:25:00
Sara Walker and Lee Cronin discuss the concept of time, arguing that it is fundamental and exists as a physical thing that creates space. To prove that time is always creating new novelty, scientists must prove that it is always expanding in the state space.

02:30:00
The speaker argues that free will is necessary for the universe to be as creative as possible because it allows for individual autonomy and agency. He also believes that consciousness is related to imagination, and that human level intelligence is different from the intelligence of other organisms because humans can imagine things that have never existed.

02:35:00
In this video, Sara Walker and Lee Cronin discuss the idea of free will, and Walker concludes that it is possible in a deterministic world. Cronin argues that free will is an illusion created by the mind, and Walker responds by saying that imagination exists in the present moment and is a readout of what is happening in the causal history of the universe.

02:40:00
The video discusses the idea that free will exists in imagination, and that by reinterpreting our past, we have more freedom to change our future.

02:45:00
Sara Walker and Lee Cronin debate the possibility of first contact with intelligent aliens. Walker argues that the first time humans would cite aliens as being present in a unquestionable way would be when we make contact with them in a way similar to how we make contact with other forms of life, such as through the discovery of anomalies in space. Cronin believes that first contact would be when humans realize that aliens exist and that we are just not able to capture them coherently.

02:50:00
The two of the biggest disagreements between Sara Walker and Lee Cronin regards the question of whether or not life can form on a planet without any other life forms, and the possibility of multiple alien civilizations existing on a single planet.

02:55:00
The two speakers discuss the concept of origin, and how it is easier for humans to define because evolution allows for variation in technology and chemistry. They also discuss how selection weeds out the bad genes from populations, and how major extinction events allow for novel species to emerge. They also discuss how humans should retain compassion for other living things, and how the extinction of the dinosaurs allowed for the development of human civilization.

03:00:00
The video discusses the idea that, due to the way that evolution works, some individuals will suffer and die. Sara Walker and Lee Cronin discuss the idea that, because life persists through the traces of its participants, death is a fundamental part of life. They also mention the example of Einstein, who left a lot of Easter eggs for future scientists to find.

03:05:00
In this YouTube video, Sara Walker and Lee Cronin discuss the possibility of engineering life at different levels, from chemistry to humanoid. They discuss how technology and evolution are leading us closer to creating artificial general intelligence, which may one day be able to copy and understand life on a level similar to that of humans.

03:10:00
The video discusses the idea of "philosophical zombies," or beings that are facsimiles of living organisms but lack the emotional response of a living being. It argues that this can create a feeling of "uncanny valley" when interacting with robots, as we are looking at an object that is in the future but borrows from a structure we have common history with. The video also discusses the potential for increasing creativity over time as we better understand how machines work.

03:15:00
The two discuss the idea that love is more complex than simply empathy. They go on to discuss the idea that humans have the ability to be surprising and creative. They also discuss the idea that there is comprehension in reality below language and that eventually humans will be able to understand the gap between comprehension and language.

03:20:00
The two speakers in this YouTube video debate the idea that it is possible to copy someone, and whether or not this would result in two versions of the same person that are equally happy. Lex Fridman argues that this is not possible, as the feature space of a person would change if every atom in their body was copied. Sara Walker counters that this is not true if an artificial copy is created that is faithful to the past, and that novelty is the ability to create new architectures that are not found in nature. They also debate the idea that free will exists, with Walker arguing that it does not work instantaneously and is more of a macro level concept.

03:25:00
In this video, Sara Walker and Lee Cronin discuss the idea that humans are special because they can generate novelty, which they define as something that has never occurred before. Cronin argues that this is a good thing, but Walker wonders if it's possible to generate too much novelty and create something that's not truly special. Cronin responds that it's impossible to know for sure, but that Bayesian approaches can be used to find a point of novelty that is intrinsic to the experiment or to the robot.

03:30:00
In this video, Sara Walker and Lee Cronin discuss the idea of "novelty" and how it relates to intelligence in robots. Walker argues that creativity is more active than surprise, and Cronin agrees. They also discuss the idea of beauty and how it can be used to judge the qualities of a system. Finally, Cronin talks about the importance of having theories with a wide range of possibilities, in order to allow for the most successful future predictions.

03:35:00
Sara Walker, a biologist, and Lee Cronin, a physicist, discuss the idea that life is a fundamental part of the universe, and the beauty of assembly theory, which explains why life exists and how it interacts with the physical world. Cronin says that while the current physics of life is not incompatible with life, there are still gaps in our understanding that assembly theory could help to fill.

03:40:00
Sara Walker and Lee Cronin debate the existence of the soul, with Walker believing it is an intrinsic property of all objects in the universe and Cronin believing it is the monology of individual objects. Cronin also believes that the existence of life has a profound impact on the future of the universe, with Walker agreeing that life is a privilege.

03:45:00
In this YouTube video, Sara Walker and Lee Cronin discuss the concept of "alien debate" and share their personal opinions on the topic. Walker believes that Kim Kardashian would be the best possible person to have as an alien, while Cronin argues that it would be interesting to be a part of the latest arm processor. Both speakers mention otherworldly goals they would like to accomplish if they were alone on Earth, with Walker mentioning wanting to walk all of the land on Earth and Cronin wanting to take a computer to Mars and make drugs there.

03:50:00
Both Walker and Cronin share examples of times when they were helped by a kind older person, and Cronin gives advice to young scientists on how to generate novelty.

03:55:00
Sara Walker and Lee Cronin discuss the idea of an alien invasion and the potential for humans to defend themselves. Walker recommends being random and confusing the aliens, while Cronin believes that focusing on specific aspects of one's life could be a wiser choice.

04:00:00
In this video, Sara Walker and Lee Cronin discuss the idea of whether or not aliens exist. Walker says that, if the thing was to stay alive, she would rather lose all of her old memories again than never be able to make new ones. Cronin agrees, stating that most of our lived experience is actually in our memories. They also discuss the idea that humanity is ingenious, and that hope gives them comfort on bad days. Finally, Cronin shares his thoughts on what gives him hope: the existence of wild minds like his.

04:05:00
In this video, Sara Walker and Lee Cronin discuss the idea of whether or not aliens exist. Walker argues that there is evidence to support the idea that aliens exist, while Cronin argues that there is not enough evidence to support the idea. They discuss the possible reasons why aliens might exist and the implications of their existence.
