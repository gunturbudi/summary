Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses the idea that the human brain has three parts, each with its own function. She disagrees with Plato's description of the psyche as consisting of two parts, instincts and emotions. She points out that the idea of a mind was not universally accepted in ancient Greece, and that in the 20th century, a popular view of brain evolution held that the human brain has evolved in three stages.

00:20:00
Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses how the brain is not as simple as originally thought, with different parts of the brain working in different ways depending on the situation. She also discusses how the brain is not solely responsible for our emotions, and how the law is based on a faulty understanding of the brain.

00:25:00
Lisa Feldman Barrett argues that the brain works in a way that is counterintuitive to what we traditionally think. The brain is constantly making predictions about the world and the body, and relies on past experiences to help it make those predictions.

00:30:00
The video discusses how the brain works and how it predicts what will happen next based on past experience. It also discusses how reflexes are when the brain doesn't check against the sense data that the potential cost to you is so great.

00:35:00
Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses the idea that sense data is not necessary for consciousness, and that the brain evolved to be in service of motor control. She argues that free will is an observation, not a fact, and that the brain is capable of more sophisticated actions than an amphioxus.

00:40:00
The video discusses how the brain works, focusing on the idea that it uses past experiences to predict what will happen next. It discusses the concept of free will, and points out that it may be less certain than we think.

00:45:00
Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses how the brain processes information, with emphasis on how the brain relies on sense input to function normally. She explains that humans are born with a predisposition towards certain abilities, which must be nurtured in order to develop.

00:50:00
In this video, Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses how the brain works and the importance of social input. She also discusses how the brain can learn and adapt to new experiences, and how different ways of rearing children can be advantageous for the species. Barrett also points out that there are limits to what the brain can do and that variety is important for the brain.

00:55:00
Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses how the brain functions and how different people can enjoy different things, such as novelty. She also mentions that some things, such as reality, are still unknown.

01:00:00
Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses the idea that the brain operates without our awareness, constantlyasking itself hypothetical questions and selecting from a range of possible answers. The network involved in this process is active all the time, except when we are asleep.

She discusses how emotions can be measured using different methods and how they are similar to expressions of emotion seen in our ancestors.

01:10:00
Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses the idea that the brain is constantly constructing concepts, or emotions, on the fly. This process is based on past experiences and predicts what will be sensed based on current motor and visceral predictions.

01:15:00
Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses how the brain constructs concepts, including emotions, by predicting which features are common among instances of a given concept. This process involves constructing a prototype, which is a representation of the most typical instance of the concept, and then reading off features of the prototype when asked for the concept.

01:20:00
Lisa Feldman Barrett argues that concepts, such as species, are a type of conceptual category, and that this concept is based on a function. Concepts vary in their features, but they share a common function. This concept is what allows humans to make civilization.

01:25:00
Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses how emotions are similar to money, countries, kings and queens, presidents, and other concepts that we impose meaning on.

01:50:00
Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses the way the brain works and how certain predictions are reinforced or abandoned depending on the situation. She also discusses a scientist who has researched how social rules and norms are based on the brain's predictions about how an individual will respond.

01:55:00
Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses the idea that the brain is allostational, meaning that it constantly makes predictions and adjusts its metabolism in response. She goes on to discuss how empathy requires foraging for information that is novel and unexpected for someone who is unlike oneself.
