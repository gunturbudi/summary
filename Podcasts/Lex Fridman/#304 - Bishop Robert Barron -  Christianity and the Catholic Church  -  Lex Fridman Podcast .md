Bishop Robert Barron explains that according to Christianity, who is God? Aquinas says that God is not in any genus and that to say in God essence and existence coincide is to say God's very nature is to be. He goes on to say that anything in the world would be a being of some type or an event of some type, but God is not an entity in the world. He says that, even though our knowledge begins always in this world, we can through metaphysical analysis and philosophical reasoning come to some knowledge of a reality which is transcendent to our experience.

Bishop Robert Barron explains that pride is the deadliest of the capital sins and it is very simple to see why. Pride causes us to become caved in around ourselves, like a black hole, and it kills us off. However, compared to moments when we are lost in something, when we are just talking to a friend, those are the best moments in life because we are not consumed by pride. Dante's image of Satan in the Divine Comedy is a great example of pride in action.

He explains that, as monotheists, we believe in one God who is a play of persons, and that the father is an important part of this play. In understanding love, we must strive to understand the other person as well as ourselves, and the father is a key figure in helping us do this.
