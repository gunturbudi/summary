Manolis Kellis explains how the epigenome plays a role in controlling the activity of thousands of genes, and how it can be used to change the expression of certain genes. He also talks about the importance of the epigenome in human life and how it can be used to control the stability of the US economy.

00:10:00
The professor discusses how the environment affects a gene's performance, and how epigenetics play a role in this. He goes on to discuss how selection occurs at multiple levels, including at the level of the organism, the environment, and the genome. He concludes by saying that it would be fascinating to break down selection into even smaller levels.

00:15:00
The video discusses the origin of human genes and the various branches of human evolution. It discusses the genetic evidence for conflict between tribes, and the genetic evidence for love between different tribes.

00:20:00
Manolis Kellis discusses the evolution of intelligent life, and how it is a shame so many different species have died out. He also talks about dolphins and how they are likely intelligent, and how humans would be able to communicate with them if we ever discovered a habitable planet outside of Earth.

00:25:00
Manolis Kellis discusses how life evolved on Earth, how it became harder for life to evolve on the surface, and how dolphins went back into the water because they are mammals.

00:30:00
Manolis Kellis discusses the origins of life, humans, ideas, suffering, and happiness. He argues that life on Earth evolved from the surface or from the bottom, depending on the tide. Cells evolved to replicate, and energy was exploited to create the basic ingredients of life. Manolis Kellis also discusses the role of RNA in the early stages of life.

00:35:00
Manolis Kellis discusses the origin of life, humans, ideas, suffering, and happiness. He argues that the first step in the evolution of life was the random emergence of RNA molecules that then led to the evolution of proteins and DNA. He predicts that non-DNA-based life forms will be discovered in the future and that it is an exciting prospect.

00:40:00
Manolis Kellis discusses the idea that life on other planets may challenge physics, and how it supersedes it. He also discusses the unmistakable signs of life, and how it creates a compartmentalization that starts pushing things away and keeps things inside itself. Finally, he discusses how, as a scientist, he would look for signs of life on other planets.

00:45:00
Manolis Kellis discusses the different levels of life, from the simplest to the most complex. He explains how humans have surpassed the simpler forms of life, and how the transformation from zine to f-zine requires a cooperation and specialization not found in other forms of life.

00:50:00
Manolis Kellis discusses the origins of life, humans, ideas, suffering, and happiness. He points out that some interesting transformations have taken place on Earth, including the development of free will and the expansion of human lifespan. He also notes that while some of these changes are due to evolutionary advances, others are due to medical advancements.

00:55:00
Manolis Kellis discusses the concept of expanding the human lifespan and the possibility of humans traveling to other planets, as well as living forever one day at a time. He argues that regardless of the time scale, living forever would be an amazing experience.

01:00:00
Manolis Kellis discusses the idea that life is more interesting than physics, and that the brain is a thing that resists life.

01:05:00
Manolis Kellis has a mid-life crisis and realizes that life is not a rat race. He recommends that people watch his symposium on YouTube to gain transformative advice.

01:10:00
Manolis Kellis discusses the meaning of life and how different views of it can be fulfilling. He writes about how in Greece, people have come up with some good ideas about how to live a fulfilling life, even in the face of hardship. He talks about the need for more realistic movies about life, and how society does a poor job of preparing people for the reality of it.

01:15:00
Manolis Kellis discusses the various songs that have impacted his life and how they have taught him about the importance of suffering and happiness. He emphasizes that these lessons are not meant to glorify misery, but to teach children that life can be difficult and that it is okay to cry.

01:20:00
In this video, Manolis Kellis discusses the idea that humans are able to find happiness in even the harshest circumstances.
