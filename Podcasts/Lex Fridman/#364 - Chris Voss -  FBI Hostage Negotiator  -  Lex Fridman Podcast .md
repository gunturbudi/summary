Detail Summary:

In this section, former FBI hostage and crisis negotiator Chris Voss discusses the importance of understanding the feelings of the kidnappers during a negotiation. Voss explains that in the kidnapping business, the bad guys will continue until they feel like they have gotten everything they can, and this is when negotiations will be over. Human emotions drive all negotiations, and in kidnapping negotiations, it is vital to work with family members who are often coaching people. Additionally, Voss explains that bad guys often pick a media channel of choice, which tells negotiators an awful lot about their motives and beliefs. Finally, Voss discusses how empathy is in the eye of the beholder, and in every negotiation, it is essential to understand how the other side sees it.

00:05:00
In this section, former FBI hostage negotiator Chris Voss explains how kidnappers are good at figuring out the value of human life and how much money someone can pay. The key to kidnapping negotiations comes down to understanding the emotions and feelings of the kidnappers. Voss also tackles the idea of empathy versus reason, pointing out that reason is always emotion-based since human reasoning begins with what they care about. He further clarifies that the original definition of empathy comes from assessing art's meaning, which involves understanding the interpretation of the artist and not necessarily sharing the same thing.

00:10:00
In this section, Chris Voss explains the difference between empathy and agreement, and the power of empathy in communication with those you may not agree with. He shares an example where he was able to understand where Putin was coming from without agreeing with his methodology. Voss believes that showing empathy is potent and requires no agreement whatsoever. Although signaling a drop of compassion or sympathy can help make empathy more effective, it should not be too deep during adversarial situations or else it might come across as disingenuous.

00:15:00
In this section, Chris Voss talks about how he doesn't need to be on someone's side to make a great deal, but rather he prioritizes empathy in negotiations. He shares a story about a lawyer named Tom Girardi who always talked about a point in the future where both parties could be in a phenomenal place together and work their way back from there. Chris also emphasizes the importance of painting a vision of the future that the other party will like and removing yourself as a threat.

00:20:00
In this section, Chris Voss emphasizes the importance of sequencing and timing in negotiations. He explains that being adversarial does not mean closing off the other person's mind by showing a different opinion. The chapter in Manukian's book titled "The Tension Between Empathy and Assertiveness" is a red herring because empathy puts one in a position to assert, and there is no tension. Voss recommends proactive listening, which involves anticipating where the other person is going, thus dialing in more. He explains that the brain is largely negative, and the best way to deactivate negativity is by calling it out. Neuroscience backs up the idea that calling out negativity deactivates it.

00:25:00
In this section of the transcript, Chris Voss and Lex Fridman talk about the difference between conversations and negotiations. While negotiations seek closure and resolution, conversations are focused on exploring ideas. Voss explains his definition of negotiation as seeking collaboration, rather than closure or goals. He emphasizes that implementation is the real problem of any negotiation, and that the yeses you get in a negotiation are usually aspirational and counterfeit without the how. The conversation then delves into the topic of exploring the minds of interesting people, and how different world views can be thought-provoking and useful in negotiation.

00:30:00
In this section, former FBI hostage negotiator Chris Voss discusses the misconception about the policy of not negotiating with terrorists, clarifying that it's not policy and that presidents from both sides of the aisle have made concessions to terrorists. He also talks about the recent negotiation over prisoners between the US and other countries, stating that there should be negotiations and deals, as long as politicians don't contradict what they claim, and they don't put more of these bad guys back on a battlefield. Moreover, he emphasizes the value of meeting in person during negotiations, citing an example of Ukraine's war, where if Putin, Zelenski, and Biden were put in a room together, it could speed up a solution.

00:35:00
In this section, Chris Voss discusses how negotiating and holding conversations in person can lead to peace in tense geopolitical conflicts. He cites the example of the Mideast peace negotiations during the Clinton administration, where Israeli Prime Ministers and Arafat were brought together regularly, and they started seeing each other as human beings. By understanding each other better, they began to realize that people dying was stupid, and they slowly worked things out. Voss believes that the key skill in achieving this is empathy, and when people feel deeply understood, they bond and become more honest with each other. He urges world leaders to meet in person to have a good conversation, with as few people in the room as possible, to achieve intimacy and power in negotiations coupled with empathy.

00:40:00
In this section, Chris Voss discusses the difference between in-person communication and virtual communication. He believes that there is an energetic feel that changes in person and that we do not have the measurement tools to define it yet. While virtual communication during the pandemic was necessary, Voss argues that it is not the same as in-person communication. Additionally, Voss talks about the importance of hearing responses in negotiation and why the phrase "that's right" is crucial. He gives an example of Donald Trump, whom he regards as a great marketer but not a good negotiator, and how Trump's followers' bond with him using such phrases as "that's right." Voss also mentions his past experiences with Trump and mutual acquaintances.

00:45:00
In this section, Chris Voss shares thoughts on the Trump Administration's negotiation with North Korea, which he believes was masterful in its opening of dialogue with Kim Jong-un. However, he notes that the lack of a deal made after the initial excitement led to confusion among the general public. Chris dismisses accusations of Trump being a narcissist, asking if placing labels like that is just a convenient way of disregarding the complexity of an individual as a human being. He emphasizes that tough negotiations, like hostages, should be approached with integrity and a focus on the best chance of success, or else it is better to walk away.

00:50:00
In this section, Chris Voss discusses the importance of recognizing high-risk indicators and clusters of behavior when negotiating. He also emphasizes the need to walk away from a deal if necessary, even if it means losing a lot of money or hurting people. Voss draws from his experience as an FBI hostage negotiator to explain that failing negotiations often occur because the bad guys were never there to make a deal or were on a killing journey. He also offers hope and advice for achieving peace in the Middle East, suggesting that both sides ultimately want a better future for their children.

00:55:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and how it was handled on Clubhouse, a voice app where people can have anonymous conversations. When Israel was shelling Gaza, they hit a press office that Hamas had used to store weapons. A friend had been hosting rooms on Clubhouse about the conflict, and the speaker joined to show that people can have conversations without devolving into screaming matches. The rule was that before disagreeing with someone, you had to state their position and continue to stay at their position until they agreed that you understood it. Though some on the Israeli side were better able to articulate the Palestinian position, the conversation did not devolve into arguments. The speaker highlights the benefit of trying to see the other side's perspective and articulating it, an exercise that can be beneficial to anyone having a conversation across the table from someone else.

01:00:00
In this section, former FBI hostage negotiator, Chris Voss, discusses the importance of empathy in negotiations. Voss explains that by articulating deeply what the other side feels, both parties can experience a transformative process. Talking about his toughest negotiation, he says working with family members of hostages was challenging as they were not to be deceived about the potential outcome. Voss also talks about the shuhari concept, where individuals who have trained and repeated enough become unconscious, make up their rules and become masters. He cites a real-life example of how he successfully applied empathy when negotiating with family members of hostages of Al-Qaeda.

01:05:00
In this section, former FBI hostage negotiator Chris Voss explains how he approached families of hostages held by Al-Qaeda as someone who understands their emotions, even if the facts show their loved one voluntarily entered a war zone. He also discusses how language and communication style can create a barrier, but that empathy allows for tailoring negotiations to how the other person sees things. Voss shares his three voices of communication: the assertive voice, the analyst voice, and the accommodator voice, and notes how while individuals may be affected by their environment, they can still boil down to one of these three types.

01:10:00
In this section, Chris Voss discusses the importance of understanding different voices, such as the accommodator and assertive voices, in negotiations. He emphasizes that the assertive tone of voice is almost always counterproductive and instead recommends the importance of being nice, slowing down, and being clear. He notes that even assertive people can be taught to use other voices effectively. Additionally, he advises negotiators to avoid making the other party dumber and never to attack them, as it will never hold long-term value, but instead seeks to make profitable deals with others.

01:15:00
In this section, Chris Voss discusses the limitations of studies on negotiation tactics, particularly strategic umbrage. He argues that simulated negotiations with college students are flawed, as they lack the ongoing implementation of a deal, and therefore have no real skin in the game. He then defines strategic umbrage as the use of anger to bully the other side into an agreement, and notes that while it can be effective, empathy remains the best technique for success. He also explains the mirroring technique, which involves repeating one to three words that the other person said to signal to them that you are truly listening. While some find it awkward, it is a simple and effective hack for better communication.

01:20:00
In this section, former FBI hostage negotiator Chris Voss explains the power of using a person's name and how it can be a genuine way to encourage someone, but manipulators may also use this tactic. He also discusses the use of labeling emotions or affect and how it can lead to progress in a conversation if done with insight and awareness, but may be counterproductive if used without actually listening. Voss emphasizes the importance of empathy and active listening in negotiation and how nonverbal cues like silence can build intimacy and trust in a conversation.

01:25:00
In this section, Chris Voss discusses different negotiation techniques, including the power of silence and creating the illusion of control. He emphasizes that silence can be a powerful tool in negotiations, and that it can create intimacy and help people feel more comfortable. He also talks about the importance of exhaustion, and how some negotiators intentionally try to wear down the other side to find resolution. However, he cautions that exhaustion should be used carefully as it can be damaging to the relationship between the parties involved.

01:30:00
In this section, Chris Voss talks about how the use of the word "fair" can be both abused and used in negotiation. According to Voss, it is often used as a weapon to manipulate and knock people off their game, as it is used when people feel defensive and unable to come up with a legitimate reason to back up their cornered position. Moreover, Voss notes that the best way to take the negotiation forward and end it is to pivot to agreed implementation and actual steps, which can only be achieved with a focus on the discussion of the next steps.

01:35:00
In this section of the transcript, Chris Voss discusses the concept of manipulation in negotiation. He explains that manipulation is not about being genuine and honest in your intentions. In other words, manipulation occurs when one party tries to exploit or hurt the other. He further explains that lying is not an effective negotiation tactic as it destroys trust and can impact the long-term reputation of a negotiator. As for how to become a better negotiator, Voss recommends practicing small stake negotiations using basic tools such as labeling, mirroring, paraphrasing, and summarizing in regular interactions with people to gain a feel for reading someone's affect and improving negotiation skills.

01:40:00
In this section, Chris Voss, a former FBI hostage negotiator, explains his practice of labeling people's emotional states to de-escalate potentially tense situations. He gives an example of using the label "tough day" at an airport to relieve a worker's stress and another example of using it on a stranger in a TSA line. He advises practicing conversation techniques to sharpen emotional intelligence, including making sure you heard someone out. Chris also shares a conversation that made him feel great, where his colleague accurately labeled the essence of what he was saying about his family, and encourages people to learn from such memorable conversations.

01:45:00
In this section of the interview, Chris Voss, former FBI hostage negotiator, discusses the importance of empathy in negotiations and human interactions. Voss explains that all humans have the same basic desires and needs for understanding, connection, and satisfaction, and that empathizing with others allows us to pick up on similar phrases and experiences that resonate with us. He advises the host to continue on his journey towards empathy and curiosity, emphasizing that it is a lifelong process. They later discuss the 7-38-55 rule of communication and how it originated from Professor Albert Moravian's research, and how it has been extrapolated to refer to the meaning in communication.

01:50:00
In this section, Chris Voss discusses the importance of tone and body language in communication, even in writing. He shares a story about a conference call with Elon Musk where his words were joking, but the person on the other end didn't realize he was joking because they couldn't see his face. Voss also talks about the possibility of AI chatbots becoming better negotiators than humans, based on their natural ability to stay positive and be available 24/7, but notes that they are still deeply flawed in emotional intelligence.

01:55:00
the development of chatbots and AI systems, it's important to consider the need for them to exhibit human-like qualities such as the capacity to set boundaries and choose not to be negative. Chris Voss, a former FBI hostage negotiator, argues that negotiators have to have the capacity to be a bad person and choose not to be, but Lex Fridman offers an alternative perspective, suggesting that negotiators just need to have the capacity to set a boundary and stick to it. Regardless, the conversation highlights the complexities involved in negotiation and the potential limitations of AI systems in navigating these complexities. AI systems may be able to help us understand what makes humans effective at negotiation, but there may be certain aspects of the negotiation process that only messy, uncertain humans can handle.

02:00:00
In this section, Chris Voss discusses the role of conflict in decision-making and creativity. He believes that while tools like chatbot systems can handle a lot of decision making, there will always be a need for human interaction in the remaining percentage. Voss acknowledges that conflict and drama can be a desirable feature in our society, citing examples like the Beatles' fighting leading to some of their best music. He also believes that there will always be war in the world, due to negative beliefs that are instilled in people from a young age. Voss advises young people to stick to their values even when it costs them, as exemplified by his own commitment to protecting and defending the American people during his time in the FBI.

02:05:00
In this section, Chris Voss shares how he fell in love with negotiating while working for the suicide hotline. By clearing the clutter in the callers' heads and helping them find a purpose to live, he found that this process made a significant impact on another human being in a very short period of time. Chris acknowledges the emotional struggles people face that can lead to suicide, and while he has strong religious beliefs, he respects all religions and thinks that there is a purpose for his life. He is appreciative of the opportunity to live each day and try to make a difference by inspiring others.
