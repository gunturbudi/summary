In this section, the speaker gives an analogy between relationships and compounding interest, stating that once you've been in a good relationship with someone for a while, life becomes easier as you've built mutual trust. They then highlight that trust between co-founders is especially important, as it removes frictional mechanisms that often lead to failure in startups, and allows for easy scaling and decision-making. Additionally, the speaker emphasizes that most of the benefits of compounding come at the end, and it's better to have a few deep relationships that compound over time than a lot of non-compounding ones. Lastly, they stress the importance of thinking big, as it takes just as much effort to create a small business as it does to create a large business.
