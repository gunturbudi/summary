# Summary of David Deutsch: Knowledge Creation and The Human Race

Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=YyxepLfH1ZU

David Deutsch discusses the importance of knowledge creation, and argues that humans are the only known species with the ability to create new knowledge. He also discusses the potential dangers of artificial intelligence reaching a point where it can create new knowledge without the guidance of a human.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
David Deutsch discusses how humans are different and exceptional when it comes to creating knowledge, and how the Earth is not a hospitable, fragile Spaceship. He recommends beginning with the first three chapters of his book, "Beginning of Infinity."

00:05:00
David Deutsch argues that knowledge is the key to understanding the physical universe, and that humans are the only known species with the ability to create knowledge. He also points out that there are two forms of knowledge creation – evolutionary and human – and that evolutionary knowledge is limited in its range due to the fact that it can't foresee problems and create solutions. Deutsch argues that this is why there is no evidence of a Creator in the natural world - because evolution cannot create something that is not already possible through incremental steps.

David Deutsch argues that humans have what it takes to defeat viruses, and that knowledge creation is the key to this victory. He argues that new knowledge allows us to use new resources, and that the success of this effort is determined by our choices. If we make bad choices, it will be due to anti-rational memes, not environmental constraints.

00:15:00
David Deutsch discusses the concept of creativity, its importance to the human race, and how to encourage it. He also discusses the potential dangers of artificial intelligence reaching a point where it can create new knowledge without the guidance of a human, and the need for programs to exhibit disobedience in order to be considered "creative."

00:20:00
David Deutsch argues that even the cleverest programmer cannot predict what will happen when they explore the space of possible things, and that the only way to know for certain if something is happening is to observe it in the real world. He goes on to say that one of the marks of an intelligent being is the ability to create new knowledge, and that the only way to measure if a child is learning is to observe their behavior. Deutsch concludes the talk by saying that we should be raising children to be creative thinkers, not obedient students.

00:25:00
David Deutsch discusses the idea that knowledge creation is a difficult process, and that it's easy to get caught up in the cycle of improvement and creativity. He argues that a good explanation must be able to meet all of the criticisms that we currently have of it, and that it's difficult to come up with a new, better explanation.

00:30:00
David Deutsch discusses the hallmark of a good explanation, which is that it often makes narrow and risky predictions. He argues that this is proper not mine, and that the more precise and unexpected the prediction is, the more testable the explanation is.

00:35:00
David Deutsch discusses the importance of testing explanations, reach, and the difference between a computer that is "quantum" and a "quantum computer." He argues that most researchers in quantum computing subscribe to the Everett interpretation of non-locality.

00:40:00
David Deutsch discusses the theory of quantum mechanics, which states that the behavior of particles is not fixed and can change depending on the environment. He explains that the wave function, which describes the quantum state of a particle, is not a function on space and time, but on a higher dimensional space. Deutsch goes on to say that the conventional interpretations of quantum mechanics, which rely on hand-waving, are immediately scrapped when presented with more complicated cases.
