In this section, the importance of hard work in building a business is discussed. Hard work is no substitute for whom you work with and what you work on. Building a business requires picking the right area of work, recruiting the best people to work with, and finally, hard work. The right thing to work on, the right people to work with, and hard work make the three legs of a stool that supports building a successful business. Hard work does not mean working 80-120 hours a week. Instead, people's most effective way of working is to sprint as hard as they can while inspired, passionate, and mentally clear, rest, reassess, and then try again.
