In this section, Ravi Gupta, a partner at Sequoia, discusses the advice his father gave him when he started working. He was told not to have separate work and home personalities as it would tire him out and he wouldn't want to live two different lives. Gupta talks about working with people who seem like two different people - one at work and one outside work. He says that it's surprising to see them in a different environment and the difference in behavior can make people feel like they're not getting the real person. Gupta also talks about his teenage years, where he felt like he had to differentiate himself from his brother and how his parents' strong sense of what success looks like influenced him.

In this section, Ravi Gupta talks about his views on success and his approach to teaching his children about it. He explains how his parents, who were immigrants to America, had a narrower view of success and how he and his wife advocate for a broader definition of success with earned success at its core. Gupta admits that one thing that triggers him with his kids is whininess, which he associates with being a victim. He tries to avoid just reacting to this behavior by asking questions which get his kids to think and try to solve their problems themselves.

In this section, Sequoia Capital's Ravi Gupta shares a personal anecdote about the value of earned success versus simply being given rewards. While discussing his sons' soccer achievements and their emphasis on hard work and earning medals, Gupta cites the current trend of participation medals as missing the point of the value of a medal as a memory dividend. He argues that mistreating someone who has natural talent or has worked hard for their success in the name of equality is doing them a disservice and removes the value of an earned achievement. This trend towards false equality is not only present in sports but also permeates into the workplace and school systems.

He shares insights from KKR about thinking of three things that need to go right in order for an investment to be successful, and how he has applied this logic while working at Instacart and Sequoia. Gupta also emphasizes the challenge of restarting growth after it has stalled due to how it causes people to shift their focus towards optimizing current operations rather than creating something new. He explains how it is difficult to get people to change their behavior fundamentally and how innovation is challenging due to how quickly people adapt to new products and features.

00:35:00

Gupta advises leaders to spend a significant amount of time searching for those trajectory-changing individuals for the company. He also discusses the importance of spending enough time with loved ones and questioning the American mentality of moving away from one's family for their career.

However, he argues that children don't know when the good moments are coming, and it could be when they are just sitting on the couch with you. Gupta recommends spending a lot of time with young kids, even when it seems pointless, because those moments matter.

Gupta also talks about how companies misattribute their success with processes like compensation bands and leveling systems, when the real reason for success is having a product that people need and effectively charging a toll for it.

Additionally, they are honest about where their thinking is strong versus weak. Furthermore, they are adept at identifying whose advice they need for which topic and are not hesitant to disregard advice that is not useful to them.

Secondly, they consider concepts like decision fatigue and structure their day to make two or three good decisions. Thirdly, they know how to efficiently obtain all available information by asking the right questions, making decisions in the face of uncertainty.

He emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and how one can use a framework to predict how someone will behave in a given situation.

01:35:00
In this section, Ravi Gupta of Sequoia discusses two factors that he thinks contribute to self-sabotage: the belief that something is beneath you and a desire to be loved rather than respected. He explains the importance of being respected as a leader by making decisions that are in the best interest of the company in the long-term. Gupta uses an example from his own life of how his parents treated him and his brother differently, based on their individual strengths and weaknesses, which helped them reach their full potential.

He ends the interview by stating that success, both personally and professionally, means giving everything to the people that matter most and having a positive impact on their lives.
