Adam Robinson, a successful investor and author of "The Great Game of Life," discusses various topics in the Knowledge Project Podcast. He emphasizes that life is a game, and offers suggestions on how to play this game to win. Robinson also discusses the current loneliness epidemic which has been accelerated by technology, and suggests that the key to happiness is to engage fully in life and direct our attention away from ourselves. He also offers insights on approaches to investing, cautioning against trying to compete with Wall Street professionals and instead focusing on anticipating the anticipation of others' views of the future. Robinson's ultimate message is that life is a great game, and the key to winning is by being fully present, playing to win-win outcomes, giving joy to others, and embracing the unexpected.
On the Knowledge Project Podcast, Adam Robinson outlines various key concepts that can help individuals win the game of life. Robinson notes that being patient when investing in stocks or assets is essential, and he emphasizes the importance of following the metal traders as they are often the most far-sighted and accurate. Furthermore, Robinson encourages individuals to develop a process that is repeatable and testable, an approach he applied successfully in his algorithms developed for test-taking. Robinson argues for the importance of persistence, experimentation, and detachment in learning and highlights a male-female difference in test-taking, with girls tending to be more prepared but less likely to expect to fail, which can cause them to perform worse on standardized tests.

Detail Summary:

In this section, Adam Robinson explains that the Great Game of Life is the title of his upcoming book and he believes that everything in life is a game, including democracy and capitalism. He says that games are competitive and intense, but the Great Game is a win-win game that he hopes to offer as a beacon, an alternative to the win-lose games that have played themselves out. Robinson also recalls his appearance on a live podcast with Tim Ferriss, Josh Waitzkin, and Ramit Sethi, in which he spontaneously listed three things he learned that year, including the importance of connecting with others, creating fun, and light for others, and being resilient.

00:05:00
In this section, Adam Robinson discusses the concept of leaning into each moment and every encounter expecting magic or miracles. He also talks about his book, "The Great Game of Life," which is meant to be a doing book that changes the way readers see and interpret the world. Robinson emphasizes the importance of creating a vision for others to join, whether it be starting a business or a relationship, that offers a possible future that others want to be a part of. He expresses concern about the current lack of positive visions and the rising anger level in the world, attributing it to a global loneliness epidemic that is hugely accelerated by technology.

00:10:00
In this section, Robinson discusses how technology has hijacked attention and created a world where our views of the world are reflected back to us. The internet and technology have become a confirmation bias engine that presents what we like and what we don't like to get us to respond and heighten emotions. This has resulted in an epidemic of loneliness in the US, demonstrated by the top five results when Robinson searched "how can I learn" on Google. Number five was "how can I learn to love myself?" suggesting that lots of people are struggling with self-love and need help with it.

00:15:00
In this section, Adam Robinson, the guest on the Knowledge Project Podcast, discusses the epidemic of loneliness and the fact that a Google search of "How can I learn" yields "to love myself" as the third autofill option. This points to the immense problem of people not knowing how to learn to love themselves, and the loneliness epidemic that is currently happening. Robinson argues that the key to happiness is to be fully engaged in your life and to redirect your attention away from yourself to others or the task at hand. He also criticizes self-help books for riveting attention on oneself, instead of others or the task at hand, which can contribute to negative feelings of doubt, frustration, and loneliness.

00:20:00
In this section, Adam Robinson discusses how he came to the realization that the key to finding oneself is through others, and how this revelation has changed his perspective on life. He emphasizes the importance of connecting with others, creating fun and delight, and leaning into every moment with a sense of excitement and expectation of magic. Robinson also suggests that asking questions like "how can I create fun and delight for this person right now?" or "how can I bring more play into this situation?" can lead to a more enjoyable and rewarding life.

00:25:00
In this section, Adam Robinson discusses how approaching job interviews as a game where the objective is to create fun and delight for the interviewer can greatly enhance the likelihood of being hired. Robinson suggests focusing more on who you need to be in a situation rather than what you need to do. He emphasizes the importance of having a vision for yourself and the world to determine what practical steps to take to accomplish goals. Robinson also discusses Einstein's idea that changing the world requires changing the thinking behind it and identifies some practical steps to achieve this, including changing the questions asked and providing inspired answers.

00:30:00
In this section, Adam Robinson reflects on the human condition and the pursuit of happiness in modern civilization. He argues that our sense of separation creates fear, isolation, and anger, leading to the pursuit of happiness as an escape from pain. However, he contends that embracing pain and accepting it is the way to freedom. Robinson also addresses the role of thinking in achieving greater insights, arguing that logical thinking only takes us so far and that the greatest insights come spontaneously out of the blue from our unconscious.

00:35:00
In this section, Adam Robinson discusses the importance of allowing oneself some time to tap into their unconscious in order to listen to their inner voice. He suggests that a clue that you have tapped into truth with a capital T and that your unconscious is speaking is that the answer will surprise you, and this is a good thing because surprise indicates that your model of the world is incorrect, which means that it is a learning opportunity. Robinson believes that the power of things that don't make sense is a great tool for finding opportunities, including those in investing or politics, because it is often indicators of people being on the wrong side of a trade or a belief.

00:40:00
In this section, Adam Robinson dismisses the idea of intrinsic value coined by Benjamin Graham, who invented the most common form of investment approach called fundamental analysis which was based on intrinsic value. He points out that there is no such thing as true value, and that the fundamental premise of fundamental analysis that there is a true value that human beings drive the price away from, is false. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger use the fundamental analysis algorithm but their approach is different, compared to most people who invest in stock, they buy a company and intend to hold it forever.

00:45:00
In this section, Adam Robinson discusses different approaches to investing and the flaws in fundamental and technical analysis. He highlights that fundamental analysts believe that they can discover something unique and connect information differently from everyone else, but this hubris is flawed as everyone uses the same tools and information. Similarly, the reliability of technical analysis is questionable, as there is no statistical proof showing that it works. Robinson suggests that another way to invest successfully is by anticipating the anticipation of others, rather than attempting to determine the true value or price of a particular asset.

00:50:00
In this section, Adam Robinson discusses his approach to markets and investing by waiting for different groups of investors to express different views of the future and figuring out which group is right. He looks for strongly expressed differences of opinion and decides which one is right. Robinson compares investing to the expression of a view of the future and market trends to the spread of an idea. Although he appreciates Peter Lynch's book, "One Up on Wall Street," he expresses his concern that it gives a false sense of beating professionals at their own game.

00:55:00
In this section, Adam Robinson, a successful investor, warns against how-to books that invite the public to compete with Wall Street professionals, emphasizing that investing is a gladiatorial pit, and if you aren't a professional investor or don't have an edge, you will be the patsy. Robinson emphasizes that all ideas pass through various stages, including early adopters, majority, late majority, and laggards, and suggests that there are three ways a trend can begin, the first being that the stock is rising, the second being the stock has just declined rapidly, and the third being an idea that's beginning to spread. Robinson, with many years of studying markets, reveals that certain farsighted individuals will realize the trend's future and exit their longs to massively short, leading to a sudden drop in the stock price.

01:00:00
In this section, Adam Robinson explains the three ways that price trends change in the stock market: a sudden decline followed by a retracement, a decline from a parabolic move, and a protracted period of nothing going on. He states that a sudden decline followed by a retracement is usually due to far-sighted individuals who massively short the stock, let it decline sharply, and then let everyone else buy it back up before shorting it again. The other two ways the price trend changes are due to long periods of strong opinion formation or a change in the stock's ownership. Robinson emphasizes the importance of being patient in the stock market and only investing in stocks with a strong conviction.

01:05:00
In this section, Adam Robinson explains the three ways an asset or stock can operate in the market - a long-term uptrend or downtrend, a parabolic trend, and finally, an asset that remains flat for an extended period of time. In the latter case, although it appears that nothing is happening, the asset is actually being accumulated by individuals with patience and conviction. Different groups of traders express their views of the future using various assets or stocks. Robinson believes that 99 times out of 100, bond traders are right, and early in expressing their pessimism about the economy, compared to stock traders who express optimism. Lastly, Robinson reveals that the smartest group to follow is the dumbest because they are the bond traders who are right but early.

01:10:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the different types of traders and how their views on the world affect their investment strategies. He believes that metal traders are the most far-sighted and accurate traders in the market because their view of the world is very simplistic, they are in touch with reality, and they look at the market from a long-term perspective. In contrast, Central Bankers and economists have complex and often inaccurate models of the economy, making them the least reliable traders. He ranked Equity traders in third place, Bond traders in second, and Metal traders in first, followed by oil and currency traders.

01:15:00
In this section, Adam Robinson discusses how traders use the price of copper divided by the price of gold to express their view of interest rates. According to Robinson, metal traders have not been wrong once in the last 18 years about the direction of interest rates, either to the upside or the downside. Currently, metal traders believe that interest rates should be near one-year lows but they are actually at one-year highs. Robinson states that when metal traders and bond traders disagree about the direction of interest rates, the metal traders are usually right. Robinson also discusses how oil is a difficult commodity to predict due to the fact that it is traded by sovereign nations who also control the supply. To have an edge in investing, Robinson suggests having a definable and repeatable process, which involves creating formal rules around a certain process to improve oneself.

01:20:00
In this section, Robinson emphasizes the need for a repeatable process in investing and the importance of testing everything. He explains that having a process that can be articulated and improved upon is crucial for success, and that relying solely on gut instinct is not reliable or helpful. Robinson discusses John Maynard Keynes' strategy for anticipating the anticipation of others through the expression of different groups of people and their bets, and stresses the importance of understanding the expressions of ideas in trading. Robinson then shifts to discussing his experience with tutoring students for the SAT and how he developed a method for approaching the test through the arrangement of questions in order of difficulty.

01:25:00
In this section, Adam Robinson discusses his algorithms for test-taking, specifically for the SAT test. He noticed patterns in the test-taking process and realized that the harder the questions were, the less likely a person would choose the correct answer based on their initial instinct. He created a system where students would ask themselves what Joe Blox, a mythical character, would do and then do the opposite for hard questions. He also noticed that there were only a few hundred vocabulary words that were commonly used on the test and that students could reverse engineer the answer to an analogy question even if they didn't know the words' meanings. Robinson's system was a response to the standardized testing system, and it achieved great results in getting students to achieve higher scores.

01:30:00
In this section, Adam Robinson discusses his experience using big data to improve scores for students using a computer program in the early 1980s. The program tracked the results of each student and their choices to measure which techniques users weren't using that had been taught. They also used collective feedback to measure a teacher's effectiveness, while data was used to pinpoint areas of improvement for the resource manager as well. While Robinson believes that a Core Curriculum should be implemented in reading, writing, and math, experimentation has been challenging due to the lack of conformity in the US education system, as each teacher can do what they deem right. Furthermore, Robinson discussed his research from 25 years ago, which found that 80% of the variation in fifth-grade math and reading scores in New York City Schools at that time was attributable to the socioeconomic standing of the school, not the teachers.

01:35:00
In this section, Robinson discusses his experience working with the Board of Ed to develop a program to prepare inner city kids for specialized high school admissions, with a goal of boosting minority enrollment. He collected data from students answering questions on factors like age, family background, and psychological factors, and found that students with a father born in another country and a mother born in the United States improved twice as much as the reverse. This factor superseded race, with students of different races improving at the same rates if they met this demographic criterion. This is because the father, as an immigrant, instills the immigrant drive, whereas the mother passes on language skills.

01:40:00
In this section, Adam Robinson discusses the importance of improvement and how it is inversely related to the perceived chances of success. He explains that one desired characteristic of students in a program is a kid who thinks they are not going to pass the test and believes they can improve with the help of someone who believes in them. Robinson believes that the real takeaway lesson is not the test score but rather the life lesson that one can improve with hard work and application. He stresses the importance of not deifying intelligence, rather focusing on hard work and that learning is hard. Parents can instill the idea of struggling and persisting to succeed rather than giving up by modeling that behavior to their children as children today don't see that behavior modeled anywhere.

01:45:00
In this section, Adam Robinson discusses the importance of modeling persistence and staying with something in order to succeed. He notes that this is a crucial skill that parents should model for their children, as it is not something that is taught in schools. Robinson argues that the education system does not allow students to think and figure things out at their own pace. Instead, they are expected to provide quick answers, and if they cannot do so, they are made to feel bad. Robinson encourages people to adopt a detached and experimental approach, as this enables them to see what is effective and what does not work. He uses stand-up comedians as an example, as they experiment with their routines to see what works and what doesn’t. Robinson concludes that individuals need to be more detached, experimental, and scientific about their learning and approach to life.

01:50:00
In this section, Adam Robinson discusses the importance of experimenting and trying out different approaches in order to find success, using the example of three kids asking for donations on the street. He encourages individuals to change what they're doing if they're not getting the results that they want and explains that a step in the opposite direction is usually a good starting point. Robinson also points out the problems with the education system, which often encourages rote learning to pass tests instead of really learning and applying the material. He uses the LSAT and GMAT tests as examples of how even the tests themselves can select for particular skills or mindsets.

01:55:00
In this section, Adam Robinson discusses the male-female difference in test-taking and how boys tend to outscore girls on both the math and verbal sections of standardized tests. He explains that most women in school are more conscientious than most men, resulting in them feeling more prepared for the test. However, most standardized tests are designed to make you fail, and boys who tend to be more unprepared than girls tend to do better on standardized tests precisely because they expect to fail, whereas girls expect to pass.
