In this section, Danny Meyer explains his journey into the restaurant industry and how he realized that he wasn't cut out to be a chef due to his interest in various aspects of the business. He also shares his approach to selecting restaurant locations, which involves understanding the "terroir" of the space and what the location is saying in terms of accessibility, surrounding environment, and potential for success. He compares this process to that of a winemaker selecting a vineyard and committing to grape growth for at least 10 years. However, he notes that many restaurant spaces do not make suitable locations and should not be forced into becoming a restaurant.

In this section, Danny Meyer draws a comparison between running a successful business and the art of winemaking. He believes that, like a winemaker selecting the best vineyard site with the best grapes, a business owner should select the best location with employees that fit the culture they want to create. His company starts the process of culture building from day one by selecting people who align with their values and who they believe will thrive in their culture. A positive, welcoming culture is key to the hospitality business, and something that Meyer strives for in all his restaurants. He defines hospitality as existing when both parties in a transaction trust that the other is on their side.

In this section, Danny Meyer emphasizes the importance of treating employees with hospitality to create a positive culture in the workplace. When employees feel supported and part of a winning team, they will perform better and provide great customer service, which will lead to customer loyalty, community support, and better relationships with suppliers. Meyer also explains that the key to growing culture and hospitality lies in creating a language that clarifies the company's intentions and creates a sense of belonging among employees.

In this section, Shake Shack founder Danny Meyer discusses the importance of building and evolving company culture. Meyer notes that company culture must change as organizations grow, with values serving as the compass to guide the evolution. Meyer cites the difficulties of scaling culture but identifies the six emotional skills vital to maintaining culture carriers: kindness, positivity, empathy, work ethic, intellectual curiosity, and integrity. These skills become more critical as organizations promote from within since that sets the standard to which other team members aspire.

00:20:00
In this section, Shake Shack founder Danny Meyer describes the six emotional skills that are crucial for having a high "hospitality quotient". First, he looks for optimistic kindness, which means that the person appears to have kind eyes and is optimistic about their actions making the world a better place. Secondly, intellectual curiosity is key, and he wants to see people continuously learning and adapting. The third and fourth skills are self-explanatory; having a strong work ethic and empathy respectively. Fifth, self-awareness involves understanding your emotions and drives on a personal level. Finally, he looks for integrity, meaning that the person has strong moral character and the ability to inspire trust.

In this section, Danny Meyer talks about the importance of understanding your personal "weather report" as a member of a team, which is your state of mind, energy level, and overall disposition. He says that it's crucial to know how you're feeling because it can affect other people on the team. Meyer also discusses the six emotional skills he looks for when hiring, which include work ethic, empathy, integrity, optimism, curiosity, and friendliness. He believes that these skills can't necessarily be taught but can be identified, celebrated, and purposefully hired for. Meyer also introduces the concept of hospitality quotient (HQ), which measures a person's ability to make others happy through their work. He notes that not everyone has a high HQ, but it's an essential quality for those who work in hospitality.

00:30:00
In this section, Danny Meyer discusses the importance of making people feel good, which can differentiate different organizations and teams. However, scaling this feeling is the trickiest part, compared to scaling your product or service. Meyer also admits that he struggles with removing people who don't have a high HQ but has learned to identify them through the company culture. He aims for self-awareness and avoids creating a cult-like company that excludes people who don't share the same ideals. A helpful tool is a four-quadrant chart that helps manage emotions and take a good look at some decisions made. For example, if someone can but won't, they must be confronted, according to Meyer.

In this section, Danny Meyer talks about dealing with difficult employees and the timelines he follows when addressing the issue. For employees who can, but won't change their behavior, Meyer puts a fire under their "rear end" to spur action within 90 days. Meanwhile, employees who can't improve within a month are likely unsuccessful hires overall. But for employees who can improve and have a cultural fit, Meyer is willing to give them up to 120 days to improve. Meyer discusses his approach to scaling, noting that he finds both bricklaying and masonry appealing for different reasons. He cites Shake Shack as an example of scaling with a uniform and repeatable process (like bricklaying) across many locations while he sees smaller restaurants often as a masonry approach that allows for more character and personality from employees. Meyer believes these different approaches can help restaurants create something unique or something repeatable and efficient, and admires both styles of building.

In this section, Danny Meyer, founder of Shake Shack, talks about his experience bringing one of his restaurants to Tokyo and how he was asked by Taka Takasan, the owner of a company with multiple restaurant units, to teach them how to improvise in hospitality like they do in America. Takasan said that they can cook a recipe, play music, or provide service just as well as Americans, but they lack the ability to improvise and customize the experience for each guest, which is what American hospitality does well. Meyer explains that a true hospitality experience begins with a standard off-the-shelf experience that is regimented but the thrill comes from customizing the experience for each guest, which requires masons and bricklayers both in the restaurant industry.

In this section, Danny Meyer explains that Shake Shack's success can be attributed to its unique mix of fine dining and fast food. While many in the Shake Shack team came from high-end restaurants, they learned how to scale the business and apply their philosophy to fast food. Meyer was careful about expanding the business and opening a second restaurant after learning from his father's bankruptcies. After therapy, he realized that not every business that scaled went bankrupt and that he was not his father. This helped him take the risk of expanding Shake Shack.

00:50:00
In this section, Danny Meyer, the founder of Shake Shack, discusses the importance of hiring people who compensate for one's weaknesses and support their strengths. He explains how his father's failure was due to not surrounding himself with enough talent. Meyer explains that it is essential to understand both one's strengths and weaknesses, follow compensatory hiring, and make a great work environment for talented people. Further, he emphasizes that educating the public about the underpaid people in the restaurant industry is crucial. Meyer believes that the biggest failure of the industry is not educating the public that they are a people business and have been underpaying people for many years.

00:55:00
In this section, Shake Shack founder Danny Meyer argues that the restaurant industry needs to pay a fair living wage to its workers to be sustainable in the long-term. As cities, states, and countries move towards a higher minimum wage, Meyer notes that customers will see higher menu prices, which he believes is necessary for the industry to thrive. He argues that the industry cannot be good at providing first jobs while failing to promote people to a role with a decent wage. Meyers also highlights the need to learn from mistakes, noting the five "A's" of mistake-making: be aware, acknowledge, apologize, act, and apply.

01:00:00
In this section, Danny Meyer discusses his philosophy on how to handle mistakes as a business owner or leader. He outlines five steps: acknowledge the mistake, apologize genuinely, act on it to fix it, apply additional generosity, and turn the mistake into a positive outcome. Meyer believes that mistakes are not what does a person or business in, but rather how they handle them. He also emphasizes that mistakes of integrity are a different matter and should not be forgiven.
