She compares scaling to the joy of high growth and believes that one of the key leverage points is hiring t-shaped leaders who contribute to multiple areas of the business.

Sarah talks about how the experience has changed her perspective and priorities, allowing her to appreciate the simple things and to focus more on what she loves about work.

In this section, Sarah Jones Simmer, speaker and coach, discusses the importance of reflecting and setting boundaries, particularly in an online world where it's challenging to signal the beginning and end of the day. She shares that behavior change is challenging, but technology can be leveraged positively to reinforce changes, for example, through streaks or by finding a cohort to hold each other accountable. Sarah believes that people should "hack their own behavior changes" and prioritize activities that bring joy, even if it means taking time away from work. She notes that time spent on self-care ultimately drives towards healthier outcomes and makes individuals more effective in their work.

In this section, Sarah Jones Simmer talks about her current role in the company called Found, which takes a platform approach to tackle the issue of weight care and weight loss. The platform combines coaching, a community, and a mobile app, as well as FDA-approved medication prescribed by a clinician. Jones Simmer emphasizes that this is a multi-factorial issue and that the industry narrative of eat less, exercise more, which often creates a culture of shame, is wrong. She mentions that the company and its focus on self-acceptance and empowerment seems to be resonating with investors, as the company raised a series B, which was meaningfully oversubscribed. Investors see the clear product-market fit, which aims to bring differentiated medication to the table while staying centered around lifestyle change.

In this section, Sarah Jones Simmer talks about her experience as a woman founder in the startup world and the biases and challenges that come with it. Despite her health challenges, she was pleased that investors bought into what she was building and her ability to help solve the problem. She has reinforced the practice of "working with" instead of "working for" people and believes that collaboration and having voices heard are some of the wonderful qualities of working with women. She emphasizes the importance of a commitment to the mission and having curiosity when it comes to hiring people for scaling. Jones Simmer also believes in building a bigger table in order to bring diverse perspectives to the table and generate better outcomes for the business.

In this section, Sarah Jones Simmer talks about the importance of intellectual curiosity and kindness in potential hires. She discusses how she appreciates interviewees who come with a list of suggestions on things they can change in the onboarding process as well as those who are passionate about the mission. Furthermore, she believes that versatility and curiosity are critical traits in leaders, especially in the early days of a company's growth. She also shares her experiences with identifying her and her sister's sweet spots and how self-reflection and self-awareness are important in identifying one's strengths. Lastly, she emphasizes that kindness is an essential trait, saying that people who are kind are those who provide constructive feedback that sets others up for success, and that setting an example is key in the interview process.

In this section, Sarah Jones Simmer discusses the importance of values fit in hiring and assessing candidates, emphasizing the need to look for those who live out their values in their day-to-day actions. She also explores the concept of kindness versus niceness in the workplace, with the former being the willingness to push back and provide feedback to help sharpen ideas, while the latter involves saying what others want to hear. Creating psychological safety is key to fostering an environment where people feel comfortable enough to provide feedback, and this starts with providing them with a sense of stability and solid ground to stand on. While remote work has become more common, establishing trust with individuals online is more difficult than continuing trust with someone you have an existing relationship with in person. Hence, intentional efforts, such as periodic in-person engagement and demonstrating vulnerability and authenticity as a leader, can help build trust and foster psychological safety in remote work settings.

Simmer emphasizes the positive effects of phone calls and long walks to help clear one's mind and engage in deeper introspection, which can lead to better problem-solving and decision-making. She stresses the need to intentionally carve out time for deep thinking, especially in a remote-first context, and recognizing the value of longer contemplation periods.

00:50:00
In this section, Sarah Jones Simmer shares her approach to decision-making, which involves a bias for slower decision-making with conviction, as opposed to making quick decisions. She emphasizes the importance of listening and gathering information, as throwing out an opinion too soon may lead people to gravitate towards that opinion instead of coming up with their best solutions. She also explains that it is not her job to know everything about everything, but rather to hire amazing people who can fill in the gaps and to be able to ask the right questions. Finally, she discusses how having a coach helps her navigate areas outside of her understanding and build trust with her team, ultimately leading to agility and growth in the business.

00:55:00
In this section, Sarah Jones Simmer discusses the stigma surrounding the use of coaches and how it should not exist. She emphasizes the benefits of having a coach, particularly as a safe space to explore ideas and vent upwards. She also compares having a professional coach to strength training, where the coach pushes you to achieve things you may not have been able to do on your own, and provides you with different frameworks for thinking about things. However, she notes that despite having online platforms, it can be challenging to find safe spaces to say things without fear of backlash or be able to reflect on oneself without creating mistrust. Sarah also shares her definition of success, which is finding joy and knowing love in life.
