In this section, Maria Konnikova explains how her life led her to become a professional poker player and the concept of chance in her life. She talks about her grandmother's sudden death, her own health issues and being uncertain about its cause, and her husband and mother losing their jobs. These events made her realize the role that chance plays in our lives and the things we take for granted, including our health and success. It led her to appreciate the randomness of life and how it can unexpectedly lead to opportunities we never thought possible.

00:05:00
In this section, author and journalist Maria Konnikova explains how she became interested in the role of chance in life and how her research led her to John Von Neumann's book, "The Theory of Games". Konnikova found that Von Neumann created game theory with his love for poker, which he believed was the perfect game of incomplete information; Von Neumann also believed that he could sell poker to create a rubric for solving the most complex strategic decisions in the world, including preventing nuclear war. Konnikova was inspired to immerse herself in the world of poker and use it as a way to explore the themes of chance and skill in her next book.

00:10:00
In this section, Maria Konnikova explains how playing poker can be a valuable decision-making tool and teaching tool because it teaches you to deal with uncertainty within a controlled environment. She compares it to investing in the stock market, which is much noisier, and notes that in poker, you have a clear goal and clear evidence of whether you're doing poorly. This makes it difficult to deflect blame onto outside factors and forces you to question your own decision-making process. Konnikova also discusses how she chose Eric Seidel as her mentor and coach for her poker project, citing his longevity and success as a poker player.

00:15:00
In this section, Maria Konnikova discusses how she chose Eric Seidel as her poker coach and what qualities she was looking for. Rather than someone with a brash personality, she wanted a private individual who would be willing to teach her with patience and understanding. Konnikova also highlights two approaches to poker: the mathematical and the psychological. Being from a psychology background, she emphasized the psychological approach, and Eric Seidel followed that as well. She reached out to him and arranged to meet for breakfast, where she would pitch her idea of being his student.

00:20:00
In this section of the video, Maria Konnikova explains how she approached the world-renowned poker player, Eric Seidel, to coach her despite having no experience in poker. She explains to Eric that she is a psychologist and writer and believes in his views on longevity and the psychological aspects of decision-making. Eric was intrigued by Maria's background and her clean slate, which is uncommon in the poker world, and was interested in her studies on self-control, hot, and cool decision-making, and risk-taking, which he believed was perfect for poker. Moreover, Maria's writing style and experience in writing for a general audience was a bonus for Eric, who wanted to legitimize the beauty of the game and remove the misconceptions surrounding it. Eric didn't agree to be Maria's coach right away but decided to try it out since their minds kind of thought in similar ways, and it worked, beginning a successful partnership.

00:25:00
In this section, Konnikova talks about how her coach, Eric, did not have a lesson plan when she first started learning poker, as he had never taught anyone before. Instead, he recommended that she read Dan Harrington's books on poker and make a list of questions that he could help her with. Konnikova actively read and reread the books and asked questions to Eric as they went along. Additionally, Eric helped her connect with professionals who specialized in the areas she needed help with, demonstrating his lack of ego and how he prioritizes his students' learning over his own reputation as a coach.

00:30:00
In this section, Maria Konnikova discusses her evolution as a poker player and how online poker allowed her to gain experience quickly and record herself playing, which provided a valuable tool for her mentor Eric to teach her about her thought process. Eric never prescribed what she should do but instead asked her to explain her thought process, which forced her to reflect on her decision-making. This led her to realize that it was more important to have a solid thought process than to focus solely on the outcome. She recommends having a coach or mentor when starting because they provide personalized feedback crucial in enabling improvement. Konnikova also credits her mentorship in helping her become a more thoughtful player, which eventually transferred outside of poker to various areas of her life.

00:35:00
In this section, Maria Konnikova discusses the importance of having mentors and verbalizing the thought process in becoming a good thinker, writer, and poker player. She also highlights the role of betting in improving one's decision-making process, as proposed by Kant in his Critique of Pure Reason. Betting makes people stop to reflect on their level of certainty and the assumptions they make. This could have a significant impact on the internet and social media where everyone is an expert on everything and amplifies their opinions. A mechanism where people bet on the correctness of their statements could lead to more reflective communication.

00:40:00
In this section, Maria Konnikova discusses how playing poker helped her become more self-aware and her own fact-checker. She mentions how she needed to rethink her overconfidence and tendency to exaggerate in order to improve her game. She also clarifies the importance of intuition but highlights the need for experience and a basis for such gut feelings before relying on them. Lastly, she talks about the continuum between rational and emotional thinking and how she believes emotions are inevitable in decision-making, citing Sherlock Holmes as an example of someone who acknowledges and experiences emotions despite being viewed as a cold and calculated character.

00:45:00
In this section, Maria Konnikova discusses how emotions can influence decision making, using examples from poker and psychology. She explains that emotions are not always negative and can be integral to the decision-making process. However, irrelevant emotions, referred to as "tilt," can affect rational thought processes and lead to poor decision making. Konnikova emphasizes the importance of being mindful of one's emotions, identifying them, and distinguishing between those that are relevant and irrelevant to the decision at hand. The goal is to cool down hot processes and learn self-control to make the correct decision.

00:50:00
In this section, Maria Konnikova discusses the process of identifying emotions, taking corrective action, and learning to control them. She emphasizes that identifying emotions is a long process that requires practice, reflection and being mindful. She compares it to Sherlock Holmes' approach to mindfulness and observation. Even though Konnikova is well-versed in controlling her emotions, she admits that she still tilts from time to time. She explains that emotions are individual triggers and that you need to be aware of how they will affect you in situations. Lastly, Konnikova explains how her mental game coach, Jared Tendler, helped her identify her triggers and how to take corrective action.

00:55:00
In this section, Maria Konnikova shares some of the triggers she experiences at poker tables, and how she learned to reflect better. She discusses how she initially didn't realize how gender stereotypes were impacting her decisions until Jared helped her identify specific triggers that she was responding to. She talks about the importance of taking a pause from life and making reflection a regular part of your day, something she previously didn't do until she started using techniques of mindfulness and meditation to reflect on her own thought process.

01:00:00
In this section of the interview, author Maria Konnikova discusses the importance of taking moments for reflection in order to make better decisions in the future. She explains how she learned to take breaks from tournaments and not do anything, as well as the benefits of doing daily check-ins and reflections about what you're thinking and how you're doing. By taking these moments for reflection, Konnikova believes that people can become better decision-makers, better-regulated emotionally and more in touch with themselves. When reflecting, she suggests considering the emotional elements of a situation, the people involved, the stakes, and the big picture goals to gain perspective and solve problems more efficiently.

01:05:00
In this section, Maria Konnikova shares how she rediscovered the Sherlock Holmes stories and how they inspired her to write her first book. While working on an article about mindfulness, she remembered a scene from the stories where Holmes asks Watson how many steps lead up to their apartment and uses it to illustrate the difference between seeing and observing. This led her to reread all of the stories and realize how they contain a wealth of insight on topics such as creativity, rational thinking, and observation. She discusses how the stories challenge the perception of Holmes as a hyper-rational decision-making guru and reveal his impressive creativity and ability to take non-linear leaps in his thought process. She cites the "three pipe problem" from "The Adventures of the Redheaded League" as an example of how Holmes used reflection and stepping back to solve problems rather than immediately jumping in.

01:10:00
In this section, Maria Konnikova, author of the book "The Biggest Bluff," discusses how her study of Sherlock Holmes helped her develop her thinking and how playing poker is an excellent way to teach and test one's cognitive abilities. She highlights that any given hand can result in winners and losers, but skill emerges triumphant over the long term, provided luck does not ruin the chance to see your potential. This realization makes people less judgmental since they realize how much of life's achievements are due to luck. She suggests that testing one's thought processes through honest reflection and exposing them to experienced people is critical to improvement, much like her teacher helped her improve at poker.

01:15:00
In this section, Maria Konnikova discusses how her mentor in poker taught her to examine her thought process to become a better player instead of just prescribing specific moves for certain situations. By focusing on why she should make certain moves and what factors to consider, she developed a deeper understanding and ultimately became a better player. She also touches on the importance of having an active mindset in life and taking responsibility for our actions instead of feeling like life is just happening to us.

01:20:00
In this section, Maria Konnikova discusses the danger of seeking only for answers and not reflecting on one's experiences. She notes that people tend to want the recipe for success in life, but this approach can lead to the illusion of knowledge and overconfidence. Additionally, she cites Eric's lesson to have less certainty and more inquiry as a way to avoid unwarranted risks and make adjustments to changing circumstances. This mindset is particularly relevant in poker games where players need to inquire, ask questions, and think through things for themselves, instead of blindly following theoretical models. Konnikova also highlights the difficulty of adjustment for people who lack humility and the willingness to embrace change in any realm of life.

01:25:00
In this section, Maria Konnikova discusses some of her reading habits and how she filters what she reads. She believes that everyone should be reading fiction and poetry and that these genres have different lessons to teach us. Konnikova filters her reading by taking recommendations from people she admires and also by reading the Paris Review interviews, which often include book recommendations from writers and thinkers. She also feels very free to put books down if she isn't enjoying them. When reading non-fiction, she underlines and writes in the margins; however, for fiction, she only writes in the book if she wants to engage with it more deeply.

01:30:00
In this section, Maria Konnikova talks about the benefits of active reading and taking notes or making marks in books. She explains that these practices enable the reader to process information more deeply and to revisit their past selves by seeing how their thoughts have changed over time. Konnikova believes that active reading helps with retaining knowledge and makes the learning experience more powerful. She also acknowledges that it's not always possible to read actively and that some books may have gotten away from her because of that.
