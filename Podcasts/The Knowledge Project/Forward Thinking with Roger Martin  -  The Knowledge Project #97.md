Roger Martin, an expert in integrative thinking, believes that education has failed to teach students how to think and that business education is not helpful to the world because it only benefits a small percentage of people who can think integratively. He suggests that integrative thinking can be taught at a much earlier level and shares a four-step methodology. Martin argues that the world would benefit from more integrative thinking rather than limiting perspectives to either-or thinking, and that education often leads to narrow thinking and specialization, resulting in blindness to important details. Additionally, he discusses the fallacy of identifying jobs without considering whether it is feasible for someone to actually do the job and the importance of great leaders having the core characteristic of inviting feedback and wanting to understand why others disagree with their perspective.
In this episode of The Knowledge Project, Roger Martin, former dean of the Rotman School, discusses his experiences developing a new economic model for the school, identifies common patterns of failure, explains the importance of having a good strategy, and shares insights into how to make creative decisions and gather feedback. Martin stresses the value of being strategic in one's thinking, developing a cohesive set of actions to achieve desired goals, and seeking out diverse perspectives and data to make informed decisions. He concludes by expressing his desire to be remembered as a voice that will be missed.

Detail Summary:

In this section, Roger Martin discusses how he learned the power of thinking through osmosis and how the education system has failed to teach students how to think. He cites the abdication of teaching fundamental problems of business and connecting them as one of the biggest problems of business and education today. Martin believes that a daunting task for teaching people to think better is to show that everything in the world is connected to everything else, but with business education's failure, it's currently a critical impediment to that.

In this section, Roger Martin, an expert in integrative thinking, shares his perspective on business education and its limitations. He believes that business education is not helpful to the world because it only benefits a small percentage of people who can think integratively, a skill that they have acquired prior to attending business school. Martin introduced the concept of integrative thinking to business education but realized that it can be taught at a much earlier level. He tested this theory on grade 10 girls from an all-girls high school called Branson Hall and found that their ability to come up with integrative answers was just as good as MBA students. He also shared a four-step methodology for teaching integrative thinking to younger students. It starts with the notion of understanding either-or choices and then evolves into thinking of creative solutions.

00:10:00
In this section, Roger Martin shares his approach to integrative thinking and how it can lead to innovative solutions by looking at extreme examples. He uses the Toronto International Film Festival as an example of two models of running a film festival: the inclusive community-oriented festival and the exclusive Cannes-like festival. Martin suggests analyzing each model and identifying what features people love the most, followed by integrative moves to create new solutions. For instance, the TIFF's organizers created the people's choice award as a way to generate buzz and increased inclusivity, making it the most important film festival in the world. Martin believes that the world would benefit from more integrative thinking rather than limiting perspectives to either-or thinking.

00:15:00
In this section, Roger Martin discusses the lack of curiosity about finding a "better way" and how people are taught to evaluate ideas merely based on whether they are better or worse than other ideas. He emphasizes that people should be more curious about finding a better solution by taking pieces from different logic structures. He mentions that integrative thinking is under-applied in the world and the limitations of integrative thinking occur in straightforward choices, where people don't need to use it as much. However, he highlights the success stories of tennis Canada and the Rotman School, which were products of integrative thinking choices.

00:20:00
In this section, Roger Martin discusses the problem with MBAs and business education as a whole, where students are given narrow models and tools to match to real-world problems. He explains that this leads to students becoming "tool matchers" and applying one singular model to broad questions, which is why MBAs are often viewed as narrow-minded people. Martin suggests that educators should teach students how to integrate various models and tools to create a more holistic understanding of a problem.

00:25:00
In this section, Roger Martin discusses how education often leads to narrow thinking and specialization, resulting in blindness to important details. He mentions how even in medical school, people are taught to only examine one organ, ignoring the full panoramic view of the patient's health. This focus on narrow models and procedures pits reality against our desire for things to fit into familiar mental models. It is when one attains more work experience, particularly in the people-focused organizational behavior and human resources, that one begins to realize the importance of holistic thinking and the limits of models.

00:30:00
In this section, Roger Martin addresses the issue with overusing science in business and decision-making. He explains that the idea of good business is to make decisions based on analysis, which has been taught in business school for years. However, he points out that this approach is based on Aristotle's methodology of determining the cause of given effects. While this approach works well with physical objects, it implies that humans and technology interact in ways that can be predicted with data analysis. Martin notes that human interactions with technology are a part of the world where things can be other than they are, and therefore, analysis does not always work. To solve this problem, he suggests that rigorous thinking is needed to imagine possibilities and choose the one with the most compelling argument.

00:35:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the two different views of human beings' roles in the world: understanding the causes of effects or being the cause of effects. He argues that modern society is focused on predicting the future and optimizing for that one particular future without considering other possible scenarios. However, this hyper-efficiency comes at the cost of not creating enough slack to position for multiple possible futures. The speaker believes that it is the CEO's job to create enough discretion so that they can make decisions that are good for the company in the long run, even if it means not being 100% efficient now. The current modern capital markets are causing a detriment to American competitiveness because they are focused on efficiency and short-term profitability rather than long-term sustainability.

00:40:00
In this section, Roger Martin discusses how the short-term focus of managers, driven by pressure from the capital market, is causing companies to behave in ways that ultimately harm the company and its employees. He argues that this pressure is causing companies to perform less well than they could, and that the widely held publicly traded corporation is not the optimal form for companies. Martin believes that we will look back on this period as one where we thought this model worked, but it created all the wrong incentives, and that in the future, we will see more controlled companies. This creates a competitive advantage for private companies, family-controlled companies and super charismatic CEOs because they have more control, can build up the balance sheet, and are not focused on the same short-term goals as public companies.

00:45:00
In this section, Roger Martin discusses the agency problem with boards of directors and the fantasy that they could discipline management. He refers to the idea of putting a fox in charge of the hen house and notes that boards are like fire insurance that works except when there's a fire. Martin explains that good versus bad board members hinge on psychographics and attitudinal criteria, such as how they behave and think about their role in life, instead of their professional qualifications. He emphasizes the need for people on boards to believe that a well-functioning board is integral to the success of democratic capitalism, not just for the perks or prestige associated with being on a board. Martin applies this to his theory on bond rating, suggesting that the only reason someone would willingly sit in a chair called bond raider at Moody's or S&P is that they lack the skill set to trade bonds.

00:50:00
In this section, Roger Martin discusses the fallacy of identifying jobs for people without considering whether it is feasible for someone to actually do the job. He gives the example of stockbrokers and argues that because the only thing you can know for sure is that they are bad at picking stocks since anyone who was good at it would be working at a hedge fund. Martin believes that boards with significant personal ownership as a material amount of their wealth are beneficial because it gives them more of an investment in the success or failure of the business, takes them away from short-term planning cycles, and positions the company for multiple possible futures. Martin also highlights the importance of integrative thinking among great leaders, who tend to have a core characteristic of inviting feedback and wanting to understand why others disagree with their perspective.

00:55:00
In this section, Roger Martin discusses how raw materials can be recombined in new and associative ways, leading to more powerful solutions. He explains that great leaders can determine the worst-case scenarios or make hypotheses to ensure that they can make bold decisions faster. Martin claims that fear rules us and we must become better at managing our fear by telling ourselves a different story. He argues that if we understand fear's debilitating aspect, we will be more likely to take bold action. Additionally, great leaders tend to love people rather than just putting up with their frustrations, and to make irrevocable decisions, we must be willing to invest in assets.

01:00:00
In this section, Roger Martin describes his experience as the dean of the Rotman School and how he and his team had to create a new economic model to accommodate a budget of 130 million dollars. He had to double the size of the program, quadruple tuition, quintuple the endowment, and quintuple executive education. However, the university's economic models were "nuts," which made planning for the future quite challenging. So, he had to create a whole new economic model that enabled the school's growth while dealing with a 14 million dollar deficit. Although the new economic model was verbally approved, it took four long years of deficit spending before the new model was finally approved.

01:05:00
In this section, Roger Martin discusses the common patterns of failure and self-sabotage that he's seen over and over again. The biggest failure mode he's noticed is someone who is not strategic in their thinking, who believes they need to keep all of their options open and not make big choices. This often happens when someone is not curious and thinks they know everything. A good strategy, on the other hand, is a set of choices that enable you to win. It's not just a goal, a vision or a plan, but a cohesive set of actions that bring about the desired outcome. A bad strategy, in contrast, is often just a list of goals or a collection of fluffy statements that sounds good but doesn't have any impact.

01:10:00
In this section, Roger Martin explains that having a good strategy means to have a logical set of choices that enable a better value proposition for customers than any competitor. A bad strategy is one that chases multiple things, does not have a remunerative model, or tries to do the same as everyone else. He also shares a quote from a friend that says, "if you do the same thing as everybody else, you're going to get the same results as everybody else." Martin then explains why big companies struggle with innovation, saying that they often insist on proof before launching new products, which is impossible since no new idea has been proven analytically in advance. Consequently, many startups end up disrupting the industry and getting acquired by big companies that are not willing to tolerate failure internally.

01:15:00
In this section, Roger Martin and the interviewer discuss how the economy is driven by delusion, with nine out of ten startups failing, yet everyone deluding themselves that they will be the one to succeed. However, in contrast, large companies actively avoid delusional people during their hiring and promotion processes. They refer to this as the "stormtrooper problem", where an organization hires people with a narrow background and a checklist for promotions, but this hinders creative problem solving when they face unprecedented challenges. They suggest that by eliminating those who don't fit into their narrow mold, the intelligence agencies have to outsource to solve such problems now. They conclude by discussing how the fear of failure and not doing what's right but instead doing what's defendable motivates people in organizations.

01:20:00
In this section, Roger Martin discusses the story of P&G's successful launch of compact detergent despite the data not supporting it. He emphasizes the importance of allowing oneself enough time to make decisions and not prematurely closing off possibilities. He suggests imagining a variety of possibilities and asking what would have to be true for each one to be a good idea, assessing the likelihood of each possibility and thinking about how to make it come true. Martin believes that slowing down and thinking through logical subroutines helps him to make creative decisions, and he suggests that this approach can be taught through practice.

01:25:00
In this section, Roger Martin discusses his decision-making process when faced with choices. He stresses the importance of having a variety of options and not settling for limited choices. Martin advises seeking out raw materials through consultative decision-making with a diverse range of colleagues to make informed decisions, and he provides a framework for deciding between choices, suggesting that they should be made at the earliest or latest possible time and not in the middle. Additionally, he highlights the value of proactively gathering data and getting feedback from the market, even if you have not made a final decision. By doing so, you can create data out of nothingness and improve the quality of your decision-making process.

01:30:00
In this section, the interviewer asks Roger Martin what he wants people to say about him when he's 90 years old. Roger's response is that he wants people to say "he was a voice that we will miss." The interviewer thanks Roger for the conversation and Roger expresses his willingness to do it again.
