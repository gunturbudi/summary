Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
In this section, journalist Bethany McLean discusses how she uncovered Enron’s fraudulent activities. Despite not fully understanding the extent of the fraud at the time, McLean recognized that Enron’s valuation was unjustified as investors didn’t actually understand how the company made money. Although she doesn’t believe her story caused Enron’s downfall, it did highlight the company’s problems and contributed to increasing skepticism from short sellers and credit markets. McLean also discusses the information gap, pointing out the importance of understanding how to interpret the overwhelming amount of information available today.

In this section, journalist Bethany McLean explains the information gap in the business world, where skepticism about companies tends to travel in a small circle due to the lack of public information available. Companies won't speak ill of their competitors, and employees can't speak publicly without risking being fired. This veil over the information creates a problem where the information needed the most is not readily available. McLean also reveals that there is an inherent bias towards belief, as people tend to think positively about businesses and stand to make a profit if a stock goes up, even if there is skepticism about the company's actual worth. This idea also affects people inside corporations, where whistleblowers are scarce due to fear of retaliation or job loss.

00:10:00
In this section, Bethany McLean discusses her belief that culture is of utmost importance within a company; when everyone is a believer and your pay is dependent on the company doing well, stepping outside to reveal problems is near impossible. She compares the similarities between the unethical conduct of Enron and Valeant, calling them "equally problematic" in their own ways. Both companies were able to manage within the rules of the law while totally misrepresenting the economic reality of their business. In terms of differences, she points out that one of Valeant's transgressions was increasing the prices of drugs, which was more explicit as opposed to Enron's hidden shenanigans. Despite this transparency, smart money investors like Sequoia and Bill Ackman still invested in the company, which McLean attributes mainly to the power of personality and charisma that the CEOs, Jeff Skilling and Mike Pearson, possessed.

00:15:00
In this section, Bethany McLean discusses how smart people believe in something doesn't necessarily make it right or wrong. Looking at Valiant as an example, the smarter investors spent a considerable amount of time trying to understand why they got it wrong, and some remained defensive. The inability to see that the company was taking existing drugs and raising prices to unconscionable levels was a big problem. Although companies needed money to do R&D, where do we draw the line morally, especially for drug companies, and the trade-off between making a profit and moral obligations, which has become narrow in recent times? The focus on shareholder value and profits above all makes it tempting to do things that might be perceived as unethical.

00:20:00
In this section, journalist and author Bethany McLean discusses the concept of a company's purpose being more than just the bottom line. She points out that this idea is not new and that it has been tried in the past with mixed results. McLean also notes that private companies have more freedom in terms of operating with social or moral considerations, but history has shown that companies with broader social goals tend to shift towards being solely bottom-line focused over time. McLean also touches on her belief that very few white-collar crimes are done by people who deliberately set out to deceive others, but rather, it is a mix of rationalization, arrogance, and greed in service of ego that can lead to bad decisions.

00:25:00
In this section, Bethany McLean, a journalist and author, discusses the pernicious effects of a one-percent society and the innate human need to belong to a group but consider oneself better than the group. Greed in the service of ego is an addiction to power and status derived from comparing one's balance to those of others, even when one has enough. McLean believes that an ability to rationalize is a characteristic of good people going bad, a rationalization that's tempting to believe in due to the strong element of truth to them. She argues that visionaries and fraudsters are close to one another on a spectrum, and sometimes only luck separates the two.

00:30:00
In this section, Bethany McLean argues that while it's good to have big, grand, and ambitious plans, the inevitable frauds and blow-ups are the price we pay. She warns against reflexive cynicism and blind belief and explains how the system has evolved to benefit those who can reap big rewards while pushing risks onto others. She cites examples such as Wells Fargo and Countrywide where lower level employees took risks and lost their jobs while top executives reaped millions of dollars. McLean suggests that requiring executives at systemic institutions like healthcare and banking to invest a percentage of their net worth in the company could lead to better decision-making and accountability.

00:35:00
In this section, journalist Bethany McLean discusses the fragile state of journalism today, with local newsrooms losing nearly 50% of their employees over the past decade and magazine journalism in tough straits due to the failing economic model that relied on advertisers who have since withdrawn their funding. McLean notes that Google and Facebook, which have siphoned up most of the advertising dollars that used to go to journalism, are belatedly recognizing their impact on the industry and are starting to fund local news efforts. She also highlights the emotional aspects of the business world and how people are often drawn to a charismatic founder or a seemingly novel business approach, even when a rational approach would be more beneficial.

00:40:00
In this section, journalist Bethany McLean discusses the difference between good journalism and bad journalism. She believes that transparency and intellectual honesty are key elements of good journalism, rather than simply being right. McLean acknowledges the difficulty of achieving this in a world where journalists are pressured to publish many articles quickly. She admits that she has made mistakes in her own work, and that the crafting of a narrative often means that facts are overlooked in favor of a more universal story. She discusses how her piece on Elon Musk may be seen as wrong if Musk turns out to be everything his supporters believe him to be, but argues that highlighting some of his flaws is valuable for a bigger picture perspective.

00:45:00
In this section, Bethany McLean discusses flaws and character in the context of business. She questions which flaws matter and which do not in the success of a CEO or enterprise. McLean argues that flaws can be a character fault, such as not being a good parent or partner, but a relentless focus on one thing to the exclusion of others is a different argument. She notes that some character flaws have become normalized in modern Silicon Valley because of the exceptionalism culture. McLean also discusses how a strong cult of personality can be concerning and lead to a lack of collaboration and skepticism in the company.

00:50:00
In this section, Bethany McLean discusses the issues that arise with language and how it can be used to manipulate the truth. She brings up the example of Mike Pearson, who used language in a precise, but narrow way to tell a partial truth about Alium's profit growth. Bethany also admits that she has always struggled with determining what details to leave out of her stories, as she finds every fact compelling. She believes that good writing is about offering clarity and finding the narrative, while letting go of the urge to include every single detail. Her co-author, Joe Nocera, helped her learn to write by finding the story and disconnects in her drafts, which ultimately led to finding the essence of the story.

00:55:00
In this section of the interview, journalist and author Bethany McLean discusses the craft of writing and her approach to reporting. McLean emphasizes the importance of understanding the gravity of a story and how all the elements must hang together to make sense. She also notes that writing is hard work and a craft that requires constant improvement. McLean outlines her approach to reporting, believing that everything should be reported to get closer to the truth, while acknowledging the need for burden of evidence and the responsibility to give subjects a chance to respond before publishing. She also emphasizes the importance of good journalism, including fact-checking and getting unflattering information to subjects ahead of publication. In the age of social media and a lack of gatekeepers, McLean worries that too many people want the freedom to say whatever they want without the corresponding responsibility for truth and accuracy.

01:00:00
In this section, journalist Bethany McLean discusses the benefits and drawbacks of increased access and flood of information. She expresses more concern about the bullying component and the ability to spread hurtful and damaging information without any responsibility to air it with those concerned. McLean also talks about her journalistic tactics, including being respectful, curious, and trying to hear all sides of the story without bringing any agenda. According to her, there are no shortcuts to getting people to talk to you, and the pursuit of a story is a work of brute force that involves digging down rabbit holes and having numerous conversations that may not be relevant.

01:05:00
In this section, journalist Bethany McLean discusses the importance of setting rules around sourcing and being off-the-record before starting any conversation to ensure that everyone is on the same page. While some news organizations, like the New York Times, do not allow sources to be off-the-record, McLean tends to err on the side of protecting sources, especially when covering business since there are often consequences for people for having their names associated with something. She explains that as a magazine journalist, she can plagiarize freely from her sources in order to protect their anonymity, but notes that this is different for newspaper journalists who have to have a source on the record to claim knowledge or a fact. McLean also discusses her love of being able to talk to people who are smarter and more interesting than herself, and the privilege of being able to learn from brilliant minds like Warren Buffett.

01:10:00
In this section, Bethany McLean shares her experience of meeting Warren Buffett, who told her that he doesn't pay much attention to where his money goes when he donates it to Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This made her realize how important it is to focus on things that you're passionate about and leave the rest to those who are passionate about it. Despite covering stories on Enron, fracking, and housing situation, Bethany admits that she's more of a generalist, interested in figuring out things that seem provocative or interesting. She has zero interest in investing despite having skepticism towards businesses, and her reporting is not driven by personal investments.

01:15:00
In this section, financial journalist Bethany McLean explains her renewed interest in the fracking industry and the cognitive dissonance it presents. While this industry is not financially viable, it has caused significant changes in the global economy and reshaped geopolitics. This is because fracking allows for the extraction of oil and gas from places that were previously inaccessible, but these wells decline at an incredibly steep rate, leading to the constant need for investment. McLean also discusses how private equity initially drove the growth of the fracking industry, and the collapse of the capital structure is now underway as both investors and public companies back away from the industry.

01:20:00
In this section, Bethany McLean discusses the variations in operating costs per well, with the highest-cost producing wells getting shut off first during a crisis. McLean also reflects on the environmental impact of fracking and how it is left for society to clean up the mess due to fracking and extractive industries' actions, and this is problematic. She thinks that it's essential to be thoughtful about the liabilities of fossil fuel companies during the transition to renewables. The conversation also touched on values that parents try to instill in their children, and McLean shared that she tries to teach her kids to be kind and try hard while being passionate about reading books.

01:25:00
In this section, Bethany McLean discusses her parenting strategy of allowing her children to lead the way and choose their own activities rather than trying to shape and mold them. She shares her experience with her two daughters who both became interested in Judo, which led her family to become involved in the sport. McLean acknowledges the importance of failure in the learning process, even though it can be difficult to accept emotionally. She believes it is beneficial for children to see their parents struggle and fail as it sets a realistic expectation of life's ups and downs. Ultimately, McLean supports the idea of letting children take the lead and discover who they want to be.
