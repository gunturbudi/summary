Lisa Barrett, a psychologist and neuroscientist, suggests in "How Emotions are Made" that there is no set of universal or core emotions. Rather, affect is universal, meaning that your brain regulates your body in the same way as everyone else, and affect is like a general barometer for how your body is doing. However, how people make sense of different emotions is not universal across cultures, and therefore, there are different emotional responses towards various situations. Additionally, Barrett emphasizes the importance of managing our body budget for a healthy life, suggesting that getting enough sleep is the most important factor, and warns that there is a metabolic tax that can accumulate when we do not get enough sleep, potentially leading to long-term illnesses.
Lisa Barrett challenges the idea that emotions are solely responsible for tripping us up in decision-making and encourages individuals to use their affect as a cue to interrogate their emotions. She also emphasizes the importance of self-reflection, acknowledging different perspectives, and avoiding acting out of anger to gain a better understanding of reality. Barrett also discusses the importance of diversity and consensus in establishing scientific facts and encourages individuals to adopt the same principle to gain a sense of the wider world. Finally, she highlights the importance of practicing emotional granularity to become better at identifying and understanding emotions, maintaining emotional fitness, and building resilience.

Detail Summary:

In this section, Lisa Barrett shares how her interest in emotions began during her time as a graduate student studying self-perception. While attempting to use objective measures of emotion, such as facial expressions and bodily changes, she discovered that the evidence from science did not support the widely accepted belief of universal emotional expressions, and that each individual's emotional experience was unique and varied. This led her to a new research program focused on understanding how emotions were constructed and how they impacted human behavior.

In this section, Lisa Barrett, a psychologist and neuroscientist, uses an analogy of how Charles Darwin approached the definition of a species to explain how emotions are made. She explains that emotions are not fixed types, like species of animals or breeds of dogs, but rather collections of highly variable individuals. There is no perfect instance of a specific emotion; instead, our brains create unique instances based on information it has learned in the past and what will be effective in the present moment. Additionally, sometimes it can feel good to be angry or aggressive in certain situations, which is not a random occurrence but a feature of how the brain creates emotions.

00:10:00
In this section, Lisa Barrett, author of "How Emotions are Made," explains that emotions are not just one simple feeling, but rather a whole range of feelings that vary by person and situation. She uses examples such as fear and disgust, which can sometimes elicit pleasurable responses. Researchers look for patterns in emotions to find a common physical basis for behaviors rather than feelings. However, the categories that they create will still have some inherent variation. While some scientists define emotions as behaviors, others define them as feelings, and colloquially, people tend to think of emotions as feelings.

00:15:00
In this section, Lisa Barrett talks about how people often make assumptions about how someone feels based on their behavior, when in reality, our interpretations are guesses. As humans, we learn behaviors and patterns which ultimately become wired into our brains, which is why we are able to make narrow inferences. Babies, for example, need an immense amount of input after birth to slowly wire their brains to see, learn and understand the world. Culture also plays a major role in shaping an individual's brain, and this means that even patterns of behavior that seem basic were learned over time. Therefore, how we interact with infants ultimately plays a significant role in how they perceive the world.

00:20:00
In this section, Lisa Barrett explains that understanding emotions is key to communicating with others and helping oneself feel better or worse. Having emotional granularity, or a precise emotional life, can be socially helpful, improve performance in school, and aid in resilience when bad events happen. However, she goes on to explain that messages like "don't be angry" can unconsciously send the message that you shouldn't be feeling, and that when someone says this, what they're really communicating is "I don't want to deal with you being angry or sad."

00:25:00
In this section, Lisa Barrett discusses the old hydraulic model of emotion that often described suppressing emotions as being bad for one's health. Instead, Barrett believes you can think of your brain as running a budget for your body, preparing for upcoming activities and budgeting for things like oxygen and hormones. When the brain prepares to make a big expenditure, such as running on a treadmill, it creates a cortisol surge, which can be beneficial. However, if there is no expenditure, it can be damaging to your body to continually experience stress, fear, or anger.

00:30:00
In this section, Lisa Barrett, a neuroscientist, emphasizes the importance of managing our body budget for a healthy life. She explains that when we don't get enough sleep, don't exercise enough, don't eat healthily, and don't get enough hugs, we run the risk of running a deficit, leading to illnesses such as depression, anxiety, heart disease, and diabetes. Barrett suggests that getting enough sleep is the most important thing for our health, particularly for adolescents who require more sleep. She warns that there is a metabolic tax that can be accumulated when we do not get enough sleep, potentially leading to long-term illnesses. Additionally, she highlights that we should not get riled up with any emotional response without paying the bill and managing our body budget, which means getting enough sleep. Finally, she notes that some people may be more emotional than others as a result of running a bigger deficit.

meaning that differs from the way our culture does. Lisa Barrett explains that affect is a feature of emotions and perceptions, but not an emotion itself, as it is a property of consciousness. Mood differences result from some people having brains that prepare them to expend energy more frequently than others, which is called arousability or temperament. Even test results show that both men and women's reactivity levels are affected by daily hormone cycles, but women's brains are more likely to prepare them for a challenge due to the production of estrogen and withdrawal of progesterone. The brain is constantly interpreting the meaning of internal and external sensations, such as emotions and physical symptoms to make meaning, and cultures may differ in their meaning-making processes.

00:40:00
In this section, Lisa Barrett provides an example of how people make sense of things in a way that they believe is helpful but is not. It comes down to the idea of mental and physical illness when there is no fundamental biological difference between the two. Depression, for instance, is a metabolic problem that relates to feeling bad, just as heart disease is. Instead of separating the two and seeing a psychiatrist for one and an internist for another, treating both as metabolic problems would be more effective. Furthermore, to recharge and maintain positive health, there are other things that one can do, such as sleeping, exercising, having sex, maintaining a physical and social connection with others, and treating people with dignity and kindness.

In this section, Lisa Barrett compares having an argument with someone to exercising and states that recuperation is needed afterwards. It's not good for one's physical health to be constantly immersed in conflict without replenishing oneself. She notes that being kinder to each other and having good social connections can help. When faced with someone who is feeling something, the first step is to figure out what they want - empathy or a solution. Asking this question and understanding that it varies from person to person can help in providing the necessary support. Empathy could mean giving a hug or just being there with them in the moment and letting them talk, whereas a solution would mean being helpful instrumentally. Barrett emphasizes the importance of really listening and understanding, and not adding anything.

In this section, Lisa Barrett explains how the autonomic nervous system is responsible for responding to emotional situations automatically, and that one way to gain control over this system is through breathing exercises. By taking deep breaths, one can calm their system down, which she suggests can be practiced for a few minutes in the morning or night. Barrett notes that many people know how to do these breathing exercises intuitively, often from experiences such as crying or participating in yoga, but that the practice requires a lot of attention and mindfulness. She explains that breathing can also help individuals learn better because the brain has more energy when one’s focus is not tied up in their physiology.

would say is that there is no set of universal or core emotions. Rather, affect is universal, meaning that your brain regulates your body in the same way as everyone else, and affect is like a general barometer for how your body is doing. However, how people make sense of different emotions is not universal across cultures, and therefore, there are different emotional responses towards various situations. For instance, in one culture, the prescription for when one is afraid is to go to sleep, which is different than the stereotypical Western response of fight or flight. Lastly, when it comes to the idea of love being an emotion, it is important to note that all mechanisms involved in emotions, cognition, perception, and thought are the same in the brain, and therefore, it is misleading to label love or any other feeling as just an emotion, as it diminishes the self-control and responsibility one has over their actions.

In this section, Lisa Barrett challenges the idea that emotions are what trip us up in decision making, citing evidence that sometimes thinking can trip us up too. She argues against the notion of the "emotional brain" and "rational brain" and encourages individuals to use their affect as a cue to slow down and interrogate their emotions. Additionally, Barrett notes that certain things that help put us on the path to success are often only easy for those who have enough privilege to have control over their environments, such as getting enough sleep.

01:05:00
In this section of the video, Lisa Barrett discusses how the brain processes different types of noise and signals, and how being able to differentiate between them is critical for our nervous system. She also explains how our brain interprets signals and can distort our reality, making it difficult to discern objective truth or reality. Barrett suggests that we can practice taking other people's perspectives in advance, which can help us control our emotions in the moment and respond more appropriately to different situations. She emphasizes the importance of self-reflection, acknowledging different perspectives and avoiding acting out of anger, which can also help us get closer to understanding reality.

01:10:00
In this section, Lisa Barrett explains Naomi Oreskes' argument that scientific facts are established when a diverse group of scientists come to a consensus about an observation. She notes that this diversity is crucial, as without it, bias thrives, leading to decisions that uphold the advantage of those who make them. Barrett argues that everyone can adopt the same principle in their personal lives by taking someone else's perspective, which can enable them to gain a sense of the wider world and give them a better understanding of their present experiences. Through such realizations, individuals can gain a new perspective on life and start to feel more relaxed.

01:15:00
In this section, Lisa Barrett highlights the importance of practicing emotional granularity in order to regulate emotions better. By building the muscle of emotional granularity, individuals can become better at identifying their emotions and understanding their causes. This, in turn, can help in keeping emotions in check and responding more effectively to difficult situations. Barrett's emphasis on practicing emotional granularity can help individuals maintain their emotional fitness and build resilience.
