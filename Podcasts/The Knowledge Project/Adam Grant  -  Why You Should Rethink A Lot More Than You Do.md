Adam Grant shares his experience of being a "logic bully" and how he shifted his approach to conversations from presenting airtight arguments to inviting individuals to rethink their assumptions and clarify their goals. He emphasizes the significance of observing one's emotional reactions when facing differences in beliefs and challenging people's knowledge in private rather than in confrontational settings. Grant also discusses the benefits of practicing rethinking within an organization, taking time to process and think deeply about issues and being open to changing one's mind when logic and data demand it. Separating ideas from identities, adopting a two-question approach when making decisions, and practicing myth-busting with family are some of the strategies he suggests for improving the ability to rethink.

In this section, organizational psychologist Adam Grant discusses how many people spend their lives preaching, prosecuting, and politicking, rather than thinking like scientists. Grant encourages people to view their views as mere theories, and to run experiments in their lives to test whether their beliefs are true or false. Additionally, Grant explains that people are often hesitant to rethink things because it makes the world feel more unpredictable and strips them of their expert power. Grant came to write about rethinking after experiencing resistance to evidence-based advice from the very people who had called on him to help them rethink.

In this section, Adam Grant discusses the danger of defining oneself by certain practices or beliefs instead of values. Grant argues that an identity should be about what a person values, not what they believe. He uses examples such as physicians who define themselves as professional lobotomists or police officers who identify themselves as the types of people who would stop and frisk. Grant suggests that people should adopt an intellectual humility that acknowledges what they do not know, which leads to more curiosity, openness to new discoveries, and a willingness to learn. By following a rethinking cycle instead of an overconfident cycle, a person can doubt their convictions and remain flexible on the best ways to live their values.

In this section, Adam Grant and Shane Parrish discuss the concept of rethinking and the importance of being able to enter a rethinking cycle. They emphasize the need to give oneself permission to change one's mind and not to be too attached to being right all the time, as this limits growth and learning. They also discuss the importance of separating one's ego from the outcome and not being too reliant on confirming evidence. They suggest various techniques, such as making a list of the conditions under which one would change one's mind and being clear about the ranges that would trigger a rethinking process. Ultimately, they stress the importance of being a great rethinker, rather than simply a great explainer, and being excited about the prospect of challenging one's own beliefs.

00:15:00
In this section of the video, Adam Grant and Shane Parrish discuss the role of consultants in rethinking and advising companies. Grant dislikes being a consultant and prefers to be an advisor who challenges people to consider new possibilities and tailor their solutions to their own problems. He mentions that he has to sell his ideas too early or tailors them to a specific environment, and the approach he uses is to let his clients tell him why they are there and what they want to do with the information. Parrish asks how to balance openness to rethinking while taking decisive action because there's an escalation of commitment the more action you take. Grant doesn't believe there's a way to get the best of both worlds in every situation but says you can create conditions that increase the probability of being both open and decisive at the same time.

00:20:00
In this section, Adam Grant emphasizes the importance of process accountability in organizations rather than just outcome accountability. He suggests that we need to evaluate decision-making processes rather than just comparing the results and rewarding them with success. Grant proposes to build a rigorous and comprehensive assessment process for crucial decisions like hiring that will look for the independent standard of skills and values required for the job rather than interviewing people and comparing them. He suggests breaking down the process into several pieces and giving separate tasks to each recruiter for assessing a candidate's behavioral data based on their specialization, resulting in much comprehensive evaluation without being biased by intuition or a gut feeling, leading to a more algorithmic and productive approach to decision-making.

00:25:00
In this section, Adam Grant discusses why some managers are hesitant to make changes to their interview process to make it more structured and standardized. He also talks about the challenges of hiring for certain industries, including professional sports, due to the difficulty of measuring intangible factors like grit, humility, and team character. Grant suggests that building psychological safety within an organization is important for encouraging individuals to rethink and voice their thoughts without fear of punishment. While asking for feedback from employees may be a step in the right direction, it is not enough on its own, and leaders must be willing to accept and act on the feedback they receive.

00:30:00
In this section, Adam Grant shares an alternative approach to seeking feedback that has a more lasting impact on psychological safety in a workplace. Rather than just asking for feedback, leaders should criticize themselves out loud, which creates mutuality and a normalization of vulnerability. This leads to an open dialogue within the team where employees feel more comfortable acknowledging their own weaknesses and holding each other accountable for improvement. Grant emphasizes that this should be a natural behavior rather than a token tactic in order for it to have a positive impact on the organization as a whole.

00:35:00
In this section, organizational psychologist Adam Grant discusses psychological safety and the variables that contribute to feeling safe in different relationships. He highlights that trust and respect are the two foundational components of psychological safety and that people often misunderstand it as merely being nice to others, tolerating everything, having no standards, or refusing to hold people accountable. Grant emphasizes that vulnerability is vital in gaining trust and that effective leaders should show trust to earn it. He also introduces the Preacher, Prosecutor, Politician, and Scientist framework, where he encourages people to adopt a more scientific mindset to avoid getting trapped in preaching and prosecution while using politicking only to find the truth.

00:40:00
In this section, Adam Grant emphasizes the importance of being flexible in our beliefs and experimenting with our theories to find out what's true or false. He also identifies as a social scientist and values truth above being right, constantly embracing the idea that there's still a lot we don't know about the world. When asked why we tend to elect leaders who exhibit strength and resoluteness, Grant suggests that it might be because we often confuse confidence for competence and prefer not to deal with uncertainty. However, he reminds us that having too much attachment to vision can be counterproductive in the long run, and following leaders who think they've already found the way may not be the best approach when it comes to making well-informed decisions.

00:45:00
discussing changing other people's views is to turn the tables on ourselves and ask, "How willing am I to have my own views changed?" It's important to recognize that persuasion is a two-way street, and we need to be open to having our views challenged and changed as well. When it comes to changing someone else's views, it's important to find common ground and establish trust first. People are more likely to be receptive to new information if they trust the source of that information. It's also effective to frame the argument in a way that appeals to the other person's values and beliefs, rather than trying to convince them of your own perspective. Finally, it's important to be willing to listen and engage in a dialogue, rather than a one-sided battle for persuasion.

00:50:00
In this section, Adam Grant discusses the idea of a debate as a dance where both sides try to get in rhythm and sync, rather than trying to change someone's mind. He mentions a study on expert negotiators who spend more time planning for and talking about common ground rather than focusing on differences. He also suggests that asking how questions instead of why questions can be more effective in understanding someone's perspective and cultivating intellectual humility. By asking how questions, people may realize that they don't know as much as they thought they did, and this can lead to a non-defensive and collaborative conversation.

00:55:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the importance of curiosity and perspective seeking when trying to discern who knows what they're talking about and who can be trusted with decision-making authority in an organization. By asking individuals about how they're thinking about a certain issue and genuinely trying to see the world through their eyes, one can learn where their beliefs are coming from and find common ground. The speaker also addresses the issue of feign knowledge, which they deem as violating their core values as a scientist. They recount a personal story where an investment bank co-head derailed their recommendations with a shallow solution of throwing more money at the problem.

01:00:00
In this section, Adam Grant discusses how he used to operate in prosecutor mode and had a reputation for being a "logic bully," but realized that wasn't productive or helpful in changing people's minds. He now tries to approach conversations like a scientist, getting curious about what evidence could persuade the other person and trying to agree on valid methods. He notes that asking yourself what evidence would change your mind can be a powerful question, even if not asked to others, and suggests that challenging people's knowledge is best done in private, not in public or confrontational settings.

01:05:00
In this section, Adam Grant discusses his realization of being a logic bully, where he would overwhelm people with rational arguments and deny them the chance to reason through their choices. He learned to shift his approach from presenting airtight arguments to inviting individuals to rethink their assumptions and clarify their goals. Grant also shares a project by a middle school history teacher who assigns students a section of a textbook to rewrite, encouraging them to think critically and fact-check information. Another practice he does with his family is myth busting to learn more and experience the joy of being wrong. Grant emphasizes the significance of observing one's emotional reactions when facing differences in beliefs to examine personal attachment to particular beliefs.

In this section, Adam Grant discusses how he and his wife teach their children to rethink their values and decisions. Grant shares his past mistakes with his children, showing them that it's okay to be wrong and to rethink their choices. He believes that negative emotions like regret are teachable moments and that we should listen to them and learn from them. Moving on to collective thinking, Grant mentions his new perspective on charged conversations and how people should try to complexify the issue rather than focus on two opposing sides. He explains that binary bias is a common problem and we should try to understand where we fall on a nuanced spectrum rather than being on one side or the other. Finally, Grant describes how Daniel Kahneman taught him how to respond to surprises and the importance of being flexible and adaptable in any situation.

01:15:00
In this section, Adam Grant discusses his conversation with Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman, who shared with him the value of being wrong. Kahneman mentioned that he learns the most when he finds out he's wrong because it means he's now less wrong than he was before. Grant believes in the importance of separating ideas from identities, as individuals can become too invested in their beliefs and opinions, making them less open to changing their minds. Grant suggests adopting a two-question approach when making decisions, asking whether the decision is reversible and how consequential it is. If it's both irreversible and consequential, Grant suggests spending ample time rethinking one's views. Grant also delves into Amazon's decision-making process, which includes process accountability, where people read and reflect on a common document and discuss it, making decisions from a common base.

01:20:00
In this section, the conversation revolves around the benefits of rethinking and how it can be practiced within an organization. The guests discuss the advantages of taking some time at the beginning of the meeting to process and think about the issue at hand, rather than simply relying on PowerPoints or point forms. While it is crucial to give everyone the time to process their thoughts, there is a concern about the immediacy of reactions, and there should be an emphasis on taking time to think slowly and deeply. The conversation ends on the note that it's essential to be open to changing one's mind in situations where logic and data demand it. This shift in thinking is not easy, but it is necessary for organizations to become more innovative and successful in the long run.
