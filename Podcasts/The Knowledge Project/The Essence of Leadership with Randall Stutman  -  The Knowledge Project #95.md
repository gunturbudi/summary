Detail Summary:

In this section, Randall Stutman, founder of the Admired Leadership Institute, discusses his view of leadership as being behavioral rather than psychological. He explains that because people are so different and unique from one another, the psychological view of leadership suggests that the first step to becoming a better leader is to first understand yourself and the differences of those around you. However, he found that over time, people may better understand themselves, but they don't actually get better at leadership. Instead of the psychological view, Stutman takes a behavioral view of leadership, which looks at the specific actions and routines that eventually become habits associated with leadership. He goes on to explain how he became interested in studying leadership and the best leaders, as well as his definition of leadership.

00:05:00
In this section, leadership is defined as making situations and people better through strategic and practical engagement in decision-making, action, routines, and symbolism that moves people to be different. Leadership resides in decisions, actions, and messages, not just in people with authority or titles, allowing anyone to lead at any time. The best teams are those of leaders, not just a team with a leader, and common leadership behaviors that great leaders exhibit include keeping promises, admitting mistakes, showing up in a crisis, and providing feedback. Feedback becomes a critical function of leadership for making people better.

00:10:00
In this section, leadership expert Randall Stutman emphasizes the importance of understanding how teams and team cultures are formed to create coherence and alignment. He notes that effective leadership involves many functions, including strategy, change management, motivation, and the ability to present oneself appropriately to others. However, Stutman emphasizes that one often-overlooked aspect of leadership is its inspirational and motivational qualities, which he notes are essential for creating followership. He emphasizes the importance of building credibility, imparting symbolic values, and creating loyalty among followers, and notes that the best leaders combine results-oriented performance with strong followership skills.

00:15:00
In this section, Randall Stutman, a leadership development expert, talks about his search for admired leaders who have results as well as followership. He found that admired leaders possess a set of core behaviors and routines that they do all the time and that are universal and apply in every aspect of their lives, whether in their household, with friends, or critical strategic decisions. If leaders can master these routines and bake them into their style, they become foundationally more effective, even without adapting to different situations or flexing to people's differences. Furthermore, these behaviors are timeless and universal, and while we cannot know perfectly, great leaders like Susan Anthony or Abraham Lincoln likely possess similar core behaviors and routines that apply now and will continue to apply in the future.

00:20:00
In this section, leadership expert Randall Stutman discusses feedback and the importance of carrying messages effectively. Although feedback is contextual, Stutman explains that the best leaders always carry messages in a certain way that works with everyone. However, the practical literature of feedback only provides tips and ideas without universal applicability. Stutman reminds us that feedback should not be viewed as just a technique for achieving an effect, but rather a routine that is done consistently to become more skillful and masterful at it. When feedback is done as a technique, it makes it difficult for the person receiving the feedback to trust the intention behind it, which can create resistance.

00:25:00
In this section, Randall Stutman explains that the way leaders give feedback is essential in making it part of their routine. Negative feedback carries a lot more impact and weight than positive information, making it necessary to start the feedback with some softening of the blow. But, because negative information is naturally overweighted, most feedback and criticism have a negative tinge to it, and if a leader gives just a little positive and then several criticisms, the balance is out of bounds. Therefore, leaders need to master the technique of giving feedback in balance, starting positively, then offering negative feedback, and closing with positive feedback, all having equal weight.

00:30:00
In this section, Randall Stutman talks about the importance of balance in feedback, particularly in a leader's negative criticism versus positive feedback. He advises that effective leaders start with a positive note before delving into critical feedback, making sure that their positive feedback is just as vivid and detailed as their negative feedback. He emphasizes that an imbalanced relationship with negative feedback can cause people to withdraw or become defensive, while an overly positive relationship can cause people to become unprepared for constructive criticism.

00:35:00
In this section, Randall Stutman discusses the importance of giving balanced feedback in order to prepare people for success, be it kids or adults. Too much positive or negative feedback can prove to be detrimental, but providing detailed positive remarks before focusing on the negatives can lead to acceptance of feedback. Leaders who maintain a better balance in their relationships, be it with athletic coaches, dance instructors, or corporate leaders, are revered and respected for their feedback. Stutman suggests starting with positive feedback before focusing on the negatives, which can lead to better-balanced conversations and relationships. Furthermore, in order to repair an out-of-balance relationship, Stutman suggests having conversations where the conversations are balanced and not always negative.

00:40:00
In this section, leadership expert Randall Stutman discusses the importance of balancing feedback and praise. He notes that while criticism is necessary for growth, it's crucial to avoid an evaluative climate that becomes overwhelming and unrewarding. Stutman identifies high-standards as one reason why some leaders don't give praise. Instead, he suggests implementing a routine of third-party compliments, which can boost sincerity and be time-release. Giving praise to someone else about an individual's excellence is a good way to get in the habit of showing appreciation, even if leaders may not personally need it.

00:45:00
In this section, Randall Stutman discusses the power of third-party praise and how it can be used to elevate performance. He emphasizes the importance of telling a third party about someone's excellence and how it can come back to the person being praised in a more sincere and impactful way. Stutman also discusses the importance of setting priorities in order to improve performance, and how many leaders focus too much on long-term goals and objectives, neglecting short-term priorities that can have a significant impact on results. He suggests that every person in a leadership role should have a priority at any given time, and leaders should be constantly calibrating and recalibrating those priorities.

00:50:00
In this section, leadership coach Randall Stutman explains that a leader’s primary job is to have a clear and compelling sense of prioritization. Effective leaders are constantly reassessing their priorities and refocusing their team’s efforts towards achieving long-term results. Stutman gives the example of asking a teenage lacrosse player to prioritize his calculus exam over a game, as it has a greater impact on long-term success. When working with leaders, he asks about their self-perception of strengths and weaknesses, what they believe their team’s strengths and weaknesses are, and how others perceive them. Additionally, he notes that a self-aware leader will be as detailed about their negatives as they are about their positives.

00:55:00
even a few people around that table are benefiting from the current state of affairs. As Randall Stutman explains in this section, people who like themselves too much and are comfortable with their outcomes are often not coachable, and may even feel threatened by suggestions for growth or change. Additionally, Stutman notes that some people draw the wrong lessons from good outcomes, such as believing that their harshness is what earned high performance from their team. This can lead to a self-satisfied, dysfunctional culture that resists change and is unable to sustain positive outcomes.

01:00:00
In this section, Randall Stutman discusses why change doesn't occur in organizations and families when people benefit from the problems that currently exist. He explains that people like the outcomes they are getting from the dysfunction and don't want to change because they are benefiting from power or resources which would be lost if the problem was resolved. Stutman indicates that people can only learn and act when they are ready, and that sometimes exposing the benefits of change can motivate people. He also explains the difference between inspiration and motivation, stating that motivational actions compel other actions, while inspirational actions light the fire itself.

01:05:00
In this section, Randall Stutman discusses the importance of understanding individual differences and what motivates and inspires people in the workplace. He points out that people are really different, and what drives one person might not have the same effect on another. While there is a popular list of motivational factors, such as mastery, higher purpose, autonomy, control, and responsibility, Stutman warns that incentives play a big role in motivating and inspiring people in large organizations. He notes that it's almost impossible to adapt and flex to everyone's needs, and most leaders have a go-to that typically revolves around what inspires them. As a result, they miss some people completely, and others are impacted differently.

01:10:00
In this section, Randall Stutman discusses the universal behaviors of motivation and inspiration that every leader should master. He identifies 40+ behaviors of inspiration and motivation that are applicable to everyone, regardless of culture, gender, age or experience. He shares a story about Tiger Wood's golf shot in 2005, which is considered a game-changer for leaders. He highlights the moment when the ball was moving towards the cup on the 16th hole and how the crowd's enthusiasm created a vibration that could be felt up to the writer's thighs. Stutman believes that mastering motivation and inspiration can be a game-changer in how leaders motivate and inspire their team.

01:15:00
In this section, Randall Stutman discusses the universal motivation of inspiration: having people root for you. He states that everyone wants the people they admire and respect to cheer them on, to be fans of their success. The best leaders prove that they are fans consistently with everyone they lead, no matter what situation they are in. To be a fan means to keep the great news alive, and Stutman identifies various behaviors that prove leadership as a fan. By consistently extending and expanding great news in various ways, one can motivate and inspire people to respond differently to their leadership.

01:20:00
In this section, leadership expert Randall Stutman discusses the concept of being a fan of the people you lead, even during tough conversations or when dealing with people you may not like. He emphasizes that being inspirational and motivational is an important function of leadership, but it is not the only function. Leaders must also be able to make good decisions, hold people accountable, offer feedback, and establish a connective relationship with their team. During a crisis, Stutman recommends being transparent, compassionate, and working together to come up with solutions.

01:25:00
In this section, leadership consultant Randall Stutman discusses the significance of a leader's response in times of crisis. He emphasizes that it's not the actual incident, but the response that ultimately defines the leader's credibility. People will eventually forgive and forget the incident, but forgiving a poor response is much harder. Stutman advises responding in a transparent manner, based on character and values, and providing a remedy. He suggests that with consistent, value-driven behavior, parents can instill values in their children that will guide them throughout their lives.

01:30:00
In this section, Randall Stutman discusses the importance of family values and how they should be transparent and easily understood by children. While there is no right set of values, common ones tend to include prioritizing family and unconditional love. Stutman also mentions a new digital leadership course that his firm has developed, called Admired Leadership. The course's 10 modules cover various behaviors and actions of effective leaders, rather than just principles or individual viewpoints. Stutman hopes that the course will have a bigger impact and influence thousands of people.
