In this section, the host discusses the survival of Esther Perel's parents in concentration camps during the Holocaust. According to Esther, her parents credit their survival to sheer luck and determination. They were determined to stay alive, to witness the atrocities, and to hopefully be reunited with family members. They also had a clear sense of their identity and purpose. Esther shares some of the stories her parents told her about how they managed to survive, including her mother surrendering herself to a male labor camp and her father's last year and a half in one of the camps.

In this section, Esther Perel shares stories about her father's experiences during the Holocaust and how he survived the concentration camps. Her father was in 14 camps and managed to organize a thriving black market in the kitchen, which even fed the Germans. He attributed his survival not just to his own resilience but also to his deep friendships and the connections he made with others in the camps. Esther also talks about how her parents met on the day of liberation and how they wandered the roads, looking for people they knew, until they eventually found each other. Despite coming from very different backgrounds, they fell in love and rebuilt their lives together as refugees in Belgium.

In this section, Esther Perel discusses her insights from writing her book "Mating in Captivity" and how people fall into two groups: survivors and those who take life by the horns. Those who are survivors tend to be fearful and untrusting, while those who take life by the horns tend to use the erotic as an antidote to death and maintain hope and imagination. Perel also talks about the concept of permanence versus impermanence and how this affects relationships, noting that the impermanence of things can create a different awareness about the world and doesn't necessarily mean that one can't trust or be vulnerable.

had been mean and abusive because she was trying to get a response, trying to create some form of interaction and not to hurt him, whereas he was playing the role of the victim and shutting down any communication or change. By shifting the narrative and exploring different stories, the couple was more open to seeing their own patterns of behavior and to finding new ways of relating to each other, creating more possibility for change and growth in their relationship. This highlights the importance of language and the way we frame our experiences, both in relationships and in life in general.

00:20:00
In this section, Esther Perel describes how changing the story and emotional context of a couple can lead to a healthier relationship by shifting behaviors and perspectives. She shares an example of a couple where the man had an inflated sense of self and the woman was often seen as unreasonable. By looking deeper into their backgrounds and experiences, Perel was able to reframe their attitudes towards each other and change the way they interacted. Through an exercise in reflective listening, the man was able to better understand his partner's needs and communicate more effectively without feeling defensive. Perel emphasizes that changing the story requires embodying new emotions and behaviors for a more holistic approach to improving relationships.

00:25:00
In this section, therapist Esther Perel notes that in therapy, a middle phase involves carving out the shape of how a relationship could enter into a new dance with each other. The goal is to fundamentally change the relationship so that the partners will no longer be hostile towards each other over small things. She advises that the conversations couples should have early in a relationship are typically the same conversations they have 20 years later because relationships continuously morph and adapt themselves to external and internal factors. The important conversations revolve around values, expectations, and vision for life such as where they want to live, whether they want to have a family together, and how they envision family life. Additionally, couples should discuss closeness and separateness, boundaries, and commitment to togetherness.

00:30:00
In this section, therapist Esther Perel discusses how values can affect a relationship, giving the example of a couple with infertility issues where one partner wants to pursue medical intervention while the other prioritizes acceptance of fate. She emphasizes how discussions about values, feelings, beliefs, and assumptions are often about larger philosophical ideas that take place in small moments. Perel notes that contrary to popular belief, it is not necessarily differences in opinion that cause couples to grow apart, but rather how they experience those differences. Couples can grow apart through either chronic conflict or disengagement and separateness, both of which lead to a lack of connection and shared experiences. Perel also explains the importance of being secure in a relationship, likening it to the secure attachment between a child and a caregiver.

00:35:00
In this section, Esther Perel discusses the concept of secure attachment in relationships. Using the example of children experiencing safety and security with a caretaker before moving on to play and explore, she explains that security in adult relationships involves feeling both freedom and connection. This means being able to come back to the safety of a partner, feeling rooted and secure, before going out and pursuing one's own interests without worrying that the other person will become anxious or angry. Perel also discusses the three primary choreographies of arguments in relationships and explains that the form is more important than the content. Furthermore, she explains that behind every criticism is a wish, and that communicating this wish requires being vulnerable and putting oneself out there.

00:40:00
In this section, Esther Perel discusses how criticism is actually a protective device in relationships. She explains that when people criticize their partner, it's not necessarily because they're selfish or mean, but because they're trying to protect themselves from being hurt. They don't want to reveal what's special about themselves or what they truly want, so instead they focus on what the other person did wrong. Perel also notes that there is no such thing as too much honesty in a relationship and that all behaviors, including honesty and transparency, are contextual and depend on the specific relationship and moment.

00:45:00
In this section, psychotherapist Esther Perel discusses how to communicate doubts and concerns to one's partner in a way that is productive and not hurtful. While honesty is important in a relationship, there are certain things that are not useful to share and can be needlessly cruel. Perel advises taking responsibility for one's own doubts and not putting the other person in a bind about something they can't change. She also emphasizes the importance of being clear about what it is that one wants to achieve in a conversation and not just trying to prove the other person wrong. Lastly, Perel challenges the idea that difficult conversations have to wait until later in a relationship, as people often bring their past experiences and communication styles with them from the start.

00:50:00
In this section, therapist Esther Perel discusses how patterns in relationships can become predictable, rigid, and trapped, leading to couples repeating the same conversations over and over again. To change this, couples need to be willing to do something new and break the rigidity of their conversations. This requires each person to be committed to doing something different, regardless of what their partner does. Perel also differentiates between regular sexual activity and the erotic charge that couples may lose over time, which can lead to a disconnection in relationships.

00:55:00
In this section, Esther Perel discusses the decline of desire in long-term relationships, stating that it often stems from a lack of investment and imagination. She compares a lackluster sex life to a basic meal, rather than an exciting and special experience, and suggests that creativity and intention are necessary for a fulfilling sexual relationship. Perel also suggests that love and desire have different drivers and aren't necessarily always compatible, as love is often about closeness and predictability, while desire is driven by mystery and exploration. This creates a unique challenge for modern relationships, as people seek both security and adventure in the same place.

01:00:00
In this section, therapist Esther Perel discusses the challenge of maintaining a sense of erotic intimacy and discovering new things about oneself while also seeking continuity and predictability in a long-term relationship. Perel explains that it is important to cultivate pleasure and not just focus on orgasm or the performance of sex. She suggests creating a separate email address to write to one's partner as a lover rather than merely a co-parent or life partner, free from the mundane topics of management and logistics. This creates an erotic space that allows a couple to speak deeply to each other and acquire vocabulary to discuss difficult topics surrounding sex with greater ease.

01:05:00
In this section, Esther Perel talks about how intimacy can sometimes lead to a reduction in sexual openness and exploration as couples become more comfortable with each other over time. She explains that her sessions and her podcast help couples rediscover their curiosity for one another and see each other as mysterious and elusive. She suggests coming back to narratives and stories, asking revealing questions like "what did you do when you played as a kid?," and spending quality time with partners in dedicated rituals to strengthen relationships.

01:10:00
In this section, Esther Perel emphasizes the importance of dedicating time to the relationship of a couple to preserve their family. She explains that investing in the couple is crucial as the quality of the relationship in the couple is what will determine if the family will survive. Couples often neglect their relationship putting all their energy into work and family, leaving their relationship last; hence they need to talk about conscious uncoupling. Conscious uncoupling is basically freeing themselves of all the restrictions and assumptions of marriage to choose to separate without still thinking that longevity is the main marker for success. The more people remain tied in their bitterness, the more they bring that with them in the next relationship, so leaving a relationship respectfully, wishing the other person well prepares them for their next relationship.

01:15:00
In this section, Perel discusses how the end of a relationship does not necessarily mean the end of the family, but rather a reorganization of it. She emphasizes the importance of not demonizing the other person in order to justify the separation and encourages individuals to focus on themselves and their own accountability in the situation. Perel also touches on the concept of conscious uncoupling and the significance of how people end relationships, just as how they start them. She provides information about her website, estherperel.com, where individuals can access a newsletter, blog, training program, and workshop for couples called "Rekindling Desire."
