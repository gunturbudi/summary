Detail Summary:

In this section, Justin Su'a, a mental performance coach, highlights the importance of learning from both wins and losses. He explains that after a win, people often move on without reflecting on what they executed well, what mistakes the opponent made, and what they learned. Conversely, after a loss, the negative emotions can make it challenging to move forward, but by asking questions like "what did I learn" and "what can I do better next time," people can use that self-reflection to improve. Su'a defines mental performance coaching as the application of mental models and various fields of science to help people make better decisions and streamline their mental processes to approach situations like failure, success, and game-playing better.

In this section, Justin Su'a discusses the importance of talking to oneself instead of listening to oneself. According to him, humans have constant thoughts and chatter in their minds, which often traps them in their biases and emotions. To overcome this, people need to develop a relationship with their thoughts, understand what is signal and noise, and have a rational debate that challenges their thoughts. He applies the technique of debating, which teams use to debate topics like food, weather or movies, to debating oneself when doubts arise, and this technique helps in changing one's thought-performance interaction model. Su'a also highlights the unconscious level of the thought-performance interaction loop and states that part of the system often goes unnoticed, making it difficult to effect a change.

00:10:00
In this section, Justin Su'a explains how his job as a mental performance coach involves providing an outside view to people and helping them become more self-aware. His goal is not to diagnose or dispense motivational quotes, but to help individuals look at their thoughts instead of through them. Su'a primes individuals with questions to help them notice their behaviors and thought patterns. He emphasizes that the role of a mental performance coach involves rigor, processes, and complexity, and it is not about being a motivational or inspirational speaker. Su'a also addresses the stereotype that mental performance coaches are akin to snake oil salespeople and stresses the importance of evidence and rigor in his work.

00:15:00
In this section, Justin Su'a emphasizes the importance of being a guide on the side instead of a stage on the stage in his work with athletes. He places more importance on asking questions and helping athletes recognize the tools and strategies they already have to achieve their goals rather than simply telling them what to do. Su'a speaks about the challenges of measuring his effectiveness and quantifying the unquantifiable, but he emphasizes the value of refactoring or making systems more efficient, as well as helping athletes see their blind spots to bounce back faster. He also cautions against manipulating people's emotions or promising quick fixes, noting that the process is about helping individuals comb through their own process to get where they want to go.

00:20:00
In this section, Justin Su'a explains how he works with high performers, including elite athletes, business executives, and special forces. He emphasizes the importance of building a strong relationship based on trust and creating a safe space for individuals to speak without fear of being judged. Instead of pointing out blind spots or telling people what to do, he asks naive questions and listens carefully to their answers, helping them to understand their own experiences and emotions. By providing a space for them to think out loud, he helps high performers develop their own solutions and gain the confidence they need to achieve peak mental performance.

00:25:00
In this section, Justin Su'a discusses his approach to building relationships and earning the trust of the athletes he works with, emphasizing the importance of collaboration, consistency, and adapting to their busy schedules. He also talks about the role of the environment in shaping our subconscious and affecting our performance, and how we can improve our environment to enhance our mental performance. Justin stresses the need for collaboration among different departments, so that mental skills can be integrated into the organization's system and become embedded in the environment, rather than being perceived as a separate, optional activity.

00:30:00
In this section, Justin Su'a discusses the importance and power of environmental design in shaping behavior, referencing the work of author James Clear and his book "Atomic Habits." Su'a explains that the environment, including physical spaces, the people we are around, what we consume (such as reading materials), and organizational culture, communicates with our subconscious to influence behavior. He uses the analogy of fountains and drains to illustrate the types of people who can positively or negatively affect our mental environments. By considering environmental design and creating friction to avoid negative behaviors and make good habits easy to do, individuals can achieve peak mental performance.

00:35:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the idea of fountains and drains that can positively or negatively impact one's life. Fountains are people who bring humor and levity to one's life, while drains are constant complainers who always find problems for every solution. It is important to focus on the fountains and surround oneself with positive influences. The speaker also shares the importance of consistency over intensity and suggests starting with small, consistent habits before introducing bigger changes that can have unintended consequences. The speaker relates an example of an athlete who struggled to implement a new habit of meditating for 20 minutes daily but found success when scaled it back to 10 minutes and made it a consistent habit.

00:40:00
In this section, Justin Su'a discusses the mental model of consistency over intensity and how it can help build habits. He gives an example of how someone tied meditation to brushing their teeth, which helped them build a consistent habit. Su'a explains that people often overestimate the importance of confidence, and many professional athletes lack it, but they focus on their actions and not their feelings. To build confidence, one can focus on their level of preparation, current and past successes, positive thoughts, and establishing a purpose. Su'a also notes the importance of not letting poor performance derail confidence, as it can be regained by trusting one's training and abilities and focusing on actions rather than feelings.

00:45:00
In this section, Justin Su'a discusses the difference in motivation between average and elite athletes. He states that for the best of the best, there is an almost obsessive drive to pursue their goals, with some being process-driven and others being focused on results. He notes the "gold gradient effect," where a person increases their effort the closer they get to the goal. In order to maintain a player's motivation during difficult times, Su'a explains the importance of creating temporary goals and incentives, rather than relying solely on yearly bonuses. Monthly or even weekly short-term goals can be more effective in incentivizing and rewarding employees.

set for yourself, you need to be clear about your own definition of success instead of letting society dictate it for you. Winning tends to overshadow the great leadership and strategies of a team, which is why it’s important to look at the stories of those who aren’t winners and see what they did right. Success is more about the process and having the right standards rather than just hitting a certain goal. When people settle for "good enough," they stop pushing themselves to their limits, so it's important to strive for more and not be afraid of failure. It’s better to trust in your abilities and focus on the process rather than trying to control uncontrollable factors.

00:55:00
In this section, Justin Su'a discusses the importance of having a system that supports the standards and norms that you want to create. It is not enough to simply say what you want, but you need to model and signal those norms, and build a system that can support those behaviors. Su'a cautions that achieving the standards and norms you set will take time and effort, and people often underestimate the process. He also talks about the importance of being around people who have a higher cadence and passion towards their work and how it can push you to step up and reach your full potential.

01:00:00
n this section, Justin Su'a talks about being driven and how it is organic and cannot be forced. He encourages listeners to pursue their passions with full force, even if those around them do not fully understand or support it. Su'a then delves into his past and discusses how his experience as a missionary in Nicaragua taught him valuable lessons about teamwork, leadership, and communication. He also mentions the difficulties he faced while being in a foreign culture and not being able to speak the language fluently.

01:05:00
In this section, mental conditioning coach, Justin Su'a, shares how his experiences working with professional athletes have shaped his approach to parenting his three children. He has learned to allow his children to fail, to practice autonomy and to let them choose which battles they want to fight, as well as to share his own failures and admit when he was wrong. Su'a emphasizes that probabilistic reasoning is a framework he always talked about with his children, and that he learned from the athletes who had overcome the odds that they loved what they were doing, even knowing the odds were against them.

01:10:00
In this section, Justin Su'a discusses the difference between losing and being beaten in sports. He explains that in professional sports, there is no tiptoeing around losing as an L is an L, and a win is a win. However, when working with amateur athletes, it's important to understand that losing is when you beat yourself due to a lack of effort or preparation, while being beaten is when you did everything you possibly could, but the other team was just better that day. Su'a emphasizes that it's essential to own being beaten because losing is a part of life. Su'a also shares the importance of self-reflection after winning or losing and how success leaves clues that can help you learn from both.

01:15:00
In this section, Justin Su'a discusses the importance of reflection after both success and failure. He suggests that using a set of three questions to reflect on positive and negative outcomes improves mental performance. These questions include: what did I do well today, what did I learn today, and what can I do better tomorrow. Su'a also notes the danger of finite destinations or finish lines when it comes to achieving goals, as people often slow down or stop once they reach their goal. Instead, Su'a suggests establishing fundamental pillars such as quality sleep, nutrition, exercise, and strong relationships before exploring and collecting data on personal aspects such as energy, focus, confidence, mood, and stress levels.

01:20:00
In this section, mental performance coach Justin Su’a discusses the importance of asking the right questions and learning about oneself in order to achieve peak mental performance. He also discusses some of the best mental models for athletic performance, including feedback loops and systems thinking, using arousal control as an example. Su'a explains how athletes use their reference point of intensity on a scale of one to ten and create balancing loops if their arousal levels are too high or too low. He also touches on the mental model of the map is not the territory, emphasizing that success is freedom earned through mastery.

01:25:00
In this section, the speaker discusses his current focus on mastering different aspects of his life to experience freedom and creativity. He talks about using substantiated research and principles to come up with different solutions to problems. He also mentions his goals of having more time for his family, gaining financial freedom through understanding the psychology of money, and learning about nutrition and sleep to have more control over his energy. The speaker concludes by saying that mastery of the fundamentals leads to freedom, which for him is the ultimate goal of success.
