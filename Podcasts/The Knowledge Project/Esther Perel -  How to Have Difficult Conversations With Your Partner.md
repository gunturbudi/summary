In this section, Esther Perel talks about the power of external prompts, such as podcasts or movies, that can help couples have difficult conversations. These prompts can allow couples to develop a vocabulary and a frame of reference to discuss sensitive topics, which may have been difficult otherwise. She also discusses the importance of maintaining a separate email address where partners can write to each other as lovers, not just as life partners, which creates an erotic space and a permission for people to start saying things they may have been uncomfortable saying otherwise. Finally, she talks about how we tend to see our partners through a narrow lens over time, focusing on their roles as parents, spouses, and professionals instead of seeing them as multifaceted individuals.

In this section, Esther Perel speaks about dedicating quality time to one's partner, like having a dedicated hour per day or a ritual like meeting every week. Studies have shown that regularly having these rituals helps build a stronger relationship as it sends a message that the couple matters, and not everything else comes first. Additionally, she mentions that in history, family life existed regardless of whether the couple gets along or not, but now, the quality of the relationship in the couple determines if the family will survive, so investing in the relationship between partners helps preserve the family in contemporary times.
