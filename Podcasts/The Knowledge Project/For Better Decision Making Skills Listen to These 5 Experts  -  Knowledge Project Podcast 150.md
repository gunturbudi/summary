In this section, author Daniel Pink discusses the different types of decision-making styles he encountered after publishing his book. Pink explains that he had a big blind spot in his own thinking, as the book didn't cover the other major categories of decision-making styles. He explores the two other approaches to decision-making, which he has realized he is very unlike. The first is ethical reasoners, who genuinely start with a very deep and intuitive sense of right and wrong, while the second category is affiliational thinkers, who base their entire decision-making process on the collective consciousness of the group they belong to. Pink admits that understanding affiliational thinkers individually is the wrong thing to attempt, as it's essential to understand how their tribes or groups think.

In this section, the speakers delve into the concept of tribal thinking and why certain people tend to form groups rather than make individual decisions. Tribal thinkers tend to choose a tribe based on who they want to be with in their daily lives rather than making decisions based on individual judgment. This type of thinking may seem irrational, as a person may find him or herself making decisions based on an entire set of views and situations that do not align with their beliefs. However, tribal thinking seems to be deeply rooted in human nature and is necessary for survival in certain contexts, such as some traditional Asian cultures. The discussion then moves on to explore the concept of good versus evil reasoning and how human nature is drawn to using such reasoning frames, perhaps because a great deal of human survival depends on interactions with other humans.

00:10:00
In this section, the speaker discusses decision-making frameworks and mental models. He explains that tribal affiliational thinking is the most ancient decision-making framework, followed by the good and evil framework, which is more recent as it requires a degree of abstract thought. The speaker also shares that his definition of a mental model is "a world in the sense of science fiction or fantasy," such as the Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings universe, where the story and learning about the world are intertwined. He explains that mental models can extend to more realistic worlds, such as the universe created in the Law and Order franchise.

00:15:00
In this section, two experts provide insight into decision making skills. Venkatesh Rao discusses mental models and how they can be used to efficiently make sense of stories, but become noticeable when reading extremely foreign fiction. Meanwhile, Maria Kornikova, a professional poker player and psychologist, talks about the importance of reflection and distinguishing the action and outcome from the thought process when making decisions. Kornikova explains how recording herself playing poker allowed her to reflect and improve her thought process, emphasizing the importance of the right thought process for successful decision making.

00:20:00
In this section, Maria Konnikova, a psychologist and writer, shares how her experience playing poker helped her develop a thoughtful and deliberate decision-making process. She emphasizes the importance of having a mentor or coach who can provide personalized feedback in improving one's thought process. Konnikova also highlights the significance of being able to vocalize one's thought process, which helped her become a better writer and an improved psychologist. She touches on Immanuel Kant's critique of pure reason, which explores the role of betting in decision-making and how it contributes to forming an integral part of improving one's decision-making process.

00:25:00
In this section, the interviewee talks about the philosophy he takes from Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason and applies it to his decision-making process. He discusses how he critiques himself and began fact-checking more. He shares a personal story that illustrates the downside of blind confidence in our decisions. From his experience playing poker, he learned that humans are not good at distinguishing correct intuitions from wrong ones, and that we need to question ourselves and where our confidence is coming from before making decisions. He proposes that people should bet on the accuracy of their social media posts to ensure better thinking and decision-making.

00:30:00
In this section, Annie Duke, a former professional poker player turned decision-making expert, explains that intuition is only valuable when there is a valid basis behind it. Correct intuition is the experience acquired in something that we don't consciously have access to. False confidence can occur when we let emotions seep into the decision-making process, leading to irrational thought processes. Sherlock Holmes is a good example of acknowledging emotions and recognizing that they exist but dismissing them if they are irrelevant to the decision. In poker, the concept of 'tilt' is when irrelevant emotions seep into our decision-making process, leading to poor plays. Walter Michelle's work on self-control and hot and cool decision-making was focused on teaching people how to cool down their emotions and engage in rational decision-making.

00:35:00
In this section, Maria Konnikova and Patrick Collison give insights on making better decisions. Konnikova believes that emotions play a huge part in decision-making and it's important to identify and address them in order to make rational decisions. She advises self-reflection and mindfulness to help identify emotions and figure out the root cause of them. Meanwhile, Collison emphasizes the need for decision speed, explaining that making more decisions in less time is often better as long as there is enough confidence in the decision-making process. He suggests breaking decisions down based on the degree of reversibility and magnitude, and highlights the importance of treating them accordingly to avoid decision-making mechanisms from seeping into other categories.

00:40:00
In this section, Patrick Collison, the CEO of Stripe, talks about his decision-making process and how he tries to make fewer decisions himself. He believes that the need for a decision often arises because something else has broken in the organization or institution, and identifying and addressing that underlying issue could eliminate or reduce the need to make a decision. He also emphasizes the importance of pushing others to make decisions and delegating decision-making to domain experts. Collison believes that disagreement over instrumental efficacy is not problematic as long as there is agreement on the organization's underlying purposes, and organizations need to optimize their incentive structures, mindsets, and feedback mechanisms rather than focusing solely on binary decision-making. Stripe encourages a culture of learning from decisions by designing feedback mechanisms from outcomes to inputs and operations, rather than fixating on binary decisions.

00:45:00
In this section, Patrick Collison, the CEO of Stripe, states that it is too early to answer questions about the feedback mechanisms and interactions between cells and organs within an organization since Stripe has only recently reached over 500 employees. He believes it is hubris to assume that they have everything figured out and spends time scrutinizing other organizations to reverse engineer their successes. He notes that the tech industry is still figuring out how to optimally collaborate and coordinate knowledge work. Next, Annie Duke, author of "Thinking in Bets," discusses best practices for decision-making in business and everyday life. She suggests not being afraid of making decisions, as there is no certainty in any outcome, and to communicate this mindset culturally as a leader. Additionally, she recommends assigning probabilities to different scenarios and memorializing the decision process to help reduce fear and uncertainty among team members.

00:50:00
In this section, the speaker discusses how to make better decisions by refining one's guesses and becoming information-hungry. One approach is to wrap in dissenting voices and viewpoints to get a more complete picture. He suggests creating red team-blue team exercises where people are assigned to argue against the prevailing opinion or to switch sides if they disagree about the probability of a particular outcome. This exercise is to judge who wins the debate rather than who is right, so people can construct the best version of the other side's argument. They might moderate their views and learn from the process. Another approach is to conduct a pre-mortem, examining the patient before it's dead, where everyone writes down five reasons why the team might fail, making them more creative and open to failures. This exercise allows them to anticipate potential issues and adjust the probabilities of success or failure, making it possible to focus on the process of decision-making, which can result in better decisions.

00:55:00
In this section, Annie Duke, a former professional poker player, explains how decision-making processes in poker are similar to those in organizations. In poker, players make individual decisions but learn from group discussions, such as how to refine their strategic plan. They use this process in organizations as well, where they work through strategy and the decision-making process with the person responsible for executing it. Duke finds that her learning style involves talking to others about her ideas, rather than writing a decision journal, so she can have them challenged and receive feedback. She applies this method to her writing process and keynote speeches to refine her ideas and hear people's responses to them.

01:00:00
In this section, Annie Duke, former professional poker player, discusses the importance of having details and context when making decisions. She emphasizes that understanding the situation, knowing what information the decision-maker had at the time, and having a range of possible outcomes are crucial for making good decisions. Duke highlights the need for experts in a specific area to work through decisions together, providing a flow of context and past experience while considering the necessary details. Additionally, Duke emphasizes that without these details and context, she cannot offer advice as it may harm rather than benefit the decision-maker.

01:05:00
In this section, the importance of context and information in decision-making is emphasized. It’s crucial to understand the information that informed the decision and what possibilities were considered. It’s also necessary to question if there was information that was not considered and ask if there’s any information that could have led to a different choice. Furthermore, it’s essential to seek out people who may have disagreed with you to provide different perspectives, as long as there is an agreement that they will help in constructing an accurate view of the situation. Lastly, a story is shared about Toby's worst decision which was taking too long to make a decision that cost him time and money. He shares the importance of learning and growing from mistakes.

01:10:00
In this section, Tobias Lütke, CEO of Shopify, discusses his past struggles with decision making and how he learned to make better decisions. He explains that the most important differentiation in decision making is how undoable a decision is, and that if an idea is fully undoable, it's important to make it as quickly as possible. The skill of decision making is directly proportional to the quality of information acquisition, according to Lütke, and he stresses the importance of cultivating this skill. Lastly, he shares that he logs every major decision, revisiting it every half-year with a hindsight bias to learn from the process he used to make the decision.

01:15:00
In this section, the speaker talks about how systems thinking is important for decision-making skills as it teaches individuals to draw diagrams, zoom out, and declare the boundaries of the system to figure out what forces exist and how they reinforce the loops. By exposing systems thinking to individuals, it forces them to expose how they are thinking about something in terms of interactions, allowing people to challenge and get to a deeper version of understanding through progress towards a solution. The most common mistake people make is that they are terrible at deciphering cause and effect or even correlation versus causation.
