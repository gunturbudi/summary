George Stalk Jr., a strategic advisor, highlights the importance of time in manufacturing, software companies, supply chain management, and customer service in a YouTube video titled "Competing Against Time." He explains how increasing productivity through time-oriented competition can reduce costs, and how lean manufacturing and just-in-time inventories can give a competitive advantage in reducing cycle times. Stalk Jr. also emphasizes managing variance in supply chains to be able to recover from disturbances quickly, and he gives examples of companies like Dell, Toyota, and Southwest Airlines that have already incorporated time-oriented competition and variance management into their operations.

In this section, George Stalk Jr. discusses the concept of time-based competition and how successful businesses need to be faster than their competitors in providing customers with what they want, when they want it, and where they want it. He also emphasizes that many businesses ignore the importance of time as a management variable, which results in the addition of value only between 0.5 to 5% of the time. Stalk shares some Hardball strategies from his book, such as knowing your costs better than your competitors, and buying out competitors to round out a competitive position or extendable. He emphasizes that winners in business don't apologize for playing rough.

In this section, George Stalk Jr. discusses the importance of company culture and how it can be a source of competitive advantage, but only if it is oriented towards winning. He provides examples such as Caterpillar, which fosters a culture of competing with Komatsu, and FedEx, which focuses on delivering the "world on time." However, he notes that creating a culture that is responsive to competition can be difficult, especially if an organization is not already oriented towards speed and efficiency. Stalk also provides an example of how a company called Wausau paper was unable to implement a strategy for making specialty papers and delivering them next day due to resistance from within the organization. Overall, Stalk says that culture can be a powerful tool for companies, but it must be outwardly focused and willing to adapt in order to stay competitive.

00:10:00
In this section, George Stalk Jr. discusses the challenges of changing a company's culture to survive and thrive. He shares his experience in turning around a paper company by promising next-day delivery and making trucks go out full, which changed the economics of distributors and was a competitive advantage for the company. Stalk highlights that changing a company's culture is essential, but it must be done slowly and incrementally to be successful. He emphasizes that family-owned companies are more concerned about their reputations and their children's future than their public counterparts, and therefore, have advantages in decision-making and long-term planning but might struggle with succession planning.

00:15:00
In this section of the video, George Stalk Jr. explains the difference in performance between family-owned and public companies. It is often said that family companies have longer time horizons and are more profitable than public ones. However, when comparing them over two business cycles, it was found that family-owned companies were not as high-performing on profitability in the upturns of the market, but neither were they as poor-performing as public companies during downturns. This is because family-owned companies have a culture based on keeping the business surviving, growing, and being healthy, whereas public companies have more behavior from management driven by quarterly stock prices. The private model of ownership is becoming the predominant model of ownership, with family-owned ownership profiles being the most characteristic around the world.

00:20:00
In this section, management expert George Stalk Jr. discusses the differences between family-owned and public companies' approaches to risk-taking, predicting the future, and time horizons. Stalk explains that family companies tend to prioritize long-term performance over short-term gains and take a broader range of possible futures into account. The caution and risk aversion often come from the owners rather than management. Family companies also value a steady hand over high returns. The main challenge for family companies is getting the offspring to maintain interest in the business in the third or fourth generation. As for time horizons, public companies tend to focus on short-term gains, while family companies take a longer-term perspective. Family companies that bring in professional management are either an involved or non-involved owner group. The former group monitors the managers closely, while the latter takes a more hands-off approach.

00:25:00
In this section, George Stalk Jr. discusses the different time horizons that different types of ownership models have when it comes to decision making and investment strategies. Family-owned businesses, which are expected to last for multiple generations, have a longer-term investment horizon and often look for assets that will last for 60 to 80 years. On the other hand, public companies have a shorter time horizon of around three years and focus on investments that will produce quick rewards to compensate CEOs in the short term. Private equity firms, however, have longer time horizons than they did in the past and are starting to compete with public companies. As the ownership model of businesses changes, competition will have to change as well.

00:30:00
In this section, the video discusses the pressure on companies to perform in the short-term due to the increasingly short time horizons of shareholders. While companies that have long-term investors can afford to have a longer-term view of the business, companies with shareholders that buy and sell stock quickly must prioritize short-term performance to satisfy those shareholders. However, family-run companies are often positioned to take a longer-term view because they have the ability to delay profits and invest in future growth. The video also explores the challenges that family businesses face in regard to ownership distribution and growth.

00:35:00
In this section, George Stalk Jr. discusses the advantages of having cash reserves in private companies as opposed to public companies, and the importance of understanding how private companies compete. Stalk explains that most successful companies throughout history always had "dry powder" and played offense, investing in the long-term, which is something public companies are missing today. He highlights how private companies are positioning for multiple possible futures, while public companies are vulnerable to private companies’ behavior or view of the world. Stalk believes companies should compete based on “time” or “convenience time,” which involves giving customers what they want when they want it where they want it, faster than competitors can do it.

00:40:00
In this section, George Stalk Jr. discusses how organizations waste 95% of their time on non-value-adding activities, which can be eradicated if time is considered as a management variable. The most common time wasters in businesses are producing in batches, managing time, and scheduling. Thus, companies must organize the back-office and factory floor to handle small batches better. Through the Ford Motor Company's example, he discovered that Japanese factories held a considerable productivity advantage due to their ability to operate more efficiently with limited overhead. Therefore, companies must not only focus on their direct labor productivity but also minimize overhead productivity to gain an advantage over their competition by reducing costs and driving efficiency.

00:45:00
In this section, George Stalk Jr. discusses how to become a time-based competitor and how to take advantage of anomalies in the business. He explains how competitors often dismiss anomalies as insignificant when they can actually be used as an opportunity to find a new way of doing business. Stalk gives examples, such as a paper company with high business in Chicago due to a fast satisfaction cycle and an overnight service for one specific customer that ended up being a higher share of business. Stalk also discusses how Walmart used their logistics to compete with Kmart and how their focus on speed and efficiency set them apart from their competitors.

00:50:00
In this section, George Stalk Jr. discusses how Walmart changed its model in response to customer behavior, with smaller stores that were not as distant from customers, and high velocity warehouse stores like Sam's Club that required immediate payment, allowing for negative working capital. He also comments on the difficulty of competing against Amazon, given the expense in replicating their distribution center system. Stalk stresses that there is a direct relationship between focus and time, with more focused organizations more easily made faster. Thus, focusing the organization and deciding which products to specialize in is necessary for successful time-based competition.

00:55:00
In this section, George Stalk Jr. talks about the heavy spender phenomena in the retail industry. He explains that 20% of customers in a retail store account for 80% of the volume, with these customers having a different need than the other 80% of customers. These heavy spenders often require more product choices, a better understanding of the product, and a positive touch and feel with the consumer. Stalk Jr. highlights that every retail category has heavy spenders, and these customers require a unique approach to attract them. He argues that managing time, as well as cost, is key in strategizing in the business world.

01:00:00
In this section, George Stalk Jr. discusses how the element of time can help eliminate cost almost always. By speeding up a factory or process, productivity increases, overhead comes out, and these factories become simpler to manage, despite their complexity. Toyota, for example, has combined its supply chain processes and eliminated its scheduling department to push the schedule onto the floor, creating a cost reduction because overhead slows things down. Stalk confirms that whenever they introduce the dimension of time to the process, the cost problems eliminate themselves. Additionally, he talks about using working capital productivity to identify opportunities to use the balance sheet strategically to create a competitive advantage by improving the performance of the balance sheet. For example, Walmart pays its suppliers faster than Kmart, creating a level of performance that Kmart cannot match.

01:05:00
In this section, George Stalk Jr. discusses how time-based competition applies to both traditional manufacturing factories and software companies. Although the two have their differences, they share similarities in terms of adding value, taking time to get things done, and being made up of people and organizations. One of the significant differences is that it is easier to see things happen in a factory but not in software, which is all happening in the ether. However, reasons for slow software companies and factories are the same, such as compartmentalization, quality problems, and batching problems. Stalk Jr. adds that it is hard to maintain upward compatibility over the long-term and manage a transition from one platform to another.

01:10:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the challenge of offering a newer product alongside an older version while still making the customer feel valued and not abandoned. He shares an example of his own experience when his old iPad was no longer compatible for security reasons and he was nudged to buy a new one. The speaker emphasizes the importance of respecting customers and making them feel like they're not being abused by thinking through the process and finding a solution such as a trade-in policy. He also mentions how Zappos uses returns as a marketing opportunity to eliminate the uncertainty for the customers, while other companies like Walmart have ambiguous and not customer-friendly return policies. The speaker concludes that making returns a marketing advantage can be a success for the company, and he gives examples of Sears, Zappos, and The New York Times.

01:15:00
In this section, strategic advisor George Stalk Jr. shares his thoughts on lean manufacturing, just-in-time inventories, and how they can be used as a weapon to gain a competitive advantage. Stalk explains that lean manufacturing and just-in-time are essentially the same thing, involving small batches and self-scheduling processes pioneered by Toyota in the 1950s to compete with Nissan. He then discusses how supply chain management can create a strategic advantage, with the main goal being to minimize the impact of the supply chain crisis and create an advantage over competitors. Stalk gives some examples, such as ordering more frequently, arranging containers that aren't full, and paying a premium to be loaded last, to minimize supply chain inefficiencies.

01:20:00
In this section, George Stalk Jr. discusses the importance of reducing cycle times in the supply chain to increase profitability and improve customer satisfaction. The main challenge with reducing cycle times is the cost associated with it. However, minimizing overstock and understock can make the process smoother and faster. Stalk gives an example of how a women’s lingerie manufacturer increased shipping costs to avoid stockouts and minimized overstocks due to which they became more profitable. He also discusses how a company like Dell with a faster supply chain has an edge over competitors like HP. Although reducing cycle times may seem counterintuitive to investors and executives in the short term, in the long run, it helps optimize the system performance, increase efficiency, and lead to higher profits.

01:25:00
In this section, George Stalk Jr. highlights the importance of time in supply chain management, particularly in a high-tech industry like HP and Dell. Dell managed to use their supply chain against HP by consistently introducing products with better technology before HP was able to clear out their older technology products through the supply chain. Stalk Jr.'s insight on supply chain variance analysis is also mentioned, explaining how a faster and low-variance supply chain is much higher performing than a slow and high variance one, even though most people don't believe they can manage the variability of the supply chain. Managing variance is the next wave of supply chain management, and it requires a time mindset and a willingness to make adjustments. Toyota's speedy recovery from the J-val factory burning down in just two weeks, demonstrating their time orientation, is used as an example.

01:30:00
In this section, George Stalk Jr. discusses the importance of managing variants in a supply chain, which refers to the ability of a company to recover from a disturbance faster than a traditional supply chain manufacturing system. Southwest Airlines is an example of a company with low variance in performance which allows them to recover from disturbances faster than their competitors. Stalk believes that Amazon, Walmart, and Toyota are the companies that are closest to successfully managing variance in their supply chains, but it is the next big wave for supply chain management.
