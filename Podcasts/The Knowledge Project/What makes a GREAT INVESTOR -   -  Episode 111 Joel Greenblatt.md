In this section, Joel Greenblatt discusses Warren Buffett and his experience meeting him. He shares that Buffett was extremely gracious when he took his Columbia class for a visit and was willing to share his wisdom and teach by example. Greenblatt also learns from evaluating other investors and believes that a good investor is someone who can simplify their thought process and is passionate about the work. He distinguishes between naive simplicity and mastery simplicity by stating that he understands mastery simplicity right away, whereas the former is not easy to comprehend.

00:05:00
In this section, Joel Greenblatt explains that he tries to simplify things to make them obvious, rather than filling out a spreadsheet and doing 40 pages worth of research on a particular item. He emphasizes that he waits for the easy, simple pitches to hit and focuses on explaining some of the winners and why they worked out, as well as teaching while curating and choosing the lessons to be taught. Greenblatt also notes that successful investors have waiting in common and that they tilt their heads in a different way when looking at things. Furthermore, he suggests finding businesses you can figure out and skipping the ones with intense competition and hard-to-predict outcomes.

00:10:00
In this section, Greenblatt emphasizes the importance of looking at things differently in order to succeed in investing. He believes that the key to discovering great investment opportunities lies in recognizing other ways of looking at the market that have yet to be fully appreciated. According to Greenblatt, this is not necessarily about being better at analyzing businesses but rather about having the ability to value opportunities in places that others may overlook. It also involves keeping things simple and waiting for the right opportunities to present themselves, even if it means limiting the amount of outside capital under management. Ultimately, success in investing involves seeing a better version of reality without necessarily having an information advantage.

00:15:00
In this section, Joel Greenblatt recounts his investment in MGM and Turner Broadcasting during the 1980s. Turner had purchased an astronomical amount of MGM, and Greenblatt saw that he was giving away paper, meaning that he would eventually pay the debt he owed. Greenblatt used the big picture method and realized that Turner was creating value from MGM's massive film library. After buying preferred stock from Turner Broadcasting at sixty cents on the dollar, Greenblatt waited, and everyone realized that Turner was not going broke. Eventually, Greenblatt was paid in full. Greenblatt's interest in investing began after reading an article by Ben Graham about simple stock picking formulas that worked over long periods of time. These models suited Greenblatt because he found that markets aren't always rational or predictable, so investing requires a lot of hard work and reflection.

00:20:00
In this section of the video, Joel Greenblatt, a successful investor and author, explains his approach to sourcing investment ideas. He reads various publications that pique his interest and keeps up to date on world events. Greenblatt believes that experience and learning from past failures help investors avoid making the same mistakes. He emphasizes that being able to contextualize an idea is important and the ability to identify simple concepts that make total sense is crucial. Greenblatt also touches on the importance of knowing when to pull the trigger on an investment and the significance of position sizing. He believes that being more right than wrong is crucial, but it matters more with position weighting.

00:25:00
In this section, Joel Greenblatt emphasizes that position sizing is the most crucial element in investing. He said that being overly cautious when it comes to few good ideas that come your way is the biggest mistake one can make. He also mentioned that if a reasonable person won't lose much money, then the risk is minimal over the coming years. Moreover, Greenblatt shared that one should look at how much he has at risk and not focus on the size of the position. Lastly, he highlights that markets can remain irrational, and one cannot predict the stock market's future.

00:30:00
In this section, Joel Greenblatt discusses the current market situation, indicating that it is a market for stocks rather than a stock market, as most of the significant indexes are driven by big corporations such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Apple. Greenblatt states that these companies are some of the greatest businesses ever created, partially due to the internet and its franchises' types. He adds that the prices of these businesses make sense to him, unlike the internet bubble, and they're not overly valued. Furthermore, Greenblatt refutes the idea that a good investment strategy is to buy everything that loses money. Instead, he believes that the world has changed, and many of these businesses are investing in their future. While accounting systems account for these expenses differently, companies are betting that the lifetime value of their customers will last eight or ten years or more, resulting in a more significant payoff in the future.

00:35:00
In this section, Joel Greenblatt, a hedge fund manager and author, talks about how to approach investing in emerging companies. He states that one cannot know all industries, and it is impossible to predict which companies will emerge as the big winners. He advises that investors should pick the ones they are knowledgeable about, have particular expertise in, or have a clear vision of. However, investors should not take on too many bets but instead know themselves and what they are good at. Lastly, Greenblatt touches on how printing money may cause inflation; however, he believes the government should spend money as necessary to help the economy recover from the pandemic's effects and suggests that maturities should be extended over 30 years to help accomplish this goal.

00:40:00
In this section, Greenblatt discusses his concerns about the potential froth in markets and how he evaluates the competence of a management team. He emphasizes on the quantifiable aspects of the past capital allocation decisions of the management team and how one could learn a lot from it. He shares his experience of assessing past performance and not relying too much on the storytelling abilities of CEOs or CFOs. He highlights how the market capitalization of companies like Amazon, Microsoft or Apple would pale in comparison to a lot of start-ups that are getting a benefit of doubt but may not be as successful. He thinks that those companies would eventually end badly but would not bring the entire market or economy down.

00:45:00
In this section, Joel Greenblatt, a successful investor and founder of Gotham Capital, shares his view on how to assess a great investor. In his opinion, it is more effective to look at a person's track record and talk to the people they have worked with in the past, rather than solely relying on how they perform in an interview. When it comes to assessing public market CEOs, he highlights Jeff Bezos as one of the best allocators of capital in the world, who had an insightful vision for investing in his business and building long-term customer value. Additionally, Greenblatt mentions Warren Buffett as another example of an excellent capital allocator, and shares how analyzing Buffett's investment in Coca-Cola helped him understand how to pay for a business and compare it to other companies like Moody's.

00:50:00
In this section, the speaker talks about how both Warren Buffet and Jeff Bezos have influenced his investment style. He emphasizes the importance of valuing stocks as ownership shares of businesses and looks to Buffet as a model for this approach. The speaker also mentions how Bezos inspired him to focus on how companies deploy capital, giving the example of Costco's membership model. The speaker then shares a personal story about visiting Buffet and how he admired Buffet's graciousness and generosity in sharing his wisdom. Additionally, the speaker notes that Buffet's investment style does not include the use of stock options.

00:55:00
In this section, Joel Greenblatt discusses his take on stock options as a means of compensation and their accounting. According to Greenblatt, stock options are an effective way to incentivize employees towards a common goal, but the accounting of it can be complex, hence the importance of disclosure. Further, he believes that the cost of paying employees via stock options must be accounted for fully even though it's not an invented cost. Greenblatt thinks that stock options should be considered in terms of long-term value creation, and companies should not be short-sighted in their approach for short-term gains as it may lead to problems in the long term. He lays emphasis on the fact that companies should do the right thing over the long-term for shareholders and treat employees, customers, and the environment well.

01:00:00
In this section, Joel Greenblatt discusses the importance of transparency and providing enough information, even if they do not count it towards an expense in newly developed measures such as EBITDA. Accounting rules are viewed as a sideshow, and Greenblatt emphasizes the need for management to think about their long-term plan and economics to continue building value over time. He confesses that he doesn't have a solution to adjust investors' mindset towards long-term thinking rather than solely focusing on quarterly results. However, he recognizes that the market gives value to long-term visionaries investing over the long term. Greenblatt focuses on successful capital allocators and tries to homogenize their financial statement to understand their economic reality.

01:05:00
In this section, Greenblatt discusses the strategies that were implemented to create and sustain the success of Success Academy, an effective education system that serves low-income and minority students in New York City. The model was based on the principle that properly training and supporting an average teacher could lead to great results. The measures used to track academic performance of the schools included raising academic standards and improving teaching methodologies. However, Greenblatt laments that despite the significant success that Success Academy has had, it has not been replicated in other districts as he had hoped, citing a lack of interest from the current mayor.

01:10:00
In this section of the transcript, Joel Greenblatt discusses the current education system's high failure rate for low-income and minority students and how the top-performing charter and district schools provide the right support for every student to achieve high levels of success. Despite success at the best schools, 10 out of 11 minority or low-income students in top 50 urban centers still struggle. Greenblatt proposes alternative certification through skill-based tests, courses, and certificates rather than a college degree that can help major companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon attract and retain diverse talent while helping to close the achievement gap.

01:15:00
In this section, Joel Greenblatt discusses the various ways companies can test for decision-making and critical thinking skills, including game-based tests. He notes that studies have shown that a more diverse workforce can lead to a higher level of profits. Greenblatt believes that there is a lot of wasted talent due to a low graduation rate and that companies can help diverse candidates by creating demand for these skills. He concludes the conversation by thanking the interviewer for his time.
