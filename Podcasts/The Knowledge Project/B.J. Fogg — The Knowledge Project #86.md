In this YouTube video, B.J. Fogg discusses his experiences growing up as a Mormon in California and how they influenced his interest in studying human behavior and creating habits. Fogg argues that while data and statistics can be useful for identifying specific behaviors, they are not effective in creating behavior-changing habits. Instead, people need specific information about how to change their behavior, which can be achieved through his behavior model of motivation, ability, and prompt. Furthermore, Fogg suggests that people need to be specific about their behaviors and strategies by making them easier to do or redesigning the environment. He emphasizes the importance of motivation, breaking down motivation into three core motivators: pleasure/pain, hope/fear, and social acceptance/rejection. Fogg also says that success in one area can help people unlock and diminish fear in other areas, creating a sense of self-efficacy that wires in the habit and sustains change over time. Finally, Fogg discusses how the built environment plays a big role in behavior and shares his strategies for managing his own environment to optimize his habits and be more effective in helping others.
BJ Fogg, a behavior scientist, shares his perspective on habits and disagrees with the claim that repetition creates habits. Fogg believes that it is emotions that cause our brain to rewire and that understanding the role of emotions in creating habits can make change more manageable and enjoyable. He also discusses his technique called "celebration" which involves intentionally creating positive emotions to help wire a new habit quickly. Shane expresses his gratitude for Fogg's insights, and Fogg thanks Shane for the opportunity to join the conversation.

Detail Summary:

In this section, B.J. Fogg talks about his childhood and how it influenced his interest in habits and behavior optimization. He grew up in a culture, being raised as a Mormon in California, where changing behavior was a prevalent part of life. He later became interested in helping people be happier and healthier, and studying human behavior, which led him to research and test ways of creating habits. Fogg explains how nature is an essential element that makes him feel happy and healthy, and connecting with nature is different for everyone. Despite the environment changes from Stanford campus to Maui, his interaction with his research lab and students remains the same through video conferencing and messaging. Fogg analyzes the myth that giving people the right information will lead to a change in behavior and finds that it is not reliable for most people.

00:05:00
In this section, B.J. Fogg discusses how the quantified self movement did not necessarily add up to create lasting change in people's lives, despite the availability of data and statistics on health and productivity. He notes that while data and statistics can be useful for providing information about specific behaviors, they are not effective in creating behavior-changing habits. Instead, Fogg suggests that people need specific information about how to change their behavior, which can be achieved through his behavior model of motivation, ability, and prompt. Furthermore, Fogg advises industry innovators to help people get specific about their behaviors and strategies by making them easier to do or by redesigning the environment or context.

00:10:00
In this section, B.J. Fogg discusses the three buckets that can be used to facilitate behavior change. These are changing the person, changing the environment, and scaling back the behavior. He explains that changing the environment involves giving people or oneself tools and resources, including anything that makes the behavior easier to do. This can be physical, but it can also include digital environments or even the way one perceives their surroundings. However, Fogg notes that he has not been able to create a model or theory of environment and context that elegantly solves the puzzle. Finally, he briefly touches on motivation, which is another factor that affects behavior change.

00:15:00
In this section, BJ Fogg discusses his framework for motivation as it relates to behavior change. He explains that motivation is one of the three components, along with ability and prompt, that contribute to any behavior. He breaks down motivation into three core motivators: pleasure/pain, hope/fear, and social acceptance/rejection. Fogg also distinguishes between two models for motivation, an analytical model and a design model, and explains how they differ. Lastly, he outlines three buckets of motivation design: align with what people already want to do, apply a benefit or punishment to the action, or create motivation through the surrounding context or environment.

00:20:00
In this section, B.J. Fogg discusses the three types of motivation and the importance of prompting behavior during a motivation wave. The motivation wave is a contextual type of motivation that can increase or decrease based on external factors. Fogg emphasizes that in order to get people to do hard behaviors, it's essential to prompt them during a motivation wave, when they're more likely to do the hard behavior. He also talks about the compensatory relationship between motivation and ability, where if motivation is low, ability must be high to achieve the desired behavior. This insight is what the tiny habits method is based on, and it's essential to adjust the difficulty of the behavior according to the level of motivation in a particular moment.

00:25:00
In this section, B.J. Fogg discusses the difficulty in understanding an individual's level of motivation in a universal way, stating that good salespeople, coaches, and teachers have a way of intuitively sensing a person's motivation level, but no universal way to determine it. Fogg also indicates that the amount of work a person is willing to undertake is an indicator of their motivation level. Additionally, Fogg recognizes different contexts in which an individual's motivation is influenced by different identities or roles. Finally, Fogg highlights self-efficacy, which is a generalizable sense of an individual's belief that they can achieve a task, regardless of the context.

00:30:00
In this section, BJ Fogg discusses how the feeling of success in one area can help people unlock and diminish their fear in other areas, making them more inclined to take action and do harder things. This sense of self-efficacy can generalize across domains, as the feeling of success helps wire in the habit and sustain the change over time. This has been seen in Tiny Habits coaching, as people see that they can change behavior and reach success, which changes their identity and the way they see themselves. This shift in identity is what helps build confidence and change self-talk, making small changes that change everything.

00:35:00
In this section, B.J. Fogg talks about the power of positive emotions and the role of stories in perpetuating a sense of cause and effect in our brains. He explains how well-told stories can establish hope or fear, and how our brains have a hard time pushing back against a persuasive narrative. Fogg believes that stories are a technology for transmitting cause and effect relationships within communities and through the generations. He also talks about the importance of believing in oneself when starting a business, even if it means deluding oneself at times. Finally, Fogg touches on group behavior change and the research that he conducted at Stanford University about how to effect changes in tribes.

00:40:00
In this section, B.J. Fogg discusses the different patterns that work for changing groups together. One way to make a behavior change is to join a destination group or a journey group. A destination group is a community that is already doing what you aspire to do, while a journey group is where you join up with other novices who also want to make the same change. The role of leadership also plays a part, and there is often a guru situated within either type of group. Finally, Fogg discusses the role of one's social environment, including friends and their influence on behavior change. He emphasizes the need to optimize oneself and achieve one's aspirations by understanding which friendships to keep and which to limit or end if they are not taking you in the right direction.

00:45:00
In this section of the interview, B.J. Fogg discusses the various parts of our environment that often influence our behavior. He emphasizes that our built environment plays a big role and speaks about how lighting and sound can impact our behavior. Fogg also mentions that he often rearranges his environment to make good behaviors easier to do. He gives the example of how he has a drawer with his daily vitamins and supplements and, to make this routine easier to perform, he has removed the caps from the bottles and placed them in the drawer. Fogg also talks about his weekly routines and how he sets aside time for habits like tidying his car, cleaning the bathroom, and arranging the fridge.

00:50:00
In this section, B.J. Fogg explains his approach to managing his environment to optimize his habits and be more effective in helping others. He discusses his system of setting small tasks like tidying one thing in the car, one thing in the fridge, and one thing in the vitamin drawer, instead of the daunting prospect of having to clean the entire space. Fogg also talks about how he and his partner started calling their organized and healthy-focused fridge a "super fridge." He discusses how habits can go both ways, and he offers his three-phase master plan for behavior change designed to help people break bad habits effectively.

00:55:00
In this section, B.J. Fogg discusses how some people trivialize the difficulty of breaking ingrained habits, which can lead to individuals blaming themselves when they fail to stop harmful behaviors. Fogg offers a comprehensive three-phase system for behavior change, with phase one focusing on creating good habits and shifting identity. Phase two involves untangling the habit, identifying the prompts, manipulatability, and motivation. If the habit cannot be stopped, phase three offers a systematic approach to swapping the behavior for something more motivating or easier to do. Fogg's book, Tiny Habits, includes flowcharts to help readers navigate the system, although they were almost removed by editors who deemed them too complicated.

01:00:00
In this section, BJ Fogg explains his perspective on habits as well as the inaccuracy of the claim that repetition creates habits. He argues that it is emotions that cause our brain to rewire, not repetition. He adds that understanding the role of emotions in creating habits can make change more manageable and enjoyable, rather than as something people must suffer through. BJ also shares his technique called celebration, which involves intentionally creating a positive emotion to help wire a new habit quickly.
