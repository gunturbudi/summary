Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
In this section, Todd Simkin, a trader at Susquehanna, discusses the importance of avoiding hindsight bias when evaluating trading decisions. This bias can lead to the assumption that successful traders have figured everything out and don't need intervention, while unsuccessful traders need intervention. However, Simkin emphasizes the need for experienced traders and peers to provide feedback without being informed about the resulting trade outcomes. He explains how his company deals with information asymmetry by building internal research capabilities and updating opinions based on all available information in a Bayesian way. Finally, he defines Bayesian thinking as a probabilistic approach to updating information.

00:05:00
In this section, Todd Simkin discusses how to update probabilities based on new information, using examples of a die roll and option pricing. He explains how, in order to make better long-term decisions, it's important to appropriately weigh and update our priors with new information instead of being biased by factors such as confirmation or hindsight bias. Simkin also touches on some of the decision biases uncovered by luminaries in behavioral economics such as Danny Kahneman and Taversky.

00:10:00
In this section, Todd Simkin discusses the importance of having second-order knowledge and the tendency of people to discount information that challenges their tribal beliefs. He shared a quote about the importance of making small choices in discipline, duty, and integrity, leading up to who we are as individuals during crucial choices in our lives. He also talks about the tendency of people to align themselves with a particular tribe, leading them to dismiss information that goes against their beliefs, which he believes ultimately affects their overall decision-making abilities.

00:15:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the idea of heuristics and how they can be both beneficial and harmful when making long-term decisions. He explains that heuristics are mental shortcuts that allow us to make decisions quickly without having to think through every aspect of a situation. However, heuristics can also prevent individuals from accurately weighing new information or contemplating each action or behavior. The speaker provides the example of making a personal rule not to eat dessert, as this eliminates the need to make a decision each time dessert is offered. He notes that having rules can be useful, but it can become problematic when it becomes part of a larger identity, such as a group of non-dessert eaters where violating the rule means being removed from the group.

00:20:00
In this section, Simkin discusses the difficulty of going against the tribe and the dangers of call-out culture. He then highlights the potential benefits of understanding cognitive biases, not to prevent mistakes, but as a framework for understanding why we make them. Simkin emphasizes the importance of communicating our decisions with others and creating a culture that rewards truth-finding rather than personal attacks. By talking through our decisions with others, we can receive feedback and improve our decision-making processes. Ultimately, Simkin suggests that having a diverse group of people brainstorming on trading decisions will lead to more accurate, fair valuations of assets.

00:25:00
In this section, Todd Simkin, a former trader at Susquehanna, talks about his career journey that led him to his current role in educating junior traders. He joined Susquehanna right after college and initially traded equity options before moving to trade American Depository Receipts, an international equity arbitrage. He later traded fixed income during the fixed income crisis of the late 2000s before transitioning to teaching. Susquehanna has always had a growth mindset when it comes to training traders, believing that smart and educable people can be taught and improved upon. One important factor in this is having traders be vocal about their thought processes and willing to change their behavior when they're wrong.

00:30:00
In this section, Todd Simkin, an educator at SIG, discusses his unique approach to teaching traders using core educational principles, such as modeling the learning process, finding out where someone is, identifying what they can grow to, and providing support to become a better decision-maker. He draws from Lev Vygotsky's theories about education and sociocultural interactions, where education comes from interactions with more knowledgeable others. The goal is to recognize someone's zone of proximal development, provide scaffolding, and push them to improve over time, moving into new areas of mastery that expand their knowledge and competence.

00:35:00
In this section, Todd Simkin discusses the importance of communication with experts and more knowledgeable individuals to overcome educated incompetence, especially in fields with imperfect information and uncertainty, such as trading. To avoid hindsight bias, it is essential to analyze the process rather than the results. Simkin suggests shielding the person giving feedback from knowing the outcome of the trade by telling them only the information available at the time of the transaction, which they use to give feedback. In trading, experienced individuals often model the process of decision-making, which is more effective than just stating what to do. Simkin emphasizes the learning loop of starting with an experience, reflecting on it, drawing an abstraction, and then taking action. Lastly, experienced teachers model how to behave in situations, establishing a culture of learning.

00:40:00
In this section, Todd Simkin, a former trader, discusses how the answer to most questions in the world of trading is usually "it depends." Similarly to poker, where there is no one-size-fits-all answer to what action you should take in a particular situation, trading can be the same way. He explains how experienced traders can disagree with each other, but that doesn't mean they are dismissing each other's ideas. They are models to show how to think through and improve the decision-making process to reach answers that are more comfortable for a respective trader. Simkin also touches upon the idea that having answers at our fingertips can hinder our problem-solving skills, as we become reliant on others to solve issues for us.

00:45:00
In this section, Todd Simkin discusses how people often search for the one answer to a problem and want a sense of certainty. He explains that we should focus on thinking through problems individually and as a society to ensure we're making the right decisions. Moreover, he highlights the importance of probabilistic thinking and explains how people should assess their predictions from different angles to make better decisions. He advises looking for super forecasters who are good at making probabilistic predictions on many things and always have a way to change their probability assessment to improve the quality of their predictions. Finally, he mentions using weather forecasters as an example of how measuring performance by giving feedback can lead to better decision-making.

00:50:00
In this section of the transcript, Todd Simkin talks about the accuracy of forecasts and how those making predictions are held accountable for them. He explains that the places where people are inaccurate are areas where they haven't had much feedback or where nobody holds them accountable. He also discusses the founders of Susquehanna and how their experience playing poker together allowed them to develop the decision-making principles they apply in their business. Applying their Bayesian decision principles at the poker table allowed them to do well in Vegas, and they found they could apply the same decision process to the markets.

00:55:00
In this section, Todd Simkin, founder of TTS Capital, discusses how their trading education approach starts off with the open outcry environment, which builds the underlying decision process that later goes into the models for electronic trading. Simkin emphasizes the importance of teaching traders how to think through trading and build up their understanding of risk, asymmetric information, selection bias, and noisy outcomes so that they can make the right decision and still get unlucky. Simkin also emphasizes the importance of three variables that can improve a trader's ability to see reality, namely, talk, probabilistic thinking, and being open to feedback and disconfirming information. Additionally, Simkin discusses the importance of constructive ways of communication to improve the input from others in the decision process.

01:00:00
In this section, Todd Simkin discusses constructive versus non-constructive ways of seeking feedback. He highlights the importance of leading with an honest acknowledgement of one's shortcomings and inviting feedback in an open way. Todd emphasizes the significance of valuing feedback and actually changing one's behavior based on it. The section also includes an anecdote that emphasizes the importance of modeling constructive communication and recognizing areas of expertise in decision-making. Todd suggests that constructive communication can be taught through intentional modeling and conveying decision-making approaches through language.

01:05:00
offering advice or opinions, Todd Simkin emphasizes the importance of sharing the process behind decision-making in order to foster more constructive conversations with both children and traders. He suggests asking questions such as "what is the cost of this?" and "what are the benefits of this?" when trying to reach a decision. In addition, he shares two seemingly simple but effective techniques that he uses intentionally with his kids: reflective listening, where you tell the person what you heard them say, and allowing space for them to finish their own thought. He also shared an anecdote about how reflective listening seemed like dumb advice until it turned out to be effective in helping his friend understand herself and her roommate better.

01:10:00
In this section of the video, Todd Simkin discusses how understanding someone's feelings is an important starting point in terms of decision making. A principle of charity should be given to the person speaking, to assume that they are well-intentioned which helps in reaching an amicable agreement. Simkin believes that thinking in probabilistic terms is vital for non-trading personal dynamics. He also talks about how the negotiation process is collaborative in nature, and mutual benefits must be obtained from the discussion. Finally, Simkin shares the importance of nurturing employees who challenge ideas, assuming that they are sincere while identifying and celebrating the differences in each other.

01:15:00
In this section, Todd Simkin discusses the principles of the selection process and how they apply to hiring decisions. Simkin focuses on the idea of the "zone of proximal development," where a candidate is not just in their comfort zone or struggling to keep up, but in a place where with some support, they can do a little bit more. Through this evaluation, Simkin hopes to provide feedback for the candidate and see how they respond to it. Simkin emphasizes the importance of being open to feedback and using the tools available to succeed. He uses the example of his own interviews and constantly replaying them to improve his process. By approaching every situation with a desire to constantly improve and tweaking around the edges, Simkin believes that is where the most profitability lies, as it allows for continuous growth and adaptation.

01:20:00
In this section, Todd Simkin, a portfolio manager and investor, shares a personal story of quitting lacrosse in high school and how his father's response was an excellent example of good parenting. Instead of telling him what to do or not to do, his father challenged Todd to explain his reasoning, consider the long-term implications, and have a plan for what he would do with the extra time before making a final decision. This approach allowed Todd to think more deeply about his decision and ultimately realize that waiting and not quitting was the best option.

01:25:00
In this section, Todd Simkin reflects on a time when his father introduced him to the concept of long-term decision making by asking him to continue playing lacrosse for one more season before making any decisions. His father approached the situation with care, asking questions to understand Todd's perspective and goals before offering any guidance or advice. Todd now uses the same approach with his own children, asking them to tell him more so that he can provide context and support to help them make better decisions. This approach helps establish a collaborative and supportive relationship between parent and child, while also encouraging more thoughtful, deliberate decision making.

01:30:00
In this section, Todd Simkin talks about his struggles with determining his career path as a pre-med student, and the negative impact it had on him emotionally and academically. He describes engaging in unhealthy and self-destructive behavior, but eventually seeking support and finding the right therapist to guide him towards a better path. Simkin emphasizes the importance of demonstrating to the world that he was capable of learning, regardless of his chosen career path, and creating his own major in deaf culture and language. He also discusses how his experiences have allowed him to develop effective tools to help his loved ones cope with depression and other emotional struggles.

01:35:00
In this section, Todd Simkin discusses the double standard when it comes to seeking help from mental health professionals, as opposed to dentists and doctors. He explains that just as we take care of our physical health, we should also take care of our mental health. Simkin shares his experience of going on Jeopardy and how he was reminded by his chief risk manager to be careful when betting, as it was similar to how he makes decisions in his profession of putting money at risk. Finally, Simkin talks about lessons he learned from his parents, including the importance of kindness and treating others well, and the value of hard work and perseverance.

01:40:00
In this section, Todd Simkin discusses the values he learned from his parents, who put in a lot of hard work to provide their children with a good life and education. It was important for his parents that the children had access to education, even if it meant taking on more financial strain. Todd's parents also modeled love and acceptance, which he has passed on to his children. He always hugs and kisses his parents and greets them with love, which was not everyone's norm. Todd also talks about the importance of hard work, which his parents instilled in him. He later realized that his parents were working long hours because they valued education for their children.
