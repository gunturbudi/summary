In this section, Nancy Sherman, a philosopher and professor, discusses her journey to philosophy and how she ended up focusing on the connection between stoicism and the military. She shares that she was called up by the Naval Academy several decades ago to teach ethics following a massive cheating scandal, which led to her staying there for almost three years. During this time, she found herself teaching midshipmen who were veterans of the Vietnam War and who were familiar with stoicism as a way of dealing with deprivation. She also interviewed Jim Stockdale, a senior POW in the Hanoi Hilton, who had stumbled upon a book by Epictetus called the Handbook and found solace in stoicism during his captivity.

In this section, Nancy Sherman discusses how the concept of stoicism has been portrayed in different ways, including the idea of "embracing the suck" in the military. However, she argues that there is more to stoicism than just grit and self-reliance. Instead, she explores the idea of coordination and connectedness in stoicism, emphasizing the importance of living as cosmopolitan citizens of the universe. Additionally, she discusses her efforts to destigmatize mental health in the military and promote a gentler stoicism.

In this section, Nancy Sherman explains that the stoics have a sophisticated emotional theory made up of three levels of emotions. The first level consists of pre-emotions or proto-emotions such as shaping starts, startles, and nervous laughter, which are natural and adaptive. The second level of emotions can get you into trouble as these are full-throated anger, fear, resentment, revenge, chronic grief syndrome, and more. The stoics believe that these emotions need to be carefully handled as they can quickly derail you. The final level is where the stoics believe that recalibration of moral values happens, they are into the moral development of emotions, and calibrating emotional responses with one's values is crucial.

In this section, Dr. Nancy Sherman discusses the Stoics' concept of cultivating a good kind of fear and desire, which they call cautiousness and rational desire. By slowing down our reactions and filtering them through reason, we can avoid being stuck on negative emotions such as anger or desire. The Stoics suggest monitoring our impressions and observing our reactions as a way of regaining control over our emotions. Journaling can be a helpful tool in this process, as it allows us to analyze our responses in hindsight and learn from them. Achieving a state of calm, equitable, and serene emotions requires practice, but it is worth aspiring to.

can stop and reflect and think through your response rather than just reacting impulsively. This aligns with the Stoic philosophy of pressing the pause button and inserting space between initial input and reaction. Additionally, Sherman believes that writing helps us clarify our thinking and put words to our thoughts, making sense of our experiences. Psychotherapists have been doing this kind of talk therapy for centuries to help people sweep their thoughts and calm their emotions. While Sherman advocates for an eclectic approach that draws from various practices, she also acknowledges the value of Stoicism in helping individuals calm down and buy themselves time to respond thoughtfully.

00:25:00
In this section, philosopher Nancy Sherman discusses some techniques from Stoicism that can help people make better decisions. She mentions "pre-rehearsing the ills," which involves visualizing potential dangers or negative outcomes and mentally preparing for them. Other techniques include thinking ahead to potential issues to prevent being caught off guard and contemplating death as a way to prepare for the inevitability of mortality. She notes that while these practices may seem harsh or unemotional, they can help people manage their emotions in difficult situations. Additionally, she suggests a combination of Eastern and Western practices, such as mindfulness and journaling, to help individuals make better decisions.

00:30:00
In this section, philosopher and author Nancy Sherman discusses the Stoic approach to dealing with difficult situations, such as losing loved ones or experiencing business failure. She explains that the Stoics aim to prevent being blindsided and use techniques such as pre-rehearsing and dwelling in the future. Additionally, she discusses Aristotle's approach to making better decisions, which involves picturing future situations and keeping a complex picture in your head to determine what is truly best for you. The Stoics aim to reduce perturbation or disturbance through focusing on building good character and virtue, which they believe is sufficient for happiness and flourishing.

00:35:00
In this section, philosopher Nancy Sherman discusses the Stoic philosophy of focusing on virtue over external factors such as health, wealth, and political regime. The virtue is defined as the goodness of one's character, while other things are categorized as indifference. The Stoics emphasize that virtue is always good, while other goods are only situationally good or supporting roles. Being virtuous is a matter of being wise and knowing how to make the right choices despite external pressures. This philosophy is critical to remember as many people are driven by popularity, money, and glory, whereas virtue should be the only thing that matters for true happiness.

00:40:00
In this section, philosopher and author Nancy Sherman discusses the connection between honor and virtue in ancient Greek culture, and how it differs from modern society's view of honor and glory tied to status and wealth. She explains that Greek philosophers like Aristotle believed that honor and glory were derivative of one's virtue, whereas modern society often disconnects those concepts from their virtue. She also highlights the importance of directing human instincts towards achieving hierarchy through culture, philosophy, and religion rather than any means possible. Furthermore, she discusses the role that status and power play within society and how they affect individuals' behaviors.

00:45:00
In this section, philosopher Nancy Sherman discusses how power and authority can become abused and magnified in the military. While rank and hierarchy are necessary for military structures, they can also lead to divides across wealth, gender, and race. Sherman highlights the importance of thinking wisely about the roles we wear, as well as not deferring to the wrong people simply because of their identity. To build resilience, Sherman draws on the Stoics' belief in infallibility and mental reservation, which she explains as being adaptive to circumstances but not losing one's character and backbone in the process.

00:50:00
In this section, philosopher Nancy Sherman explains how the Stoic philosophy emphasizes the importance of being responsive to changing situations and developing the ability to refresh one's screen quickly in order to react as new information comes in. This means being open to different outcomes and not getting stuck on an attachment to a particular desired outcome or object. She also discusses how cognitive biases and the rush to achieve a desired outcome can lead to blind spots and limit one's ability to understand reality. The solution is to be aware of these tendencies and rely on groups of experts rather than solely on oneself or a siloed way of thinking.

00:55:00
In this section, philosopher Nancy Sherman discusses three key lessons: the importance of communication skills to break down silos and biases; the role of emotions in fueling commitment and creativity, and how emotions can be our friends and not just our enemies; and the necessity of listening to others in order to challenge our biases and confirm our assumptions. She emphasizes that true knowledge is collective and cooperative, and that getting out of our own silos requires understanding and cooperation across areas of expertise, bridging the gap through effective communication and an openness to learning from diverse perspectives.

01:00:00
In this section, Nancy Sherman discusses the importance of breaking down silos of expertise and being open to different perspectives. She emphasizes the need to want to see the world through another person's eyes and disassociate that from agreeing with how they see the world. However, she notes that some people approach the world with skepticism and a defense mechanism that requires sufficient evidence to remove doubt. Additionally, there is a struggle to bring different groups together and disentangle the power positions and politics involved. Despite the challenges, genuine engagement and openness can make a positive social difference beyond one's immediate community.

01:05:00
In this section, Nancy Sherman discusses the role of Stoicism in her personal life, including how to approach difficult conversations and the importance of expanding one's sense of community. She emphasizes the need for being mindful of the controllables in life, as well as the importance of visualization techniques and empathy-building practices. She also touches on the power of asking for help, citing Seneca's "Hercules Rages" as an example of a tragedy that can teach individuals to acknowledge their limitations and work with others to achieve their goals.

01:10:00
In this section, Nancy Sherman discusses the stoic lesson of taking on the perspective of another person to find self-compassion, using the story of Hercules as an example. After unintentionally killing his family in a blind rage, Hercules is comforted by opening himself up to someone else's perspective, ultimately learning to see himself through a more compassionate lens. This lesson is particularly relevant for military men and women dealing with survivor's guilt, as they may need the gaze of a close loved one or psychotherapist to hold up a mirror and allow them to see themselves in a different way.
