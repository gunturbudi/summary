In this section, Sarah Tavel discusses the importance of being a learning machine and constantly pushing oneself to grow and evolve as a founder or leader. She states that individuals who are not willing to admit they do not know something or do not allow themselves to have a learning moment tend to hold themselves back and not scale as a company scales. Tavel highlights the value of being vulnerable and finding different ways of learning, such as surrounding oneself with CEOs that are a step ahead or finding coaches. Later in the interview, Tavel discusses how her study of philosophy and the intellectual rigor she learned has helped her in her career as a VC and in making investment recommendations.

She believes in constantly injecting founder-type DNA into a company throughout the life cycle of the company, particularly through talent acquisitions. Tavel emphasizes the importance of ensuring all people in a company, not just founders, are aligned with the mission to be successful. She explains that people who care about the identity of the company may get frustrated if the management team does not adequately reward those who lean in and give everything to make the company successful.

In this section, Sarah Tavel discusses the concept of cash flow and burn for tech companies, addressing the concern about companies that don't seem to generate cash for shareholders. Tavel argues that investing money up front in sales and marketing may lead to long-term profitability and positive returns for investors. She also emphasizes the importance of companies that can escape competition and become incredibly profitable, but acknowledges that competition necessitates investing heavily in sales and product in order to stay ahead. Tavel suggests that early evidence of expanding contribution margins, evidence of improvement, and understanding of numeracy on the founder's part are crucial in determining whether a company has a viable product and can generate returns.

In this section, Sarah Tavel emphasizes the importance of confronting the brutal facts in business and making decisions based on key metrics. As a board member of various companies, Tavel stresses that it is essential to focus on one primary metric to measure business health and success. She also discusses the concept of the net present value of pain, where she reminds founders that postponing painful decisions eventually compounds the problem and leads to cascading effects. Additionally, Tavel refers to Reed Hoffman's idea that every strength has a corresponding weakness and highlights the advantages and disadvantages of both centralized and decentralized organizational structures.

In this section, Sarah Tavel discusses how acknowledging one's own strength and weakness, as well as those of the team, is crucial to the success of a founder. She highlights that when identifying people who are not scaling in their roles, it is essential to find the early warning signs that there are problems on the horizon. Sarah also notes that self-awareness is a vital component of identifying strengths and weaknesses, and that founders need to be continuously learning to grow and evolve their abilities. Finally, she evaluates the idea of not giving another role to someone who doesn't' fit the role, saying it is right 95% of the time.

In this section, Sarah Tavel discusses the challenge of transferring employees who are no longer suitable for their current roles, particularly those who rate as sevens out of ten in the organization's assessment. She notes that those who fall into this category can often have compelling qualities, such as cultural acumen, that make them harder to demote or move out. However, the opportunity cost of keeping such employees can be considerable, as having weaker performers on board can bring down the execution of the team, potentially causing cascading problems. Therefore, Tavel advises founders to be rigorous and have conviction when it comes to transferring sevens or worse out of their roles, as avoiding difficult conversations is not a viable option. Another important point she makes is about board members' roles and how critical it is that they share the founder's vision and mission. Additionally, they shouldn't function as cheerleaders but should have the courage and judgment to push the founder when required.

00:35:00
In this section, Sarah Tavel discusses the importance of trust in the relationship between a board and a founder. She notes that the breakdown of trust can occur when the founder is not fully transparent with the board, or when the board is not acting in the best interest of the company. Tavel suggests that it is important for the board to have a 10,000-foot view of the company, while also considering the founder's perspective. When assessing the judgment of a CEO or other C-level executives, Tavel looks for factors such as their ability to make quick and informed decisions and their willingness to admit mistakes and address them.

00:40:00
In this section, Sarah Tavel talks about her process for decision-making, starting with understanding a company by interacting with the CEO, analyzing the board deck and other available information provided. She emphasizes the importance of all parties reasoning from the same premises to reach the same conclusion, and if not, identifying any blind spots or lack of judgement to make informed decisions. Tavel also discusses her structured way of thinking and personal mental models, such as the "Hierarchy of Engagement" and the concept of enduring value, which both play a significant role in her decision-making process. Finally, she emphasizes the importance of opportunity cost in her investment decisions, which Benchmark takes into account by not scaling their business.

00:45:00
In this section, Sarah Tavel explains how, as a board member, she and her partners are committed to being the hardest working and most impactful members around the table. She emphasizes the importance of opportunity cost when making investments and how she thinks about escaping competition in the companies she invests in. Sarah spends a lot of time looking at companies with network effects or marketplaces because she recognizes that once you tip a market with a network effect, the space between you and the competition just gets wider and wider. Another type of company she likes is one that goes after a space that is underestimated from the outside, inviting less competition.

00:50:00
In this section of the video, venture capitalist Sarah Tavel discusses the importance of starting in a small market and executing well to achieve success. She explains that markets are like rivers and startups need to be like canoes that ride the current to build something valuable. Tavel also shares insights on the mistakes she sees CEOs make that increase the odds of failure, such as letting ambition blind them in not picking a small starting place to execute well. She uses the example of Postmates and DoorDash to emphasize the importance of generating contrast and being the best player in a market with weaker competition to create value.

00:55:00
In this section, Sarah Tavel discusses the different strategies used by Postmates and DoorDash to enter the food delivery market. While Postmates focused on expanding the supply side by providing delivery for any type of business, DoorDash targeted the suburbs where there was less competition and easier access to restaurants. Tavel notes that DoorDash's strategy of focusing on a smaller market first helped them to optimize for tipping the market, leading to greater success in the long run. She also explains how the idea of mastering difficult conditions first before targeting easier ones can apply to various industries.

In this section, Sarah Tavel discusses the concept of tipping a market and maximizing for organic growth by picking something that is easy to win. She explains how Amazon was able to articulate a flywheel clearly and become successful by not spending money on acquisition and instead making their margin off of a vast inventory. Tavel also discusses the vulnerabilities of being a horizontal platform like eBay and how new startups like Goat are unbundling such companies by providing a better user experience. She believes that the number one thing that leads to failure is complacency and warns against not paying attention to new disruptors.

01:05:00
In this section, Sarah Tavel discusses how the sneaker marketplace Goat was founded. After the founder received a pair of counterfeit sneakers from eBay, he realized the vulnerability of the marketplace and saw an opportunity to create a company that could vet inventory to ensure authenticity. Goat went after the vulnerability of the sneaker market by creating a mobile-first product with features that eBay couldn't compete with, effectively disrupting their business model. Tavel concludes that in the world of startups, there is only the possibility of bundling and unbundling markets through creative destruction, which is a unique aspect of the industry.
