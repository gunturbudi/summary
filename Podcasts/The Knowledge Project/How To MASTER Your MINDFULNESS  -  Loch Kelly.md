Loch Kelly, in his video on mastering mindfulness, shares his personal journey of discovering mindfulness and how it led him to effortless mindfulness. He explains the different levels of awareness and the benefits of transitioning to a more selfless operating system that allows individuals to relieve suffering by seeing and being with anxious and sad feelings without identifying with them. Kelly explains how effortless mindfulness differs from being a mindful witness and how it opens up and looks at the meditator behind the camera. He discusses the interconnected nature of thoughts, feelings, and sensations, and shares various practices such as the unique glimpsing practice, unhooking awareness, and dropping into an open mind and open heart space. He also elaborates the different levels of mind and the benefits of true nature or bodhichitta, which fosters positive qualities, compassion, and a feeling of safety and friendliness.
Loch Kelly in this video discusses the levels of consciousness, specifically the awakened consciousness that is freeing and loving. He encourages viewers to use his method of glimpsing to access the already awake awareness that is timeless and contentless, which can be life-changing. Kelly also talks about happiness, distinguishing between small h happiness and big H happiness which is a sense of freedom and awakeness. He emphasizes that happiness is the natural condition of every person and stems from their essential nature. Kelly notes the difficulty in teaching others how to reach a state of wordless awareness but emphasizes that this awareness can be integrated into daily life with practice and willingness to retrain oneself.

In this section, Loch Kelly recounts his early experiences with mindfulness, which involved playing sports and discovering a way to open his awareness and drop into his body. He explains that this led to a feeling of being in the flow or the zone, which made him feel more capable and interconnected with everything. When he shared his experience with a friend, he was given a book on zen and archery, which further piqued his interest in mindfulness. Kelly became more interested in learning about mindfulness and exploring its benefits, which led him on a path to discover effortless mindfulness.

In this section, Loch Kelly talks about his journey in exploring meditation and mindfulness, which began during his college years. He combined principles of meditation with psychology, neuroscience, and spirituality, and even traveled to Sri Lanka, India, and Nepal to study with teachers and ask questions. He defines different levels of awareness, starting with attention, moving to mindfulness where one can observe their own thoughts and debug their brain. This leads to effortless mindfulness, where one looks back at the awareness itself to realize it is at the core of their being.

00:10:00
In this section of the video, Kelly discusses the concept of content-less awareness, which is pure, alert consciousness that is not orienting consciously to thought, but is conscious of the room, in a sense almost like an ocean of awareness arising as experience. This awake awareness arises into different types of consciousness, such as hearing and thinking consciousness, as aspects of it. The usefulness of separating content-less awareness from thought is that one can open up one's mind and feel connected to others, leading to an effortlessly mindful and selfless state known as a panoramic flow state. Although some may believe one must spend 30,000 hours or join a monastery to reach this state, Kelly suggests that this consciousness is already available to anyone, and one just needs a figure-ground shift to become aware of it.

00:15:00
In this section of the video, Loch Kelly explains that the most common reason people practice mindfulness is to access a greater capacity for awareness-based, embodied, and open-ended thinking. This upgrade to the operating system involves transitioning from a small sense of self to a larger selflessness that allows individuals to relieve suffering by seeing and being with anxious and sad feelings, instead of identifying with them. The ego-centered view is characterized by emotions being bigger than the ego, which amplifies negative feelings, whereas glimpses of this open-hearted, awake consciousness result in positive experiences, such as love, peace, joy, relief, and freedom. The practices discussed in the video primarily involve glimpses and small steps to help people familiarize themselves with this new operating system, leading to a developmental stage where they can respond rather than react to situations.

00:20:00
In this section, Loch Kelly explains that many of the current psychotherapy models are parts-based systems, where people realize there are different parts of themselves, such as sad or angry parts, and a judging part. The key is to become aware of these parts through basic mindfulness and then through spacious and pervasive open-hearted awareness. Kelly advises that the ego doesn't need to be killed or fought, as it's a functional part of the human psyche that forms around thoughts, feelings, sensations, and views. By stepping back and dialoguing with the ego, it can be seen as one perspective rather than the center of everything. This approach frees individuals to be more creative and joyful and not always compare and contrast dualistic views.

00:25:00
In this section, Loch Kelly discusses the notion of well-being and how it doesn't always have to come from external events or circumstances. He then outlines two approaches to managing anxiety: basic training and psychotherapy. Basic training focuses on finding a sense of calm through practices such as deep breathing, while psychotherapy involves locating and physicalizing the anxiety, giving it a voice and a felt sense. Ultimately, both approaches are centered on finding a more spacious, open-hearted awareness that transcends anxious thoughts and feelings.

00:30:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the concept of effortless mindfulness and how it differs from simply being a mindful witness. He explains that while mindfulness-based psychotherapy allows individuals to establish a mindful witness and detach from their thoughts and feelings, effortless mindfulness opens up and looks at the meditator who is behind the camera of the mindful witness. By doing so, one is able to tap into a natural alertness that already exists without needing conscious effort. This natural awareness has a softness and wisdom to it, which can be helpful when dealing with anxious thoughts or feelings.

00:35:00
In this section, Loch Kelly discusses the interconnected nature of thoughts, feelings, and sensations in the mind, which arise like a quantum field. Rather than being detached, this mode of mindfulness invites an embracing connection to these experiences to create a sense of calm and intelligence. This method allows one to connect with a deeper field of consciousness that is non-anxious and non-fearful. To access this state in stressful situations, Loch recommends learning the unique glimpsing practice, which involves unhooking awareness from the thinker or worrier and dropping it into the heart space or moving from thinking to seeing to hearing to create an inclusive, effortless awareness. This way of learning can take the same amount of time as basic or deliberate mindfulness, but the benefits have been reported to be effective in stabilizing and calming the mind.

00:40:00
Loch Kelly shares in this section is a way to shift one's consciousness and move awareness from something in front of them to the space around and then to the side of their head where sound is coming from. By doing this, one can rest and receive while being aware of one's surroundings in a manner that opens up the mind, calms the body, and enhances creativity while keeping one alert and non-thought-based. This method can help unhook or step back from one's thought-based self and shift to an observing point of view that would allow one to be aware of their thoughts without identifying with them.

00:45:00
In this section, Loch Kelly explains the benefits of unhooking our awareness and dropping into an open mind, open heart space. He suggests that when we open our awareness to a spacious view, the interior singular cortex of the brain relaxes, which results in a clear and palpable felt sense of unhooking into this open space of the heart mind. He guides the listener through a meditation exercise where one drops their awareness down to different parts of the body, ultimately landing in the middle of the chest in a heart space. From here, one can access a more open mind and open heart without being oriented to thought.

00:50:00
In this section, Loch Kelly explains a method of unhooking or disengaging from thoughts and emotions by noticing them without being attached to them. He suggests finding a glimpse practice that works best for an individual's learning style. Kelly also talks about the three levels of mind: shift of identity, shift of knowing, and shift of perception. He further elaborates on the five levels of mind: everyday mind, mindful witness/subtle mind, heart mind, essence mind, and non-dual awakening. He explains that most meditation systems stop at the subtle mind level.

00:55:00
In this section, Loch Kelly discusses the four levels of mind. The first level is the wandering mind, where thoughts are scattered and driven by impulses. The second, detached witness, involves mindfulness and a more basic level of awareness. The third level is the unique and effortless awake awareness that is contentless, timeless, and boundless. It is a flow of consciousness that can be trained or recognized through direct pathways to identify this nature of mind. The fourth level, the unity of awake awareness, is described as emptiness, where interconnectedness should be the term used. Finally, the fifth level is true nature or bodhichitta, also called open-hearted awareness, where positive qualities are fostered, and there is a compassionate flow, non-reactivity, and a feeling of safety and friendliness.

01:00:00
In this section of the video, Loch Kelly discusses the different levels of consciousness and how many people stop at stress management when it comes to meditation. He claims that there is an awakened consciousness that is freeing and loving, but most people do not push themselves to get there. Kelly encourages his viewers to use his method of glimpsing to access the already awake awareness that is timeless and contentless. He mentions the potential of this method and how it can be life-changing for people. Kelly ends the discussion by talking about happiness and how there is small h happiness, which is finding pleasure and satisfaction, and there is big H happiness, which is a sense of freedom and awakeness.

01:05:00
In this section, Loch Kelly explains that happiness is the natural condition of every person, with a sense of well-being that stems from their essential nature. Most people are unhappy because their small ego center functions as the operating system, and they use anxiety or depression to manage their emotions. However, if people learn how to shift their mindset to this essential nature, their lives will be filled with relief, joy, happiness, and freedom because there is no fear. Love is the fabric of this dimension of self, and it is not a mental state. Instead, it is the foundation of people's beings and allows them to function optimally and creatively, giving them a kind of love and joy that feels like ecstasy or bliss.

01:10:00
In this section of the video, Loch Kelly discusses the difficulty in teaching others how to reach a state of wordless awareness and interconnectedness in mindfulness practice. He notes that even individuals who experience these states may not have the proper framework or understanding of what they are experiencing. Kelly emphasizes that this awareness is not a product of meditation or retreat, but rather something that can be integrated into daily life with practice and the willingness to retrain oneself. He also provides his website and resources for individuals interested in learning more about his approach to mindfulness.
