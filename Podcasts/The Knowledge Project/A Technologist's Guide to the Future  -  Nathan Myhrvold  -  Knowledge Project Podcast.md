In this section, Nathan Myhrvold discusses his time at Microsoft and the decision-making principles he used. He explains that they tried to be as analytical and careful as possible but were also willing to change their minds if needed. They were operating in a fast-changing environment during the personal computer revolution, which was not yet taken for granted. Myhrvold emphasizes the importance of monitoring decisions and adjusting course if necessary.

00:05:00
In this section, Nathan Myhrvold talks about the evolution of computing, from the slogan back in the day that there should be a computer on every desk and in every home, to the concept of having one in every pocket now. He notes that cars today are essentially computers with wheels and change in performance is as simple as a new chip. While predictions in the short run are easier to make, long-term predictions become more difficult, like the concept of interstellar travel without computers. Nathan talks about autonomous systems and their moral implications, noting that while they are currently not as good as human drivers, it wouldnâ€™t take long before they surpass our driving abilities.

00:10:00
In this section, Nathan Myhrvold discusses the pushback against using drones for aerial combat despite their superiority over human pilots due to the latter's inability to withstand as many G-forces as missiles. Myhrvold believes that the manned space program has become a reality TV show, and there is no reason to take fragile humans into space when machines can easily do the job without the need for complex systems to keep humans alive. He argues that it is cheaper, easier, and more effective to explore the solar system with machines rather than humans. Though people believe colonizing the solar system is an imperative, he thinks it is a holdover from the age of imperialism when conquering and colonizing the whole world was thought to be necessary.

00:15:00
In this section, Nathan Myhrvold discusses human's history of colonization and how it reflects our inability to take care of the planet in a sustainable way. He argues that while some believe that the solution is to colonize other planets, it would be better to take better care of our planet and not treat it as disposable. However, humans are not great at long-term behaviors, and our tendency towards immediate gratification often leads us to engage in self-destructive behaviors. Climate change is a particularly difficult problem to solve because it is global and long-term, which makes it harder for us to demonstrate a sense of responsibility and take action to combat it.

00:20:00
In this section, Nathan Myhrvold talks about the mindset that led to bad forestry practices, wherein small fires were stopped, leaving tons of fuel for bigger fires to develop. He stresses that this bias is deeply ingrained, and it will be difficult to shift. He further notes that the biggest problem is climate change and the lack of action taken to mitigate it. Myhrvold points out that even with the admirable work done on renewables, the world's growing economy makes up for their efforts, primarily because of the coal plants built mainly in China and India. Every year, CO2 measurements on top of Mauna Kea get higher, which means that we've made no progress in tackling climate change. To make progress, we need to either create a technology superior to fossil fuels or start taking climate change seriously.

00:25:00
In this section, Nathan Myhrvold discusses how the world's reliance on natural gas as a reliable and clean source of energy is no longer as viable as it once seemed. He explains that while the gas industry claims that natural gas produces half the greenhouse gases that coal does, gas leakage, specifically methane, is a far more significant contributor to global warming. Furthermore, the instability in the world's politics and economy makes it difficult for countries like Europe to make significant progress towards renewable energy. Human nature, such as jealousy and procrastination, also hinder progress towards achieving sustainability.

00:30:00
In this section, Myhrvold discusses the importance of prioritizing diseases that pose a daily threat, such as building fires, over those that may only occur once every hundred years. He cites the example of fire sprinklers, which are installed in most modern buildings despite the low probability of a building burning down on any given day. Myhrvold then draws parallels to the COVID-19 pandemic, asserting that although the likelihood of a pandemic occurring in a given year may be low, its impact on modern society can be profound due to modern transportation and logistics. Additionally, he warns of the potential consequences of bioterrorism, stating that it could be much cheaper and easier to execute than more traditional modes of warfare, creating the need for greater preparation and response capabilities.

00:35:00
In this section, the speaker talks about the development of mRNA vaccines, which have allowed for the creation of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in record time with remarkable efficacy. However, the speaker then transitions to discussing climate change, predicting that there will come a day when society panics about climate change, but stopping all emissions on that day would not be enough to immediately stop the effects of climate change due to the longevity of CO2 in the atmosphere. The speaker concludes by mentioning that it is hard to predict what will cause society to panic about climate change.

00:40:00
In this section, Nathan Myhrvold explains how geoengineering could be a possible technological fix to combat global warming. He provides a detailed explanation of the Earth's primary source of heat and how enhanced CO2 emissions trap heat in the atmosphere, compounding every year. However, Myhrvold suggests that if we could make the sun just one percent dimmer, it would solve the problem. Natural things like clouds and ice help reflect sunlight, but geoengineering can directly combat global warming. While people are hesitant about geoengineering due to its potential consequences, Myhrvold explains what geoengineering entails and how it could be a solution to global warming.

00:45:00
In this section, Nathan Myhrvold discusses the concept of geoengineering as a potential solution to combat global warming. He suggests that reflecting enough sunlight back into space through measures like painting white roads and white roofs could make a small difference. However, to significantly impact global temperatures, particles would need to be put in the upper atmosphere, like what occurs during volcanic eruptions. This method, called solar radiation management, is a form of geoengineering that could have second-order consequences, but Myhrvold argues that many of the major advancements in human history have been accompanied by new problems. The fear is that geoengineering may be seen as an easy way out and may cause people to neglect the hard decisions needed to combat global warming.

00:50:00
In this section, Nathan Myhrvold discusses how the solution to past ecological problems has often led to new problems, and how geoengineering is a tool that should be used only in extreme circumstances. He also talks about the global cooperation needed to tackle climate change, but admits that there is no way to force other nations to follow suit, especially if they feel that they deserve to use fossil fuels to improve their standard of living. Myhrvold also emphasizes the need to address the issue of mobility addiction, citing how people accept car accidents as a normal occurrence but are outraged by murders.

00:55:00
In this section, the interviewer asks Nathan Myhrvold what he wishes he knew earlier in life. Myhrvold struggles to come up with a single example but mentions that he should have shorted Lehman Brothers in 2008 and gone long on Peloton before the pandemic. However, he admits that this kind of second-guessing is not helpful. He believes that if there was nothing he wished he knew, then he hadn't grown as a person. Eventually, he concludes that something will come to his mind later in life that he wished he'd known earlier.
