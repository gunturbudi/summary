Dr. Andrew Huberman explains in this video why people may wake up at 3AM and how to fix it. He suggests getting enough physical exercise and advises 150 to 180 minutes of zone 2 cardio and resistance exercise per week. Going to bed earlier if melatonin is causing people to fall asleep too early and wake up too early can be helpful as well. He emphasizes that our systems were built for going to bed shortly after the sun goes down and explains that sleeping before midnight can be more effective at recharging the body than sleeping after midnight. He cautions against taking melatonin supplements due to their potential negative impact on the body's hormone system.

In this section, the speaker discusses the benefits of sleeping before midnight and why it may be more effective at recharging the body than sleeping after midnight. However, many people go to bed late, wake up early, and try to go back to sleep with the help of their phones, which can actually prevent them from getting enough rest and cause them to work at a lower capacity throughout the day. Furthermore, the speaker advises against taking melatonin supplements due to its potential impact on the body's hormone system, particularly in suppressing the onset of puberty and natural hormone levels for both sexes.
