In this section, Jim Collins talks about leadership and how it cannot necessarily be taught, but it can be learned through embracing the idea of what needs to be done and exercising the art of getting people to want to join you in getting it done. Good leadership, according to Eisenhower, is an art of getting people to want to do what must be done, but it starts with the clarity of recognizing that something has to be done and taking responsibility for leading the effort. Collins shares a story about a superintendent who takes responsibility for increasing graduation rates and creates a program to bring back the students who didn't finish high school, showing what it takes to be a great leader.

In this section, the speaker offers two lessons on how to become a great leader. First, do not be a bystander but rather get others to join you in taking action when something needs to be done. He emphasizes that leadership is an art form and that one should aim to inspire and motivate others rather than just admonishing or copying them. Second, he recommends that instead of caring only for one's career, one should care for their people because if they do so, the people will not let them fail. The speaker considers context as an important element in leadership situations, but he believes that good leaders can be effective across various contexts. Heâ€™s optimistic about the future of leadership because he has seen many young leaders emerge with great potential.

In this section, the podcast discusses the qualities of a great leader as explained by Jennifer Garvey Berger, an expert in leadership ability. She highlights that great leaders have a presence that makes other people feel bigger and better. A charismatic leader may make others feel good about them, but a great leader amplifies those around them and helps them feel more comfortable to take risks or say controversial things, allowing creativity and morality to flow freely. Garvey Berger distinguishes the fundamental difference between kinds of leadership, suggesting that the world today is calling for leaders who can create the conditions that enable everyone to be bigger, smarter, more creative, more moral, essentially, just plain better.

00:15:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the qualities that make a great leader, which include amplification and curiosity about the world and other people's perspectives. A leader who is too certain about their beliefs may not be open to feedback and may miss the warning signs of a potential disaster. However, the speaker notes that in politics, the addiction to sound bites and the emphasis on simplistic problem-solving can lead to bigger problems. The speaker also discusses feedback and how great leaders carry messages, offering criticism in a way that is useful and applicable universally. The speaker distinguishes between technique and routine, noting that techniques or useful ideas for feedback may not work all the time in different situations.

00:20:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the importance of bringing certain behaviors into routine rather than using them as techniques. He notes that one of the behaviors that leaders should strive to make habitual is giving feedback that is balanced between positive and negative aspects, rather than offering excessive criticism. The speaker provides an example of two different types of feedback on a hypothetical presentation, one that is mostly negative, and one that is balanced, stating that most people would prefer the latter. By making feedback a routine, it can become a habit and come more naturally, rather than feeling forced or insincere.

00:25:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the importance of balance in relationships, specifically the balance of positive and negative feedback. The speaker notes that the best leaders start with a positive focus, and the level of detail and elaboration in the positive must be equal to that of the negative. The balance between positive and negative feedback must be somewhat imbalanced, but not overwhelmingly so. If a relationship has too little positive feedback, people withdraw and stop listening or become defensive. On the other hand, if the balance is too positive, people get alarmed when they receive negative feedback. A good balance of feedback is necessary for preparing children for success and for good relationships.

00:30:00
In this section, the speaker emphasizes the importance of balancing positive and negative feedback in relationships, particularly in critical moments where feedback is necessary. Great coaches, dance instructors, and corporate leaders all tend to balance feedback, which is why their feedback is often accepted differently. The speaker advises starting to balance feedback in all of our relationships by making positive remarks as vivid and elaborate as negative remarks. He also shares an example of a critical moment in his leadership when he received feedback about a low-quality menu item in Argentina but was able to take that feedback, adjust the menu, and improve the situation. The speaker highlights the value of assuming that criticism is correct and then responding productively to it.

In this segment, a former Hooters marketing employee shares an experience where she made a difficult ethical decision to prioritize the well-being of customers and employees over marketing goals. Although her decision was backed by many executives, she received backlash from a high-level company member who believed it was not her job to initiate such changes. However, the employee found support from her mentor who advised her to continue advocating for what is right and gave her the resilience to handle similar situations in the future. Moreover, the podcast discusses the elements of a great leader and how they can work together to create a successful business environment, including principles and practices, governance processes, leadership teams, and creating value roadmaps. It emphasizes the importance of coaching and facilitating, leading with humility, love, service, courage, discipline, resilience, civility, and authenticity.

In this section, a former CEO of Boeing explains the importance of having a self-reinforcing system in place for success. He breaks down five key elements, such as strategy and performance management, and emphasizes the necessity of holding oneself and others accountable for following the process. As a leader, it is vital to align oneself with the team and facilitate and coach them towards the same goals. The focus should be on expected behaviors that become more visible overtime and the gradual alignment of one's beliefs, values, and behaviors. This authenticity leads to positive performance and natural feedback loops that keep everyone on track.

00:45:00
In this section, Alan Mulally discusses how good behaviors lead to good decision-making, describing a process he used with his own family to bring structure and organization to their lives. He emphasizes that the process of continuously implementing good behaviors is what ultimately makes people great leaders in all aspects of their lives, whether in business or at home. Mulally offers humble leadership as an example of a good behavior and points to the importance of exhibiting these behaviors in practice, thereby making good decision-making a concerted effort.

00:50:00
In this section, family and business coach Diana Chapman discusses the importance of practicing candor and giving feedback to others, even if it might not be easy. She suggests a practice of sharing the facts and stories we make up about others in order to encourage honest communication and create a more productive team or family dynamic. By asking questions like "how is it true?" rather than "is it true?", individuals can learn from others' feedback and become more effective decision makers. Chapman's approach has been successful in helping teens and teams learn more about each other in a safe and positive environment, leading to valuable feedback and personal growth.

00:55:00
In this section, the speaker shares her favorite tip to teach teams: fact and story. When a group of leaders was struggling to make a decision on whether to sell their company, the speaker suggested that they share their facts and stories. By doing so, they were able to challenge each other's perceptions and come to a clearer understanding of the situation. The speaker emphasizes that making the invisible visible is important for a better outcome and personal growth.
