Social psychologist Emily Balcetis explains in the Knowledge Project Podcast how our visual experiences influence our motivation to set and achieve goals, and how our perception plays a critical role in this process. Our physical construction limits our perception of the world around us, leading us to make incomplete assumptions about what is true. Balcetis emphasizes how understanding how our brains and bodies operate is crucial in forming better habits that can help us achieve our goals. By inducing a perception reality gap, we can create an opportunity for self-deception and trickery that can work to our advantage. The key takeaway is evaluating personal commitment levels towards a goal to determine the most effective motivational strategy.
Emily Balcetis discusses the concept of negativity dominance and how people tend to ruminate on negative experiences more than positive ones due to the evolutionary need to be attuned to threats. She suggests actively working to circumvent this natural tendency by making positive experiences outweigh the negative ones. Balcetis also talks about how we can shape our environment to influence our behavior, such as reducing the visual accessibility of unhealthy foods. She emphasizes the importance of setting realistic goals, planning for setbacks, and shifting the focus to process-based goals. Additionally, she stresses the need for patience and compartmentalization to cope with stress and competing priorities, and defines success as being happy, appreciating what one has, and avoiding social comparisons.

In this section, social psychologist Emily Balcetis discusses the link between focus and motivation, and how people's perceptions of the world can influence their ability to set and reach their goals. She explains how our visual experiences are often misrepresentations, with our eager mind filling in the gaps without our awareness. Balcetis emphasizes the importance of understanding how our brains and bodies operate to help us form better habits, such as leaving our running shoes in a more visible location to remind us to exercise. The episode also delves into the unique nature of vision and how the lack of feedback and updating contributes to our perception gap.

In this section, Emily Balcetis talks about how our physical construction impacts our perception of the world around us. Our eyes are directed forward, unlike prey animals like horses that have eyes on the sides of their heads, which provide a broader field of view. This means we're missing many details in our peripheral vision and only taking in a narrow subset of information with precise clarity, while the rest remains fuzzy. Although our brains have created an efficient algorithm to make sense of this information efficiently, we need to acknowledge that significant parts of what we believe to be true can be incomplete. Therefore, it's essential to recognize our physical limitations' impact and embrace asterisks next to much of what we believe to be facts.

00:10:00
In this section, Emily Balcetis discusses the science behind how our perception influences our behavior and actions. Our brains prioritize visual input over auditory or tactile input based on the neurological real estate in our cortex. Balcetis also talks about the perception gap and how this idea was a fundamental misunderstanding on her part about existing literature on how people's visual experiences vary in the same context, which has been theorized for hundreds of years. With advancements in technology and scientific understanding, researchers can study these questions more accurately and precisely using methods such as eye-tracking and retina sensors.

In this section, Emily Balcetis discusses her research on the relationship between what we see and our motivation to accomplish goals. She explains that while motivation is important, it is not always enough to push people to achieve their goals. Balcetis and her team found that people with a higher waist-to-hip ratio and BMI tend to perceive distance as farther than people with lower measures, making it harder for them to navigate the space. However, highly motivated people, regardless of their body type, can see the distance in a way that makes it easier to achieve their goals. These findings suggest that our visual experience is not just reflective of the world around us but also influenced by what our body is capable of doing and what our brain can supplement.

00:20:00
In this section, Emily Balcetis discusses how she discovered that successful athletes have a hyper focus approach when running. They tend to ignore all their peripheral vision and concentrate on the target they set for themselves, making their path narrower. Balcetis tested this approach and found that people who followed it and exercised accordingly walked 23% faster, felt 17% less pain and started exercising more frequently. This approach is not magic, it's about changing people's psychology which influences their visual experience, leading to psychological consequences. When people feel that the finish line is closer, they tend to adopt a more positive mindset and find it easier to achieve their goals.

00:25:00
In this section, Emily Balcetis discusses how our perception of proximity affects our motivation and performance towards a goal. By inducing a perception reality gap, we can create an opportunity for self-deception and trickery that can work to our advantage. When focusing on exercise goals, people face difficulties in the middle, where the goal seems ambiguous and there are competing goals and obstacles. It is found that people can achieve a burst of motivation by looking forwards towards the finish line, while others may be more motivated by looking at how far they have come. The key takeaway is to recognize the different options available in goal-setting and to evaluate personal commitment levels towards a goal to determine the most effective motivational strategy.

00:30:00
In this section, Emily Balcetis discusses how people who have already achieved a goal may need to sustain the changes that they made to maintain it for a long time, especially with fitness or health goals. She also talks about the frequency of using narrowed attention versus wider attention in athletes setting sub-goals during a 5K race. According to her studies, people who already perform well tend to use more narrowed attention as they approach the finish line, and this strategy is correlated with high performance. However, other distractions such as competition or supporters may widen attention and distract from the goal.

00:35:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the goal gradient hypothesis, which suggests that when individuals are closer to the finish line of achieving their goals, their pace and motivation increase. The speaker notes that this theory was first explored through the study of rats and mice in mazes, where the animals were often motivated by being deprived of food and water before being rewarded with a treat at the end of the maze. The speaker suggests that setting sub-goals can help individuals see the end goal as more achievable, as it changes their cognitive thinking about the difficulty of the task. By perceiving the goal to be more manageable, individuals can find the energy and motivation to take the next step.

00:40:00
In this section, the speaker talks about the idea of creating vision boards by collecting visuals that reflect a person's ideal life. It is important to have concrete steps to achieve the goals in the vision board, think through the obstacles that could arise along the way, and prepare backup plans for those obstacles. This ensures that the planning sessions are coupled with concrete action planning, and one is prepared to move forward with their goals. It is essential to have a mental map of what the goals look like, pivot, and know the next steps to achieve the goal efficiently.

In this section, the example of Michael Phelps is highlighted as proof of the effectiveness of visualizing potential failure and having a backup plan in place. Phelps would practice and prepare with his coach for the possibility of his goggles failing during competition. When it happened at the 2008 Olympics, he turned to his backup plan of counting strokes to finish the race and ended up winning eight gold medals in a single Olympiad, the first Olympian to ever achieve this feat. The story emphasizes the importance not only of having a backup plan but also practicing it to make it an effective strategy. Additionally, Balcetis explains the importance of keeping obstacles, backup plans, and progress accessible when pursuing goals.

00:50:00
In this section, Emily Balcetis discusses the importance of strategic planning and time allocation when it comes to achieving personal goals. She explains how she designed an experiment with her team with the goal of finding enough time to work on big projects that would require daily persistence but would not lead to quick results. The experiment had people think about a goal that they were working towards and plan out the next seven days in advance, scheduling in times in their calendar for when they might be able to work on a particular task to achieve this big goal. At the end of every day, they reported on the amount of time they had worked on their goals, and the findings showed that people who planned their time a week in advance found two and a half more hours to work on their goal compared to those who thought about their day. Balcetis explains why this strategy was effective for 66% of people in her team.

00:55:00
In this section, Balcetis discusses the relationship between time, goal-setting, and how we structure our schedules. She notes that planning further out can increase productivity and hold us more accountable. Additionally, when we are further removed from a task, we begin to think more about what we want to do rather than what is feasible right now. Balcetis also mentions self-consistency theory, which suggests that we want to hold consistent understandings of who we are. Lastly, she discusses that there is research indicating a relationship between visual perception and certain mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression. People with these conditions are more likely to fixate on the source of their fear.

In this section, Emily Balcetis discusses the idea of negativity dominance and why people tend to ruminate on negative experiences more than the positive ones. She believes that negative experiences pack a bigger hedonic punch, and that stems from the idea that we needed to be attuned to threats to stay alive. People have come to expect that moving forward and it shapes their belief system. However, some people notice this and actively work to circumvent this natural tendency by working on making positive experiences outweigh the negative ones. Balcetis suggests that people with a half full-half empty mentality aren't wrong, but it is based on different sets of expectations and memories leading to a different belief system. Finally, she speaks about how people can shape their environment to impact their behavior in terms of visual perception. For example, if you use a smaller plate, it nudges you towards a more desired behavior of putting lesser food on the plate.

01:05:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the concept of contrast and surrounds and how they can change our perception of something. She uses her mother's experience after having her stomach removed as an example and how she has to eat small portions, but tricks her brain into believing it's a full meal by using small plates or a teacup saucer. The speaker also talks about how we can use environmental illusions to influence our behavior, such as visual sparks and crafting a visual environment that encourages the habits we want to develop. For example, if we want to eat less unhealthy foods, we can reduce their visual accessibility, which can lead to reduced consumption patterns as demonstrated by experiments at Google and the Massachusetts General Hospital cafeteria.

01:10:00
In this section, the speaker discusses how we can use visual cues to achieve our goals more effectively. For example, we can set up our environment in a way that nudges us to achieve our goals, such as leaving our running shoes near the door to remind us to go for a run. Additionally, we can use tools such as charts or reward systems to hold ourselves more accountable and accurately track our progress. It's important to set sub-goals and to be creative about what constitutes success, rather than only focusing on the larger, more daunting goal. Finally, we should ensure that our goals are realistically achievable and take into account the limitations of our body and circumstances to avoid setting ourselves up for failure.

01:15:00
In this section of the video, Emily Balcetis discusses the importance of setting reasonable goals and planning ahead for obstacles or setbacks. She recommends being specific and realistic about what can be achieved each week and how to stay accountable, including utilizing social support. Balcetis also suggests shifting the focus from outcome-based goals (e.g. losing 20 pounds) to process-based goals (e.g. eating healthy or going to the gym today). Additionally, she encourages viewing obstacles and setbacks as learning opportunities rather than failures, which can facilitate creative self-exploration and growth.

01:20:00
In this section, Emily Balcetis discusses how she copes with stress and competing priorities. She emphasizes the need for patience and compartmentalization and reminds herself to stay present and enjoy each moment. She also reflects on how she used to spend time trying to get everyone to like her and now sees that as unhelpful. Finally, when asked about what success means to her, Balcetis says it is being happy, appreciating what she has, and avoiding social comparisons.
