Dr. Peter Attia discusses the benefits of longevity drugs, Alzheimer's Disease, and the three most important levers to pull in order to improve health and extend lifespan. He explains that while efficiency within aerobic activity is about using glucose or fat as energy sources, anaerobic activity is about using energy without oxygen. He goes on to say that when your body isn't demanding much energy, you can make ATP using glucose or fatty acids. Finally, he mentions that one place where people can find all of this information in one place is his website, PeterAttiaMD.com.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Dr. Peter Attia discusses a liquid biopsy technique that can help diagnose cancer early. He believes that this technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we treat cancer, and he is excited about the potential it has to improve the lifespan of people who are diagnosed with cancer.

00:05:00
Cell-free DNA sequencing is a promising technology for studying cancer, as it can identify tumors with high specificity. However, the FTC has filed an anti-trust lawsuit against Illumina, claiming that they will be able to monopolize the market. If the acquisition is not approved, it could delay cancer diagnosis and treatment by years.

00:10:00
The guest on this episode of the podcast is Dr. Peter Attia, who explains how the development of cancer-fighting drugs like Grail led to a new understanding of methylation patterns. He says that one of the biggest challenges in extending longevity is preventing cancer in the first place, and that screening and treating cancer when it is caught early is the key to success.

00:15:00
Dr. Peter Attia discusses longevity drugs, Alzheimer's disease, and the three most important levers to pull in order to improve health and longevity. He emphasizes the importance of exercise for optimal health, and discusses how poor posture can lead to poor breathing and increased risk for injury.

00:20:00
In this video, Dr. Peter Attia discusses the importance of longevity drugs, Alzheimer's disease, and the three most important levers to pull in order to improve longevity and live a healthier life. He emphasizes the importance of maintaining good hamstring control and back strength, and explains that sitting is one of the main contributors to a flared ribcage and anterior pelvic tilt.

00:25:00
In this video, Dr. Peter Attia discusses the importance of zone two training, which is a type of training that helps athletes reach their highest level of performance while avoiding the accumulation of lactate. Zone two training is considered to be below lactate threshold, which is the highest level at which an athlete can produce energy without experiencing pain.

00:30:00
Dr. Peter Attia discusses the benefits of fasting, strength training, and intermittent ketosis for longevity and weight loss. He emphasizes the importance of maintaining muscle mass during a fast, and the downside of time restricted feeding.

00:35:00
In this video, Dr. Peter Attia discusses the benefits and drawbacks of time-restricted eating, including front loading meals to help increase the chances of reaching a healthy weight and reducing social difficulties. He also recommends using technologies like Dexa to help individuals to better understand their own body's response to time-restricted eating.

00:40:00
Dr. Peter Attia discusses the potential benefits of longevity drugs and how caloric restriction, dietary restriction, and time restriction can all play a role in extending lifespan. He also discusses the use of branched-chain amino acids to mitigate muscle loss and notes that not many people are in the all-calorie restriction camp.

00:45:00
The study examined the effects of Lexapro and Psilocybin on depression, and found that the Psilocybin was more effective than the Lexapro.

00:50:00
In this study, psilocybin was not superior to Lexapro in terms of reducing depressive symptoms.

00:55:00
The video presents Dr. Peter Attia's thoughts on longevity drugs, Alzheimer's disease, and the importance of accurately guessing the magnitude of difference between treatments. Dr. Attia recommends that people learn how to read science and appreciate that it is not innate, and that science requires effort and practice. The topics covered in the video include the latest on semi-glutide and testosterone replacement therapy for men with type 2 diabetes.

01:00:00
The video discusses a study that failed to show a difference between two antidepressants, Lexapro and Psilocybin, in terms of efficacy. The study was not powered correctly, as it required a difference of four points or greater in order to be statistically significant. This high bar may have hindered the study's chance of success. Additionally, the video points out that some questions on a scale measuring self-esteem are not the same as questions measuring suicidal ideation or sleeping habits.

01:05:00
The study found that people who took a drug called SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) had a better response to the treatment, but the drug has more side effects than other treatments.

01:10:00
The video discusses Dr. Peter Attia's work on longevity drugs, Alzheimer's Disease, and the three most important levers to pull in order to improve these conditions. Dr. Attia notes that cholesterol is not water soluble, and that a system must be in place to move it around. He also discusses the apo b family and apo a family, and explains that most people are referring to apo b 100 when discussing apob. Dr. Attia notes that there is a sub-class of the apo b family called apo a kyla micron.

01:15:00
The video discusses how apob levels are a better biomarker for predicting cardiovascular risk than LDL levels. Dr. Peter Attia explains that ldl levels are not the only thing that cause atherosclerosis, and that ldls are only a problem if you have insulin resistance or a genetic condition that predisposes you to have too many ldls. He goes on to say that apob is a far superior measurement to ldc, and that the upshot is that there is no downside to having lower apob levels.

01:20:00
In this video, Dr. Peter Attia discusses the benefits of lowering apob levels, which can reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease. He also discusses the methods used to reduce apob levels, including cholesterol-lowering drug statins.

01:25:00
Dr. Peter Attia discusses the three most important levers to pull in order to improve longevity and reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Statins, a microvascular health statin, and rivomycin, a drug that inhibits fungal growth, are all potential levers to pull.

01:30:00
Rapamycin, a compound isolated from soil on Rapa Nui, is a powerful anti-fungal agent with remarkable anti-proliferative properties. It was initially developed as a treatment for organ transplant rejection, but has since been found to have many other benefits, including preventing the growth of tumors.

01:35:00
In this video, Dr. Peter Attia discusses how longevity drugs can be effective in extending lifespan in mice, and how this research is being replicated in other species. He also mentions that there is a lack of a meaningful biomarker of aging, and that this is one of the biggest problems in aging research today.

01:40:00
In this video, Dr. Peter Attia discusses how rapamycin can be helpful for reversing or treating diseases such as Alzheimer's and hearing loss. He also mentions that it is too soon to say for certain if rapamycin is effective for restoring hearing in humans.

01:45:00
The video discusses the potential benefits of three longevity drugs: carbos, canagaflozen, and metformin. Dr. Peter Attia discusses the side effects of each drug and why he prefers metformin. Kanaga flows is a class of drug known as an sglt2i inhibitor and it works in the kidney to prevent the reabsorption of glucose. It was developed to treat people with type 2 diabetes, and it has shown remarkable efficacy in doing so.

01:50:00
In this YouTube video, Dr. Peter Attia discusses some of the benefits of longevity drugs and the three most important levers to pull in order to create these benefits. He also discusses the potential side effects of these drugs and how to maximize their benefits.

01:55:00
Dr. Peter Attia discusses longevity drugs, Alzheimer's disease, and the three most important levers to pull in order to live longer. He believes that the nubbin, or the third leading cause of death worldwide, is a lethal part of fruit that should be avoided. His wife peels the nubbin from the fruit, and he takes care to never put it in the food. Sauna bathing is one of the strategies he is more bullish on than ever before, as it may help with sleep and other health benefits.

02:00:00
Peter Attia discusses the potential benefits of longevity drugs, Alzheimer's disease, and the three most important levers to pull in order to improve longevity. He also recommends using a stationary bike for zone two training.

02:05:00
The video discusses a study of a drug that lowers glucose but raises insulin, which may help to weight loss. The video also discusses the potential benefits of the drug, including improved insulin sensitivity and glucose levels.

02:10:00
Dr. Peter Attia discusses the benefits of longevity drugs, Alzheimer's disease, and the three most important levers to pull in order to improve health. He recommends that people learn more about scientific literacy and the importance of separating fact from fiction, and recommends the newsletter "Metabolomics and Energetics" as a resource. He also recommends the book "Bad Science" by Ben Goldacre.

02:15:00
In this video, Dr. Peter Attia discusses longevity drugs, Alzheimer's Disease, and the three most important levers to pull in order to improve health and extend lifespan. He explains that while efficiency within aerobic activity is about using glucose or fat as energy sources, anaerobic activity is about using energy without oxygen.

The study found that the fittest people in the study were generating 1.7 to 1.8 watts per kilo of body weight, while the type 2 diabetes patients were reaching 320 to 360 watts. Interestingly, the study found that the lactate curves of the fittest and type 2 diabetes patients were strikingly similar.

02:25:00
In this video, Dr. Peter Attia discusses the importance of zone two training and how it can be used to help improve various aspects of longevity, such as reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease and increasing the ability of the mitochondria to use oxygen. He also discusses the importance of tracking one's heart rate in order to determine if one is in zone two.

02:30:00
In this video, Dr. Peter Attia discusses the importance of longevity drugs, Alzheimer's disease, and the three most important levers to pull in order to improve lifespan and reduce Alzheimer's risk. He suggests starting out with heart rate testing to determine one's maximum heart rate, and then gradually increasing the intensity of training to reach a "sweet spot" where one can carry out a conversation, albeit with difficulty. He says it typically takes three to six months for adaptations to start happening, and that over the past two and a half years his Zone 2 power has increased by 25 watts.
