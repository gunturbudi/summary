In this section, Tim Ferriss discusses his note-taking process, which involves multiple passes and filtering the best notes to the top of your attention. He shows an example of a small notebook and an exercise he likes to do when he needs a reset, which is to write a list of the craziest things he could do to alleviate stress. He emphasizes that the ideas should be absurd, and out of those ideas, one may productively stretch the mind enough to find a solution that wouldn't have been considered otherwise.

This process is not for structured thinking, but rather for unstructured brain dumping. Lastly, Ferriss talks about the five-minute journal, which follows a simple and straightforward format including prompts like listing gratitudes and affirmations. Despite seeming hokey, these practices have proven to be helpful in reducing anxiety and improving focus.
