In this section, Tim Ferriss introduces Adam Robinson, his guest for this episode. Robinson is a skilled Chessmaster who has also made a lifelong study of outsmarting and outflanking the competition. He was mentored by Bobby Fischer and co-founded the Princeton Review, creating a revolutionary approach to taking standardized tests. He has also worked in the field of artificial intelligence and as a global macro advisor to successful hedge funds and family offices. Robinson shares four quotes that he lives his life by, including two from Rudyard Kipling and Amelia Earhart.

In this section, Adam Robinson explains that his favorite personal quote is "if you're not getting the results you want, change what you're doing." He suggests taking a step in the opposite direction, as Michael Jordan once recommended, to redirect your attention to the task at hand or to others, rather than yourself. Robinson believes that in his field of global finance, the common recommendation that more information leads to better investments is incorrect. To support this, he cites a study conducted by Paul Slovic in 1974 which found that as professional horse handicappers were given more pieces of information about the horses, their accuracy did not improve and remained at 17%.

In this section, Adam Robinson discusses how additional information can lead to overconfidence and confirmation bias in making investment decisions. Beyond a certain amount of information, additional data only feeds confirmation bias, leaving aside the considerable cost and delay occasioned in acquiring that information. He warns that the world is just far too complex to grasp and attempts to understand it more rigorously can lead to attachment to beliefs and a false sense of confidence, often blinding investors to unfolding financial trends right in front of their eyes. He advises investors to be aware of their models of the world and not to conclude that something makes no sense, but rather to acknowledge their mistaken models of the world, and to understand that the world always makes sense even if we don't. Adam Robinson's best investment advice is not financial, but rather his learning to meditate, which helped him turn off his relentlessly analyzing mind.

In this section, Adam Robinson talks about how he initially reframed meditation as a waste of time until he saw it as a way to quiet his conscious mind and allow his unconscious mind to take over and improve his analysis of the world. He then opted for biofeedback HRV training, which enabled him to achieve a zen-like calm on demand. The increased productivity and creativity from these restorative sessions became more valuable to him than the unproductive time he spent meditating. Adam also talks about recognizing the importance of others in not only changing the world but also in enjoying it, which has become a habit that has most improved his life in recent years. Enrolling others in his plans and vision has helped him to create new success that he had never expected before.

In this section, Adam Robinson provides advice to a college student entering the real world. He notes that leaving school marks the first time when you make all decisions affecting your life without clear instructions, and you’ll have to find your incentives, especially in a world where the traits and habits that served you well in school may work against you. Furthermore, you’ll interact with different people, and you’ll have to develop a whole new set of people skills and ways of relating to them, as your life rhythms shift from the academic calendar to establishing your routines. He advises against asking yourself what you want to do but rather who you want to be and finding enthusiasm in everything. Finally, he points out that success might not come to you instantly and recommends paying your dues while waiting for the opportunity that will launch your life forward.

In this section, Adam Robinson emphasizes the importance of creating compelling visions of the future to attract success and happiness both professionally and personally. He emphasizes that by connecting to a personal mission, an individual can uncover their true purpose, allowing for personal and professional goals to be achieved more rapidly. Robinson suggests finding what one loves and cultivating those talents, then relentlessly searching for jobs or situations that highlight those passions. Additionally, he notes that success is achieved when one is not seeking it directly, but rather by focusing on being their best self in the world and letting the rewards come naturally. When feeling unfocused or overwhelmed, Robinson recommends rehearsing one's best self and focusing on achieving their mission, while also promoting the importance of saying no to commitments to avoid becoming overcommitted and frazzled.

In this section, Adam Robinson shares his approach for deciding whether to say yes or no to any request, proposal or invitation, as well as his editing principle. He advises having a personal mission in life to help filter decisions, and prioritizing time spent on pursuits related to this mission. He believes that when you align your goals and direction with your mission, all aspects of your life will fall into place. Adam also shares his love of spreading kindness to strangers through random acts of generosity, and the positive effects it can have on their community.
