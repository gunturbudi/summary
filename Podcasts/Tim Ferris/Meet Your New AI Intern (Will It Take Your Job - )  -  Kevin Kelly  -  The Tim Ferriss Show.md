In this video, Kevin Kelly explains that while AI may take over certain tasks within certain jobs, it has yet to replace entire jobs. Kelly believes that AI will become like "universal personal interns" performing tasks that need to be curated and directed by human managers, rather than replacing them. He further discusses the impact of AI on the creative economy and art industries. Kelly argues that there will likely be people and companies who make training sets that are ethical and fair trade. Additionally, he addresses the issue of copying art styles, stating that if people are relevant, they're going to be copied anyway.

In this section of the video, Kevin Kelly argues that while AI may replace certain tasks in a job, it has yet to replace any entire jobs. He notes that many jobs consist of complex tasks, some of which AI is not yet capable of doing. Furthermore, he points out that there are millions of new images being generated daily by AI, but most of them serve only for the enjoyment of the viewer and not to replace any specific job. Kelly believes that AI will become like "universal personal interns," performing tasks that need to be curated and directed by human managers, in the case of logo design, for example.

In this section, Kevin Kelly and Tim Ferriss discuss the potential impact of AI on the creative economy and art industries. Kelly argues that there will likely be people and companies who make training sets that are ethical and fair trade. People will eventually start to clamor to be included in the training set, which would require far fewer examples than currently needed, potentially requiring some top-down governance to assist in the development. Kelly also addresses the issue of copying art styles, saying that if people are relevant, they're going to be copied anyway.
