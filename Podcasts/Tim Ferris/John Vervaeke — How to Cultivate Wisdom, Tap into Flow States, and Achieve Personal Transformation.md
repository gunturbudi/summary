Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
John Vervaeke discusses the four ways of knowing, which are propositional, procedural, perspectival, and semantic. He goes on to say that these different forms of knowledge are distinct, and that the standard of realness for each is different. He also mentions that skills are not true or false, but are instead based on knowledge and real-world application.

00:05:00
John Vervaeke discusses the various types of knowing, including participatory and procedural, and their importance in achieving personal transformation. He provides an example of how perspectival knowing allows for the activation of an affordance, which is necessary for successful culture shock.

00:10:00
John Vervaeke discusses how the flow state is an optimal state for people, how it permeates all aspects of a person's life, and how getting into the flow state is a result of practicing certain disciplines. He also discusses how the flow state is important for productivity and wellbeing.

00:15:00
John Vervaeke discusses how skill and context can affect flow states, and how a framework around the skill can help to generate resonance. He provides an example of world champion Tai Chi player Joshua Waitzkin, who is able to take concepts from different disciplines and apply them to other areas of his life.

00:20:00
John Vervaeke describes how he has learned to get into the flow state when lecturing, which affords good learning. He says that it is a cultivated skill, developed from early on by adopting the role of teacher and practicing Tai Chi Chuan. He believes that the flow state enhances insight capacities and intuition. He warns that PowerPoint can kill the flow state, because the presenter wants to be clear and have everything follow a script.

00:25:00
John Vervaeke talks about how growing up in a fundamentalist Christian family left him with a hunger for wisdom, which he found in philosophy and later in Tai Chi and Meditation. He eventually found an ecology of practices that satisfied that hunger, including Vipassana, metta, and Tai Chi.

00:30:00
John Vervaeke discusses how his experiences of trauma and depression led him to pursue knowledge and wisdom. He defines wisdom as knowledge and understanding overcome ignorance, and foolishness as a mood or state of mind that prevents one from achieving their goals. He provides examples of how this can happen in life, and encourages listeners to seek out wisdom in order to achieve personal transcendence.

00:35:00
John Vervaeke discusses the paradox of intelligence and self-deception, which is that the processes that make us good problem solvers can also lead to self-deception. He provides an example of how a chess player can control the center board by focusing on one part of the board, but this heuristic is only a biased approximation of the full game and cannot solve all problems. Vervaeke argues that all heuristics are biased and interchangeable, and that analytical thinking is dependent on practice and a "aha" moment.

00:40:00
John Vervaeke discusses how logic is not always suited to solving problems, and how intuition is a better way to solve them. He explains that relevance is not a logical property, and that using logic to try and capture it is doomed to fail. He recommends using psychological similarity to figure out what is relevant and important.

00:45:00
John Vervaeke discusses the work of Arthur Reber and Hogarth on implicit learning, which he defines as the ability to pick up on complex patterns without explicit awareness or deliberate effort. He goes on to say that while implicit learning is powerful, it has a danger in that it can mistakenly assume causal relationships where there are only correlational relationships. Hogarth proposes that we can overcome this danger by setting up clear feedback and information regimes in order to allow implicit learning to work properly.

00:50:00
John Vervaeke discusses how intuition can be harmful, and how one can cultivate wisdom by using clear and tightly coupled feedback, error having to matter, and pursuing an ecology of practices. He provides an example of how he has applied this knowledge in his own life, and recommends practicing an ecology of practices in order to improve one's ability to spot spurious or at the very least unhelpful patterns.

00:55:00
John Vervaeke discusses how to cultivate wisdom, flow states, and personal transformation by practicing active open-mindedness, metacognitive shifting, and dialectic. He provides example exercises that can be done to practice these skills.

01:00:00
John Vervaeke discusses how to frame situations and achieve personal transformation. He teaches people how to center and follow their breath, but warns against attaching positive emotions to the process. Metta is a technique of opening oneself up to see if one can see the other person better than before, and to explore the possibility of transformation for both parties.

01:05:00
John Vervaeke discusses how to cultivate wisdom, flow states, and personal transformation by using meditation, contemplation, and circling. He suggests that one half of communication is listening, which can be difficult to do. He recommends slowing down to operate within that constraint, and then moving on to philosophical fellowship.

01:10:00
John Vervaeke discusses how to cultivate wisdom by invoking a sage, and how this can help you achieve personal transformation. He provides a phrase from Spinoza that relates God to the world in the same way that the mind is related to the body. He shares an example from Orthodox Christianity of how this idea is explored.

01:15:00
John Vervaeke discusses the idea that there are shared presuppositions between modern theism and ancient theism, and how these presuppositions influence how people think about and relate to God. He goes on to discuss how non-theists can develop a relationship with the no-thingness that is ultimate reality, and how this can lead to a deep sense of sacredness. Tai Chi is cited as an example of a practice that can help cultivate this sense of sacredness.

01:20:00
John Vervaeke discusses the concept of "eternity," which is different from the physical concept of time. He talks about how one must make the move out of the cave and into the world of eternity in order to cultivate wisdom. He encourages people to explore the whole continuum of experiences, situate them within an ecology of practices, and learn from religious traditions. He believes that dismissing religious traditions is a mistake, and that dialogue and learning are essential to solving the meaning crisis and nihilism.

01:25:00
John Vervaeke discusses how Sufism has had a profound impact on his life, and how it can be used to connect with other worldviews and achieve personal transformation. He also discusses the importance of being careful when engaging in cultural appropriation, and how Neoplatonism has the potential to be a powerful way of life for the cultivation of wisdom.

01:30:00
John Vervaeke discusses his experience of encountering Socrates and Pierre Hadot's book What Is Ancient Philosophy?, which provides a philosophical way of life. He discusses how these two experiences opened up new possibilities for him in terms of his journey of personal growth and meaning-making.

01:35:00
John Vervaeke discusses the importance of Plato's Dialogues and Plotinus' Ennead in his journey to cultivate wisdom and tap into flow states. He believes that both books are sacred to him and have transformed him into the person he is today. He recommends these books to others, claiming that they are simultaneously profound philosophical arguments and spiritually transformative exercises. Rilke and Blake are his second and third choices for books that would nourish one's soul.

01:40:00
John Vervaeke discusses the four Es of cognition: Embodied, Coupled to the environment, Acted, and Extended. He states that cognition is something that you are doing, not something you have, and it's between you and the world, not within you. He encourages people to find and understand this information so they can take care of themselves and their own cognitive capacities.

01:45:00
John Vervaeke discusses the six Es of consciousness: emotional, cognitive, experiential, functional, and spiritual. He argues that emotions are not irrational, and that the brain is constantly repurposing things for new purposes. He also discusses qualia, the question of what consciousness is for, and the hard problem of qualia.

01:50:00
John Vervaeke discusses how consciousness functions and how it overlaps with other cognitive abilities. He argues that consciousness is for enhanced relevance realization and that it exists in animals other than humans.

01:55:00
John Vervaeke discusses the three heresies of his: consensus, qualia, and panpsychism. He argues that consensus is irrelevant, qualia can be explained by relevance realization, and panpsychism is nonsense. He provides evidence for the quantum effects in smell and attention, but not for the consciousness of intelligent beings.

02:00:00
John Vervaeke discusses panpsychism, which is the theory that consciousness is a fundamental, ontological building block of reality. He argues that the evidence against panpsychism is significantly greater than the evidence for it, and he does not believe that there is any consciousness like his trapped in tables.

02:05:00
John Vervaeke discusses the importance of narratives and how they are essential for meaning-making. He shares that Jordan Peterson and he share similar views on the importance of narratives, but Peterson places more emphasis on the pre-narrative dialogue component.

02:10:00
John Vervaeke and Jordan B. Peterson have a deep philosophical disagreement about the role of narratives in cognition. Peterson believes that narratives are developmentally indispensable, while Vervaeke believes that they are not metaphysically necessary. Peterson also places more emphasis on practices and theorizing, while Vervaeke places more emphasis on connecting to reality non-narratively.

02:15:00
John Vervaeke discusses how the meaning crisis can be addressed by adapting our thinking to include non-propositional aspects of life. He argues that this requires a change in perspective, one that involves confronting arguments on an intellectual level instead of demonizing opponents. He provides an example of how this can be done by engaging in opponent processing with those we disagree with.

02:20:00
John Vervaeke's After Socrates course is designed to help people better understand and engage with the spiritual aspects of their lives. The course takes a detailed look at the spiritual teachings of Socrates, and provides guidance on how to practice these teachings more effectively. The course is designed for both individuals and groups, and is meant to help people cultivate wisdom, tap into flow states, and achieve personal transformation.

02:25:00
John Vervaeke discusses the terms "subjective" and "objective" and how they've been taken to be an exhaustive division of reality, with the Western world adopting this framework in the past 200 years. He goes on to talk about how this framework is problematic, as it's incomplete and radically incommensurable with other ways of looking at the world.

02:30:00
John Vervaeke discusses how the way one relates to their experienced reality has changed as they have studied cognitive science and philosophy. He discusses how this has led to a more profound and transformative experience of love.

02:35:00
John Vervaeke discusses how the idea of a connected, participatory reality is both old and new, and shares how 4E cognitive science is advancing this concept. He points out that three of the four ways of knowing are about this type of reality, and that it is important to think of the mind not as being in the head, but between the body and the world. This is an old concept that has been explored in the Neoplatonic tradition.
