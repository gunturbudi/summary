02:40:00
Balaji Srinivasan discusses the network state and how to start a new country. He argues that you need to carefully engineer a network in order to have a positive global sum, something like Twitter has a global leaderboard which is inherently zero-sum. If you're rising the leaderboard, someone else is falling or vice versa, resulting in coalitional zero-sum behavior. This means that you have a network defect, as people polarize around certain moral beliefs and the network becomes less valuable as it increases in scale. Just like a company, you're just hiring more people isn't necessarily the optimum strategy, and you need to grow to the limit of what makes sense for your community to work. Laws are going to be different all over the world and people will lose their minds in different ways, but starting a new country has more legitimacy than just like a company doing it. It's like a hybrid where it is really a group of people, with hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of highly motivated zealots and activists who believe in this.
