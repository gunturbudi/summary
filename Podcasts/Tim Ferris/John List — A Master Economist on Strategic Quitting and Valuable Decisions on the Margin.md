Detail Summary:

John List discusses the use of clawback incentives, which are schemes that reverse the way traditional incentives work. He shares examples of how these incentives have been used in his personal life, in his work as an economist at Lyft, and with teachers in his own children's pre-k school. The results of these incentive schemes are often positive, with workers often performing better and students learning more.

00:05:00
John List discusses the importance of using input incentives, such as giving rewards like baseball cards, to increase the output of a worker. He also discusses the dangers of using loss aversion as an incentive, such as giving workers a bonus only after they reach a certain goal, as this can lead to resentment or learned helplessness.

00:10:00
The video discusses the effectiveness of strategic quitting, or making decisions on the margin, and the potential side effects of such actions. It also discusses the use of behavioral nudges, such as a clawback, and how they can be effective in changing behavior. Finally, the video discusses the durability of incentives and how they can impact the success of a strategy.

00:15:00
John List discusses how his research on strategic quitting and valuable decisions on the margin has helped him in his work as a fundraiser. He talks about how he learned from fundraising experts that having upfront money is key to successful fundraising. List also discusses his work as an assistant professor at the University of Central Florida and how he started a center for environmental policy analysis with the help of the dean. List describes how his work has helped him learn about how people give and how to get something done correctly the next time.

00:20:00
John List discusses the importance of strategic quitting, research on generosity, and the effects of tipping on tipping behavior. He discusses how the findings of his research have impacted his work with charities and Uber.

00:25:00
John List discusses the "average trip" and the percentage of tipping conducted in the United States. He also discusses the impact of different UIs and flows on tipping behavior. Finally, he shares an anecdote about his experience working with Jeff Bezos and how he helped introduce an employee at Amazon.

00:30:00
John List discusses strategies for quitting a job, and how to make sure the exit is beneficial for both the individual and the company. He also discusses research he has done at Uber on apologies, and how they optimize the compensation for drivers based on their past tipping behavior.

00:35:00
John List discusses the concept of strategic quitting, or making decisions on the margin that have big impacts but that often go unnoticed. He relates this to the story of his experience with Uber, in which he was scheduled to give a keynote talk alongside the Nobel Prize-winning development economist Angus Deaton. When he arrived at the conference, he realized that he had forgotten his slides and Uber had taken him to the wrong location. Although the situation turned out okay, List says that the Uber experience was the worst part of his day. He never received an apology from the company, and he eventually stopped using Uber.

00:40:00
John List's paper, "Few Nice People Are Out There," discusses the theory that there are few nice people in the world, and that this leads to a lot of hurt and damage. List provides examples of how this theory has been proven in real life, such as in the case of ride-sharing companies.

00:45:00
John List explores how market behavior shapes social preferences and how this can result in unfair comparisons. He provides an example of how this can happen with ride sharing, which is often compared to taxi rides without any data to support the claims.

00:50:00
John List explains how critical thinking skills help us make better decisions, even in the face of difficult circumstances. He discusses the theory of mind, which is the ability to put oneself in another person's shoes and understand their motives. List discusses the importance of critical thinking in both the abstract and data-gathering stages of decision-making, and provides examples of how it can be used in everyday life.

00:55:00
John List discusses the theory of mind primitives of decision making, which include understanding what preferences and beliefs of others exist, and constraints on those preferences and beliefs. He discusses how to develop this skill, suggesting starting with understanding what an economist calls "the primitives." He also discusses how to improve decision making skills in poker by using an exogenous force, such as a clock, to help randomize the decisions a player makes.

01:00:00
John List's new book, "The Voltage Effect: How to Make Good Ideas Great and Great Ideas Scale" is a guide to making great ideas scale. List shares his experiences running a preschool, and how scaling the program proved difficult. He talks to policymakers, and they tell him that the program is a great example of how to make great ideas great. However, when he tries to scale it, he runs into difficulties.

01:05:00
John List explains how field studies can help circumvent the "replicability crisis" in science, as they often have more data and incentives aligned than lab experiments.

01:10:00
John List discusses the concept of "annakarenina," or the "voltage effect," which refers to the fact that policies or ideas that work in a lab or small setting may not work in a larger, more complex world. He goes on to say that truly scalable ideas need to have one or more of the five "vital signs" in order to be successful, and that scaling is a "weak link" problem that can often hinder an idea's chances of success. List provides an example of how Anna Karenina could be considered a scalable idea because it has the silver bullet characteristic of being able to be successfully replicated. He then discusses the five vital signs of a scalable idea and provides examples of ideas that do or do not have them.

01:15:00
John List discusses the five "vital signs" of an idea before delving into an example of Jonas Sulk, a scientist who successfully developed a polio vaccine. List notes that an idea must have voltage (it must be true for all kids), be true to oneself (measuring how big of a market can it be), have skin in the game (having a lot of skin in the game ensures that the idea will be pursued), understand spillovers (what happens if the idea is successful), and understand the supply side (knowing how much it will cost to provide the idea). List argues that if an idea has any of these five signs, it is a good idea to pursue.

01:20:00
John List discusses the importance of strategic quitting and valuable decisions on the margin. List discusses how an unintended consequence can cause the good effects of an incentive to go away, and how network externalities can increase the value of an idea.

01:25:00
John List discusses the importance of strategic quitting and valuable decisions on the margin. He explains that, due to the high rejection rates for Uber and Lyft drivers, drivers can earn more by accepting shorter trips. List also discusses how to incentivize drivers with bonuses and fines.

01:30:00
John List, a 20-year veteran of the academic field of strategic quitting, shares his experience of receiving cold receptions from potential employers based on his prior work in field experiments. He says that this type of reception is common for those conducting field experiments, a field in which taking risks is often necessary for success. List advises those considering a career in academia to apply to as many universities as possible and to be themselves, rather than conform to the expectations of others.

01:35:00
John List discusses the importance of fractals in economics, discusses how fractals can help in predicting human behavior, and provides advice for managers and decision-makers.

01:40:00

01:45:00
John List talks about how he learned to think critically and make decisions based on the best evidence, and how this is important in business. He shares a personal story of how he realized that his dream of becoming an economist was over, and how this lesson helped him make better decisions in his golf career.

01:50:00
John List discusses the importance of strategic quitting and recommends periodically checking one's options and assessing if the option is a good fit for one's comparative advantage. He provides an example of a basketball player who does not want to quit because he is competing against Michael Jordan.

01:55:00
John List provides a compelling argument for strategic quitting, or moving on to a new job if one is not happy at their current one.

He suggests that quitting is a difficult decision, but if a company values community spirit, it should be a top priority.
