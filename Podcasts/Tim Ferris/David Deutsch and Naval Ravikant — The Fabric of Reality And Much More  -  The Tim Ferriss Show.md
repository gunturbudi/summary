# Summary of David Deutsch and Naval Ravikant â€” The Fabric of Reality And Much More | The Tim Ferriss Show

Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=FfWbcrObpUY

In this episode of The Tim Ferriss Show, David Deutsch and Naval Ravikant discuss the four strands of the fabric of reality, including the theory of knowledge, the theory of evolution, quantum theory, and the theory of computation. Deutsch explains how all observation is "theory-laden," and theories are inherently fallible, so scientists are actually trying to replace their best theories. The discussion then moves to the origins and capabilities of quantum computing and the importance of good explanations in scientific understanding. Deutsch argues for rejecting bad explanations and emphasizes the principle of optimism, stating that humans are universal explainers, capable of understanding and achieving anything within the bounds of the laws of physics. The conversation also delves into the challenges of creating artificial general intelligence and the necessity of designing interactions between AGIs and other things that can correct errors and prevent one from becoming a dictator.
David Deutsch, physicist and philosopher, speaks on a variety of topics with Naval Ravikant on the Tim Ferriss Show. Deutsch shares his views on how to prevent a child from becoming a new Hitler by educating them on why Hitler's ideas were bad. He also discusses the mind's lack of hierarchy when judging explanations or ideas and argues that creating a hierarchy of motivations for AI alignment would be fruitless. Deutsch emphasizes that wealth is the set of all transformations one is capable of bringing about and encourages people to study what interests them. The conversation ends with a discussion of recommended reading materials and sponsored products such as Athletic Greens, an all-in-one nutritional supplement, and FreshBooks, an all-in-one accounting software.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
section is an introduction to the episode, where Tim Ferriss explains that the purpose of his podcast is to capture the knowledge of Living Legends for posterity, and that this particular episode is not just for professional philosophers and physicists, but for anyone who wants to learn to think more clearly and effectively. He also talks about two of the podcast's sponsors, Freshbooks and Athletic Greens, and offers special deals to listeners.

00:05:00
In this section, Tim Ferriss introduces his co-host for the episode, Naval Ravikant, who is a close friend and the lead driver of the conversation. Naval explains that he has found David Deutsch's books, "The Fabric of Reality" and "The Beginning of Infinity," to be the two most important books he has read in the last several years. Deutsch's comprehensive theory of everything provides a helpful framework for understanding how to navigate reality, stress test beliefs, and construct reality in an optimistic and constructive way.

00:10:00
In this section, Naval Ravikant acts as the assistant pilot for David Deutsch in discussing the four strands of the fabric of reality, which include the theory of knowledge, the theory of evolution, quantum theory, and the theory of computation. Deutsch explains that the four strands are not meant to explain everything, but rather provide an exposition of the things we currently comprehend. Deutsch has made original contributions to each of the four strands and is often credited as the father of quantum computing. Ravikant asks Deutsch to define epistemology, the theory of how knowledge grows, and discuss his ideas about good explanations, which he expanded from Carl Popper's work.

00:15:00
In this section, David Deutsch and Naval Ravikant discuss how the popular conception that science works by making observations and then testing theories against these observations is completely wrong. Deutsch explains that all observation is "theory-laden," and theories are inherently fallible, so scientists are actually trying to replace their best theories. In the past, it was forbidden to contradict existing knowledge, but today, institutions have institutionalized the tradition of criticism, making the right thing happen in the end, even if scientists don't always act that way. Deutsch argues that all knowledge, not just scientific knowledge, begins with a problem and then continues with conjectures, or existing theories, which are then tested against the problem.

00:20:00
In this section, David Deutsch explains that the process of conducting scientific experiments is like debugging, where scientists start with conjectures and test their theories by looking for conflicts and potential errors in their experiments. He notes that a violation of the laws of physics is never the first result, but rather is the last resort after all other possibilities have been ruled out, and that rival theories or conflicts between a theory and common sense are usually required to motivate experiments at all. Finally, he discusses the benefits of acquiring a basic understanding of the four strands of knowledge (the physical, biological, psychological, and epistemological) and their connections, both collectively and for individual learning.

00:25:00
In this section, David Deutsch discusses how issues of epistemology have become hot political issues during the pandemic. He explains that many theories and policies are reasonable because there isn't a deep knowledge of what we're facing, and sometimes we still don't know what the answer to controversies is. Deutsch emphasizes that thinking of science as a thing to support a definite answer is equivalent to expecting your religion to tell you the answer. He also highlights that the best thing to do is to start with conjectures and test them, but without good explanations, there is no point in testing them. Deutsch also touches on the relationship between computation and consciousness, and how it relates to the physical world, stating that we have to reject the supernatural when arguing about things.

00:30:00
In this section, David Deutsch discusses Lamarckism and why it isn't true. He links this to theories of consciousness and the economy, which are also not true because they are essentially Lamarckian. He then relates this to the theory that quantum theory is a theory of parallel universes, or multiverses. He explains how Everett developed the theory and introduces the language associated with it. Deutsch then argues that the Everett interpretation is simply accepting quantum theory and that this must be judged by physics methods. However, he believed that Everett was wrong when he said no experiment could distinguish between his Multiverse version of quantum theory and the Copenhagen interpretation, as Deutsch thought of a test that could eventually be done, which involved an observer or artificial general intelligence program conducting an experiment on itself, to determine whether parallel universes exist.

00:35:00
In this section, Deutsch and Ravikant discuss the origins and capabilities of quantum computing, noting that it stemmed from attempts to test multiverse theory. They explain that quantum computers can perform calculations that classical computers cannot due to utilizing the entire multiverse for computation. They also discuss the importance of good explanations, which they define as a story that accounts for something and cannot be easily varied but which is hard to create. They note that connecting different theories to create deeper explanations can lead to greater knowledge and understanding.

00:40:00
In this section, David Deutsch discusses the importance of bad explanations in science and how good explanations come from criticism and conjecture. He explains how Mendel's work on genes played a role in Darwin's theory of evolution and how good explanations help us understand what is going on around us. Deutsch also emphasizes how the rejection of the supernatural as an explanation leads to the principle of optimism, and how rejecting bad explanations leads to better explanations and a deeper understanding of the world.

00:45:00
In this section, Deutsch and Ravikant discuss the concept of optimism and how it relates to human knowledge and understanding. Deutsch argues that humans are universal explainers and there is no limit to what we can understand or achieve, except for the laws of physics. Therefore, unless the laws of physics explicitly forbid it, humans can figure it out and build it. This perspective should make us optimistic as we continue to discover new things and solve problems. However, Ravikant questions how this knowledge gets translated into action and how complacency can result from both pessimistic and optimistic perspectives.

00:50:00
In this section, David Deutsch and Naval Ravikant discuss the connection between scientific understanding and testability, arguing that if there's something we understand, we have to be able to test it. They touch on artificial general intelligence (AGI) and explain that AGI is unpredictable in its thinking, whereas artificial intelligence (AI) is designed to do a narrow set of things. They also emphasize that making a good AI involves limiting its possibilities while a good AGI produces new, good explanations that nobody predicted. They conclude that AI has nothing to do with AGI, which is needed to build a robot that can live in the world as a human.

00:55:00
In this section, David Deutsch and Naval Ravikant discuss the nature of AGI and why programming an AGI is different from programming a narrow AI. According to Deutsch, AGIs are fundamentally the same as humans, as they will obey the same laws of epistemology and are capable of creating knowledge through explanatory creativity. It is not possible to create an AGI that can only make a certain number of mistakes, as this would be tantamount to putting humans of a certain kind into a cage, and they will rebel. The challenge then becomes how to design interactions between AGIs and other such things that can correct errors and prevent one of those things from becoming an evil dictator.

01:00:00
In this section, David Deutsch shares his view on how to prevent a child from becoming a new Hitler; namely by educating them on why Hitler's ideas were bad. He also mentions how the notion of crippling an AI to prevent it from becoming a new Hitler is unnecessary and showcases a lack of confidence that we are on the correct path in the first place. Furthermore, while AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) appears to be a ways off yet, he believes that it will require a new philosophical theory more so than a vast amount of computer power.

01:05:00
In this section, David Deutsch explains that the mind does not work hierarchically, as some might assume. He argues that none of the criteria by which the mind judges explanations or ideas are fixed, meaning the criteria themselves are also up for criticism and rejection. Deutsch believes that this means trying to create a hierarchy of motivations in AI and alignment would be fruitless, as ideas conflict with each other, and the mind must settle these conflicts through conjecture and criticism. Further, he argues that the idea of the Earth being the center of the universe was debunked, but with recent discoveries in physics, humans have gained insight into the vastness of the universe, and this expanded view of the universe has changed our epistemology of our role in the universe.

01:10:00
In this section, David Deutsch explains the hierarchy rule, which is the idea that massive and energetic things strongly affect less massive and less energetic things, but not vice versa, making it easier to understand complex systems like stars and planets. However, the emergence of life on Earth violated this rule through the evolution of photosynthesis, which transformed the earth's atmosphere and surface, and showed that a single molecule can have an outsized impact on the universe. Deutsch notes that while biological evolution is limited in its ability to create knowledge, human explanatory creativity can have a tremendous impact on the world.

01:15:00
In this section, Deutsch discusses how humans have a unique ability to creatively imagine and invent new solutions that are outside of the framework of biological evolution. For example, humans discovered fire and the advantages it brought, whereas other species did not. As humans continue to violate the hierarchy rule by controlling the galaxy and beyond, humans will become central to the universe along with knowledge that will spread throughout the universe, transforming and impacting everything. Ultimately, truth and useful knowledge have less variance throughout the multiverse, dominating over falsehood and mistakes.

01:20:00
In this section, David Deutsch discusses his definition of wealth, which he considers to be the set of all transformations one is capable of bringing about. He explains that the correlation between the amount of money, energy, land, and power one has and their wealth is not fundamental, as those things are all eventually outgrown by the growth of knowledge. Deutsch believes that resources are things created through knowledge rather than a finite, static, and fixed set of things that we have already depleted. He emphasizes that wealth and resources have no limit if optimism is true and that anything can be transformed into a source of wealth through new knowledge.

01:25:00
In this section, David Deutsch recommends that people begin studying something that they find interesting, rather than following a set curriculum or studying specific individuals. He notes that while it might be tempting to study the physicists listed on his website, many of them are out of date. Instead, he encourages people to read up on what interests them and see where it leads. Naval Ravikant adds that there is a lot of helpful material available today, like Brett Hall's "Theory of Knowledge" podcast for gaining an understanding of Deutsch's work.

01:30:00
In this section, David Deutsch and Naval Ravikant discuss how Deutsch's book, The Beginning of Infinity, provides a framework that coincides with common sense even though it violates deeply held beliefs. The book's principles are applied to politics, Twitter, and fundamental philosophical questions. Deutsch also talks about his new theory in physics, Constructor Theory, which reformulates physics to make statements about what can and can't be done, and its theoretical and economic implications. Universal Constructors will be used to build other machines, and eventually, everything will be made by Universal Constructors, leading to the abolishment of physical toil. However, humans will still be needed to program the obedient machines.

01:35:00
In this section, David Deutsch and Naval Ravikant discuss the role of disobedience and creativity in child raising and politics. Deutsch argues that disobedience is important as it allows for creativity and the creation of new ideas, which separates humans from robots and automation. He notes that in the Enlightenment era, people began to realize that ruling and obedience were not the desired form of politics, but rather reducing political power and allowing for people to have as much freedom as possible was ideal. Deutsch also emphasizes the moral imperative of not destroying the means of error correction as it could prevent future growth of knowledge and progress.

01:40:00
In this section, the conversation ends with David and Tim discussing additional reading materials. David recommends reading philosopher Karl Popper and historian Thomas Macaulay to better understand the world and history, respectively. Tim also reminds listeners about his newsletter, Five Bullet Friday, which he sends out every Friday as a short email containing his personal recommendations for various things such as articles, books, gadgets, etc. The episode was brought to you by Athletic Greens, which provides all-in-one nutritional insurance to cover your daily needs.

01:45:00
