In this section, Tim Ferriss introduces his guest, Aryeh B. Bourkoff, the chairman and CEO of LionTree, an independent investment and merchant bank that advises and invests in CEOs and the companies they lead. Before founding LionTree, Bourkoff spent 13 years at UBS, closing his tenure as the vice-chairman and head of Americas Investment Banking. The conversation then transitions to Bourkoff's experience as a high-yield research analyst, where he served as the number one cable and satellite analyst by Institutional Investor for seven consecutive years. Bourkoff attributes his success as an analyst to his ability to understand a company's fundamental picture and its future trajectory, as well as the emotional stability necessary to make bold predictions that can be wrong.

In this section, Aryeh Bourkoff talks about the importance of admitting when you are wrong, even in minor things, as it builds credibility and self-confidence. He also explains that taking a public stance requires a published report with a thematic perspective and specific company recommendations, supported by analysis and thematics. The ultimate goal of this is to predict the future, and Bourkoff describes the process of defending arguments internally before releasing reports to the public. He emphasizes the importance of building credibility and a track record of being right in order to gain the trust of investors and make profitable recommendations.

00:10:00
In this section, Aryeh Bourkoff talks about how he got into the finance industry and how he convinced his parents, who are academics, to support his career choice. He believes that finance is the industry where people's dreams and visions take shape and it has a significant role in helping entrepreneurs make those dreams a reality. He worked hard to get into the heart of finance and to be better than the rest, eventually earning a shot from Alan Ginsberg, who was a creative person in finance and gave Bourkoff a chance to work for him. Bourkoff recalls how he felt overwhelmed watching Ginsberg's skill of analysis and communication but with time he learned to be competitive and master the field.

In this section, Aryeh Bourkoff discusses his early days in New York and how he worked hard to establish himself in the city. He narrates his job-hunting journey and how he landed an interview with a guy named Paul Ting at Oppenheimer. During the interview, Ting asked if he knew Visual Basic, which Bourkoff didn't. Bourkoff took this as an opportunity to learn and master the programming language. However, he never received a call back from Ting despite knowing the programming language. Several years later, he ran into Ting and welcomed him to UBS while letting him know that he had mastered the language. Bourkoff also shares his philosophy of being kind to people and not burning bridges as the "toe you step on today could be connected to the ass you're going to kiss tomorrow."

00:20:00
In this section, Aryeh Bourkoff talks about how he got his start in the media industry, including how Karine Krenik, an HR person, gave him his first chance and introduced him to Alan Ginsberg. Bourkoff explains how Ginsberg taught him the importance of being well-rounded and paying attention to different sectors, emphasizing that it's easy to get comfortable and live in a box, but it takes a strong core to step outside of that box and into the unknown. Bourkoff believes that having a clear set of values is essential to being able to do this and not simply conforming to the winds of the moment.

00:25:00
In this section, Aryeh Bourkoff talks about the importance of having a strong foundation of core values. He believes that everyone needs to hold on to foundational poles that make up their core to survive difficult situations. By having these poles to believe in, one is comfortable around different types of people and can build pattern recognition and perspective to understand where the world is going. Bourkoff adds that everyone has their own blocks, and the more exercise one undertakes to overcome their limitations, the better perspective they can get of different cultures. Finally, he implies that one must be comfortable going into a controversial scenario or live a non-controversial life by asking oneself challenging questions and seeking self-growth.

00:30:00
In this section, Aryeh Bourkoff discusses his approach to defining environments for himself instead of letting the environment define him. He talks about how he is comfortable everywhere but belongs nowhere, and how he applies this mindset to his career by constantly moving to new areas where he can apply his skills and learn new things. Bourkoff believes that being comfortable in the "gray area" between the known and unknown gives him a competitive advantage. Later in the video, he shares a story about how he solved the problem of not having enough time by blocking off Wednesdays from 6-10 p.m. for overflow meetings.

00:35:00
In this section, media executive Aryeh Bourkoff shares how he navigated a crowded schedule and made time for second-tier contacts by adding "office hours" from 10 PM to 2 AM on Wednesday nights in the first year of his company. Bourkoff's assistant initially told him he didn't have time for second-tier contacts, but he challenged her to be creative and figure out a way to say yes. Though this choice meant sacrificing sleep, the office hours proved immensely valuable in building relationships and gaining a better understanding of the company's purpose. Ultimately, Bourkoff believes companies should prioritize depth over volume in their relationships.

He highlights that the calendar must reflect the strategy of the firm and the changes in people, and this understanding needs to mimic one another.

00:45:00
In this section, Aryeh Bourkoff discusses the importance of setting a balance between offense and defense in one's calendar, and between internal and external meetings. He suggests that internal meetings are like costs or investments, while external meetings should be revenue or for future revenue, which means that companies should aim for a 70/30 or 80/20 ratio between external and internal meetings. Bourkoff also emphasizes the need for predictability and the ability to put internal meetings on the calendar for the entire year to reduce surprises and increase productivity. Finally, Bourkoff talks about his approach to bonuses, which involves asking bankers what their edge is and focusing on their unique qualities and contributions.

Bourkoff also shares a story about a deal he brokered for Sundance Channel, in which the question of his compensation came up after the deal was done.

The first book is called "Cities of Desperation," which talks about how cities reinvent themselves and become more dynamic and adaptable. The second book is titled "Scarcity," which focuses on how to deal with scarce resources, especially at a time when there is a scarcity of food and energy resources. The third book is "The Second Mountain" by David Brooks, which discusses finding personal development and joy in the climb towards achieving one's professional and life goals. Additionally, Bourkoff shares that he enjoys reading biographies and mystery novels, and among his favorites are Ayn Rand and John Steinbeck.

In this section of the video, Tim Ferriss asks Aryeh Bourkoff about the future of the podcast market. According to Bourkoff, the audio and podcast market is strong and growing, but the quality must rise to the top and be curated. Bourkoff predicts that more curation, branding, monetization, and social features will be important, as well as interaction between fans and creators. He believes that it's still early in the podcast market, and the best is yet to come, with differentiated global content and more platforms getting behind it.

Additionally, Tim Ferriss brings up the possibility of cross-asset utilization of podcast personalities and how the value of a personality may increase when viewed as being applied to various platforms. They both discuss how these trends may affect negotiations for talent deals and the future of media as a whole.

Bourkoff shares how in his past career as a goalkeeper, he rejected 40 out of 45 potential deals, recognizing the need to play the long game and only do business with the best companies, rather than accept mediocrity. Both agree on the importance of planning for excellence and not being afraid to say no to opportunities that don't align with their quality standards.

01:35:00
In this section, Aryeh Bourkoff discusses his preference for doing fewer things with quality than scaling things for the sake of scalability. He emphasizes the importance of playing for excellence and quality all the time, which requires plenty of structure and scaled intimacy. Bourkoff shares a story about the Mach2 - a whiskey-based drink with Chartreuse and ginger - which is only served at The Hemingway Bar at the Ritz Hotel in Paris.

01:40:00
