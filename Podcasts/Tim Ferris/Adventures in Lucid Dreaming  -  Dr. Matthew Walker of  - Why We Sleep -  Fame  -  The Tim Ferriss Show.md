The video discusses the phenomenon of lucid dreaming, which is defined as being aware that one is dreaming while dreaming. The video discusses the research into lucid dreaming and how it has led to advances in neuroscience. The video discusses a study that showed that lucid dreaming does not require the prefrontal cortex to be active. The jury is still out on the idea that electrical bursts from the brain are responsible for lucid dreaming. While lucid dreaming can be extremely pleasurable, it can also be mentally taxing. The state of the art from a scientific perspective is that lucid dreaming is not a new construct, but has been practiced for thousands of years. There are various methods used to induce lucidity, but the most prevalent is training the brain to become lucid while dreaming.

The "mild method" for inducing lucid dreaming is a method of consciously remembering that you're dreaming, and repeating that intention throughout the night before bed. The "reality testing method" is a technique of testing reality during the waking day, in a way that you don't normally do.
