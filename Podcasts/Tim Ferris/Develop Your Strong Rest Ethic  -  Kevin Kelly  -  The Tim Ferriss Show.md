Kelly argues that engaging in leisure activities and taking breaks, such as sabbaticals, are essential to creativity and living a fulfilling life. While sabbaticals are often associated with taking a break every seven years, Kelly advocates for taking a break whenever a shift in perspective is needed.

In this section, Kevin Kelly, a philosopher and founding editor of Wired Magazine, shares why having a good rest ethic is crucial for a productive work ethic. He believes that taking sabbaticals or breaks, engaging in leisure activities, and recharging oneself are vital to living a creative life. Kelly thinks that sabbaticals are not necessarily taken every seven years, but rather any time one needs a shift in perspective. He recommends setting a different rhythm or mode by engaging oneself in activities that are different from usual. Sabbaticals that help with this can be anything from reading a book all day to traveling to a foreign location, and the duration should be long enough to make it effective, like six weeks at a minimum.
