00:05:00
In this section, Michael Mauboussin, author and head of consilient research at Counterpoint Global, talks about two unofficial mottos of his course and how they reflect his approach to learning and teaching. The first motto, "nullius in verba," which means "take nobody's word for it," encourages people to question everything and find out for themselves. The second one, attributed to Carl Gauss, is "Notions not notations," which emphasizes the importance of grasping underlying ideas before focusing on equations and computation. Mauboussin also discusses how his lack of formal business education was actually an asset on Wall Street when he first started out.

00:10:00
In this section, Michael Mauboussin discusses his approach to understanding things from first principles and how it helped him in his career in finance. He talks about the importance of questioning old rules of thumb and relying on a beginner's mind to truly understand how things work. Mauboussin shares the insight he gained from reading Val Rappaport's book "Creating Shareholder Value," which emphasized the importance of understanding cash flows, value creation, and the relationship between valuation and strategy. Additionally, Mauboussin shares his experience working with an exceptional analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert who had a unique focus on cash flows, asset values, and direct communication with management teams.

00:15:00
In this section, Michael Mauboussin explains how he became a food analyst and defines "consilience," a term in his job title that he often had to explain. He learned about the food industry from an individual he followed and became an analyst in that field because of his interest in that individual’s analytical prowess. "Consilience" is about the unification of knowledge and became the verb associated with it. Mauboussin launched a newsletter called "The Consilient Observer," where he wrote short essays shining a different light on various topics, which ended up being compiled and published into a book that shared the greatest hits of The Consilient Observer. Mauboussin discusses how EO Wilson inspired him to become interested in bringing ideas together from different disciplines to tackle bigger problems that exist at the intersections of disciplines.

00:20:00
In this section, Michael Mauboussin explains how understanding markets as complex adaptive systems has been a valuable insight for investors. He discusses how the classic efficient markets theory is flawed, and how complex adaptive systems can offer a better explanation. Mauboussin also notes that the key to understanding complex systems is the study of emergent phenomena, and highlights the importance of cognitive diversity, rather than social category diversity or values diversity, in solving problems.

00:25:00
In this section, Michael Mauboussin discusses the importance of cognitive diversity and how it can lead to better problem-solving and corporate success. He cites Scott E. Page's work on this topic, which demonstrates mathematically why diversity adds value. Mauboussin also shares his experience co-chairing the diversity advisory board for Credit Suisse and how the CEO believed in the cognitive diversity argument. Mauboussin then talks about the "wisdom of crowds" concept, which refers to the idea that the collective intelligence of a group is better than that of any individual, citing examples of the jelly bean guessing exercise and the Solomon Ash experiment.

00:30:00
In this section, Michael Mauboussin discusses social conformity and the experiment conducted by Solomon Asch in which participants were asked to identify the correct answer to a question on a vision test. While the subject initially provided the correct answer, when the Confederates around them provided the wrong answer, many participants lost confidence and went with the crowd. Mauboussin replicates this experiment every year with his business students and finds that while individuals may be off by 50%, the collective guess is more accurate than any individual within the group. Cognitive diversity is key to this. Mauboussin cites Scott Page's diversity prediction theorem which states that the collective error of the group is a function of the accuracy of each individual and cognitive diversity. However, Mauboussin clarifies that having the right expertise for a particular task is crucial and in many cases, a single specialist may be better than a group.

00:35:00
In this section, Michael Mauboussin discusses how groups of people can come up with better answers than individual experts due to the "wisdom of crowds." He suggests that using an audience of around 10-20 million people to conduct experiments could be valuable and fun, and proposes two games as examples. The first involves predicting the winners of the Academy Awards by popular vote (rather than who they think should win), while the second game involves guessing a number between zero to one hundred, with the winner being the person who guesses closest to two-thirds of the average of everyone else's guesses. He also notes that the latter game has an equilibrium solution (zero) and reminds the audience that sometimes, groups aren't always right even if they are smarter than any individual.

00:40:00
In this section, Michael Mauboussin discusses an interesting exercise called the two-thirds game that he experienced during a meeting with world leaders in Switzerland. The game, which involved negotiation and risk, demonstrated the importance of understanding the position of others and the basics of empathy. Mauboussin then suggests running prediction experiments with his audience, inspired by Phil Tetlock's forecasting tournaments, to see if they could be super forecasters. He also recommends two books, Against the Gods by Peter Bernstein and Complexity by Mitchell Waldrop, for their insights into risk and the history of human understanding of risk.

00:45:00
In this section, Michael Mauboussin discusses two books that have influenced him: Against the Gods by Peter Bernstein and Complexity by Mitchell Waldrop. Against the Gods is a history of risk and how we understand it, from the Bernoullis in the 1700s to the present day. Complexity is about the founding of the Santa Fe Institute, which is focused on understanding complex, adaptive systems. Mauboussin also emphasizes the importance of understanding the history of ideas and where they originated from, in order to gain a better understanding of a subject.

00:50:00
In this section, Michael Mauboussin discusses why value investors tend to be drawn towards the Santa Fe Institute, highlighting the type of people that tend to be self-selected to be interested in the ideas that come out of it. He describes how investors tend to be a fun group to hang out with because they are curious learners who read widely and think a lot about different disciplines. Mauboussin also emphasizes the importance of observing and studying investors, as they have a report card in many cases, so you can look at the returns for some of them, which he finds very refreshing.

00:55:00
In this section, Michael Mauboussin discusses the decline of public companies in the US and the rise of private equity. He attributes the decline in public companies to fewer IPOs and more mergers and acquisitions. In turn, an increase in private equity has emerged as a way to accommodate the lower expected returns in public markets. The conversation then shifts to the power of base rates, which involves analyzing a problem as an instance of a larger reference class. Using a combination of the inside and outside view can lead to better and more accurate predictions.

01:00:00
In this section, Michael Mauboussin discusses the 2008 Belmont horse race and the likelihood of Big Brown winning the Triple Crown with a 77% probability of winning the Belmont. Based on base rates, it was observed that only 40% of horses in similar positions succeeded in winning the Triple Crown, with only three of the 20 attempts after 1958 succeeding, suggesting that 77% was an overestimation of Big Brown's chances. Furthermore, while Big Brown was considered a favorite due to his impressive track record, he had the slowest speed figures compared to other Triple Crown contenders in the past seven years, all of which had failed. The diversity breakdown also occurs, with many people excitedly betting on the Triple Crown contender due to the rarity of such an event, leading to market inefficiencies. Mauboussin suggests that when making decisions, assessing an appropriate reference class and base rates can provide valuable information.

01:05:00
In this section, Michael Mauboussin discusses the limitations of genetic diversity in horses and how this affects their speed. He then goes on to discuss what separates good from great investors and states that it has little to do with analytical tools and more to do with how they make decisions. Mauboussin highlights overconfidence and confirmation bias as difficult biases to circumvent and updating views objectively and anti-social decision-making as vital components to investing success. He also recommends Robert Sapolsky's book, "Behave," as the best book he has read on human nature.

01:10:00
In this section, Michael Mauboussin discusses the effects of stress on investors and how it can lead to a shortened time horizon. He explains that stress triggers the same physiological response in humans as physical threats do in animals, leading to the body turning the stress response on and never turning it off. This can cause several symptoms, such as being sick all the time and having problems with the gut and reproductive systems. Mauboussin emphasizes the importance of investors maintaining equanimity and keeping their eyes on the horizon, even during times of stress, to avoid shortening their time horizons. Additionally, Mauboussin highlights the importance of intellectual curiosity and continually seeking to improve one's craft for successful investors. Lastly, he discusses the importance of considering alternate possibilities in decision-making to avoid common mental missteps.

01:15:00
In this section of the transcript, Michael Mauboussin discusses techniques to expand one's possibilities and avoid making the same mistakes twice. He mentions utilizing base rates, conducting pre-mortems, and red teaming to broaden one's perspective. Additionally, he emphasizes the importance of counterfactuals, building off of learning from failures, and being open-minded. When asked about his favorite failure, Mauboussin cites his experience as a stockbroker, which led him to develop the concept of skill matching.

01:20:00
In this section, Michael Mauboussin discusses the difference between experience and expertise and explains that true experts are those with a predictive model that works. As algorithms become more prevalent, many experts are being squeezed out of certain domains, although in others, the wisdom of crowds can outperform experts. Mauboussin warns against over-reliance on experts, particularly in complex domains where experts can offer wildly differing opinions, citing climate change as a prime example. Instead, he suggests considering the inputs and models generated by various experts and comparing them to reach a decision.

01:25:00
In this section, Michael Mauboussin discusses the idea of intuition and how it relates to decision-making. He explains that intuition is an automatic answer that comes to the mind due to training in a specific domain. However, intuition tends to be way over-weighted and overestimated. It can only work effectively if the system is stable and linear. Intuition also has a sampling problem, as people only talk about the successful ideas that come to them and not the failures. Mauboussin believes that eradicating biases is part and parcel of the system, and that failures become more apparent in stable and linear systems.

01:30:00
In this section of the interview, Michael Mauboussin and Tim Ferriss discuss the concept of intuition and its role in decision making, specifically in sports and investing. Mauboussin presents the idea that experts often work in a way that is different from the average person when it comes to pattern recognition and chunking, but the key question is understanding where these methods are effective and where they are not. Mauboussin also touches on the importance of time management and how he balances his various responsibilities as an investor, author, and parent.

01:35:00
In this section, Michael Mauboussin talks about the importance of having a supportive life partner and being organized in life. He believes that having a good relationship with a partner who is supportive and understanding helps amplify everything, making everything better. Mauboussin enjoys learning, reading, and understanding things at first principles, which motivates him to keep growing. To perform at a high level cognitively, he focuses on getting eight hours of sleep, exercising, and being careful with his diet. Mauboussin recounts how sleep deprivation affected his productivity in the past, emphasizing that focusing on sleep makes a significant difference in his performance.

01:40:00
In this section, Michael Mauboussin discusses the things he tries to avoid, which include addictive behaviors and heavy drinking, as well as being mindful of how he spends his time. He also shares insights on parenting, referencing the work of Judith Rich Harris and her book "The Nurture Assumption," which suggests that nature plays a significant role in how children turn out, rather than solely parenting. Additionally, Mauboussin mentions the importance of taking a circumspect approach to managing complex adaptive systems, such as ecosystems, economies, and climate issues, as they are difficult to model, think through, and manage.

01:45:00
In this section, Michael Mauboussin discusses the benefits of understanding complex adaptive systems, especially in terms of thinking about markets and making interventions. While acknowledging the difficulty of beating markets, he explains how recognizing them as complex adaptive systems can be liberating in terms of letting go of the misfounded belief that we can control them precisely. He suggests resources like Melanie Mitchell's book "Complexity: A Guided Tour" and the Santa Fe Institute's website for those interested in exploring this field. Finally, Mauboussin shares two quotes that he finds powerful, including "beliefs are hypotheses to be tested, not treasures to be protected" and "analysts who know the most about a situation have the most to unlearn when the world changes," emphasizing the importance of keeping an open, beginner's mind.

01:50:00
In this section, Michael Mauboussin shares his view on the importance of having people around us who are willing to ask naive questions, have fresh eyes, and not carry baggage. He also provides recommendations for where to start with his books, "Think Twice" and "The Success Equation," for those interested in becoming better thinkers and understanding luck and skill. He suggests "Expectations Investing" for serious investors and emphasizes the value of collaborating with those one admires and the role of luck in shaping one's path.

01:55:00
In this section, Michael Mauboussin talks about how he admires Tim Ferriss's work in helping people think and work better, especially in the domain of investing. He emphasizes the importance of sleep, exercise, and diet to improve cognitive performance and be really good performers in any cognitive domain. He also advises people to mind their P's and Q's when it comes to sleep and the fundamentals, as they are cognitive athletes, and their brains are not separate from the rest of their bodies. Finally, he talks about the value of building valuable relationships with experts who can help enhance one's understanding and ability to explain things.
