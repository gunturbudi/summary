In the early days of psychiatry, ketamine was used to treat depression and anesthesia was its primary use. However, the ketamine had no real understanding of how it worked and lacked a framework to use it. Dr. Krystal's father, a pioneer in the field of schizophrenia, helped him develop a research program around ketamine's glutamate receptor action.
