Author Kevin Kelly discusses the various types of artificial intelligence (AI) that are being engineered for specific tasks, with most being unseen in the infrastructure. He compares AI to artificial aliens that help humans come up with new ideas, but states that they are not conscious and will be narrow and obedient. Kelly notes that people should not be scared of AI, as tools will become more specialized and we won't even think about the majority of them. Additionally, he highlights the conversational interface as the next level of interfacing with machines that will provide a whole new level of communication between humans and machines, embedded in everything we use.

Kelly describes AI as artificial aliens, helping humans come up with new ideas that they wouldn't have thought of on their own, with comedy that is a little off. We shouldn't be scared of AI's, as they aren't conscious, and will be narrow and obedient. Kelly states that AI is currently under hyped: people should stop worrying about mass unemployment caused by AI's because tools will become more specialized and we won't even think about the majority of them.
