Paul Stamets, founder and president of Fungi Perfecti and author of "Mycelium Running" and "Growing Gourmet and Medicinal Mushrooms," discusses the significance of fungi, mycelium, and mushrooms with Tim Ferris on The Tim Ferris Show podcast. Stamets explains the evolutionary perspective of mycelium and fungi, his experience with carpenter ants and their intersection with mycelium, the anti-viral properties of mushrooms, and the patent on a fungus that is now open source. Stamets also recounts his experience growing up in a wealthy household in Ohio before his family lost everything, and how he stumbled upon the idea of using entomopathogenic fungi instead of toxic insecticides, which ultimately led to his discovery of mushrooms' potential to save both people and the planet.
Mycologist and author Paul Stamets discusses his passion for mushrooms and their potential to address environmental problems and benefit human health. He recounts transformative experiences with magic mushrooms, the potential benefits of psilocybin and Lion's Mane mushrooms for cognitive enhancement, and the importance of preserving knowledge from mental giants like Einstein. Stamets also highlights the power of kindness and collaboration and describes the various ways that mushrooms can be used for waste water filtration, pesticides, medicines, reforestation, humanitarian aid, and even space travel. Finally, he discusses the critical dependence of our food system on bees, the problems associated with colony collapse, and his investigation of using mushrooms to help save bees.
Mycologist Paul Stamets discusses the potential benefits of using extracts from mycelium in mushrooms to improve animal and human resistance to diseases, such as reducing viruses like the deformed wing virus in bees. Stamets believes that fungal solutions can be ecologically rational, economically sustainable, and paradigm-shifting, with natural products potentially being more powerful than pharmaceuticals. He suggests practical solutions for individuals to help promote sustainability, such as allowing wood to rot, supporting bee research, and joining mushroom societies. Ferriss promotes his weekly email and two sponsors, Audible and Peloton, which offers a studio experience at home for fitness.

In this section, Tim Ferris introduces Paul Stamets, an industry leader in the habitats, medicinal use, and production of fungi. Stamets is the author of multiple books, including "Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World" and "Growing Gourmet and Medicinal Mushrooms." The discussion covers the importance of fungi, mycelium, and mushrooms, and Stamets' research in using mushroom extracts to reduce viruses that contribute to bee colony collapse. The conversation also touches on psychedelics, breaking the taboo surrounding fungi, and the benefits of using host defense mushroom supplements. Finally, Ferris recommends checking out Stamets' Instagram for amazing pictures of fungi and his latest study published in Nature scientific reports.

00:10:00
In this section of the podcast, Paul Stamets explains the definitions and pronunciation of fungi, mycelium, and mushrooms. Fungi is pronounced with a J, but mycologists from different countries may use different terms. Mycelium is the underground network that functions like a tree's roots, while mushrooms are the fruit bodies produced by the mycelium. The mycelial networks are vast and can run up to 8 miles per cubic inch, yet it only has one cell wall thick that protects itself from millions of hostile microbes. The mycelium is highly significant in habitat and human and plant health, and it can exist for decades before the single mushroom eons.

00:15:00
In this section, Paul Stamets discusses the evolutionary perspective of mycelium and fungi. He explains that mycology departments were once a subset of botany, but they should be included in zoology departments because fungi and Animalia, a new super Kingdom called a Pais LeConte ah, are joined together. Stamets highlights that mycelium is involved in gobbling up dead organic plant material that falls down to the sediments. He also emphasizes that we are descendants of fungi, which is why our best antibiotics come from fungi. Stamets then transitions from fungi to carpenter ants and discusses his history with carpenter ants and the intersection with mycelium.

00:20:00
In this section, Paul Stamets describes his experience growing up in a wealthy household in Ohio before his family lost everything, leading to a difficult period where he had to step up and help his mother. He became skilled at vacuuming and helping with household tasks, which would later tie in with his work in discovering how certain fungi could combat carpenter ants in an eco-friendly way. He explains how he stumbled upon the idea of using entomopathogenic fungi instead of toxic insecticides, which ultimately led to his discovery of mushrooms' potential to save both people and the planet.

00:25:00
In this section, Paul Stamets explains his interest in a group of fungi called meta RISM, which is non-toxic to humans and animals. He discovered that these fungi have the ability to prevent insects from coming near due to their spore repellency property. Despite its potential to replace rat poison and other toxic pesticides, the insect-repellent property prevented the fungi from being sold commercially. Stamets conducted experiments to grow the fungi without spores and was successful in creating a non-sporulating version of the fungus, which he used to prevent carpenter ants from destroying his workshop.

00:30:00
In this section, Paul Stamets recounts how he and his daughter discovered a solution to spore repellency in mushrooms. His daughter observed carpenter ants swarming around a dish of rice in the early morning and the ants took away all the myceliated rice. Stamets realized that he may have found a way to combat spore repellency. He discovered the opposite property of spore repellency, which is mycelial attraction, and he used this to create a super attractant which could be used against various insects. The extracts derived from the mycelium were also found to be a non-lethal alternative to pesticides. Stamets licensed out the technology for $1 million but ultimately pulled back the licensing agreement when the group failed to take it to market within the allotted time frame.

00:35:00
In this section, Paul Stamets discusses his experience working with the US Defense Department on the antiviral properties of mycelium. Stamets was contacted by a group of researchers in the US Defense Department who had been funded by Dick Cheney and George Bush in order to develop bio defense programs called project bio bio defense, which became known as the bio shield program. They saw potential in Stamets' work and sent him 100 sets of samples for his extracts of mushrooms that could have antiviral properties. Stamets initially thought the research was ineffective after going through 77 pages of no results, but he found that the results of the 78th sample up to 88th sample showed high activity against poxviruses. These samples came from an old-growth mushroom called a gerakan.

00:40:00
In this section, Paul Stamets discusses the anti-viral properties of mushrooms, specifically the results he has seen with ganoderma mushrooms against pox, flu, and herpes viruses. Stamets admits that the results are based on in vitro testing with human cells and that further testing is needed before they can be applied to living hosts. He also shares an interesting story about a security breach involving his lab and a misplaced FedEx package that contained his research reports.

00:45:00
In this section, Paul Stamets discusses the time when the Department of Defense confiscated his patent for the Gerrard Converse, a virus that he discovered could be useful in immunizing crops. After filing a patent for the virus in 2004, it did not appear on the US Patent and Trademark Office website for over two years. When his patent attorney investigated the issue, they discovered that the Department of Defense had taken it out of the queue due to national security concerns. Eventually, Stamets was able to get the patent approved in 2014, 10 years after submitting the application. He explains that patents are important for incentivizing inventors to bring their creations to market and are awarded based on three factors: no prior art, being unobvious, and usefulness.

00:50:00
In this section, Paul Stamets discusses the patent on a fungus that is now open source and is the first fungus ever to be allowed for controlling insects in food handling facilities. This makes it safe to use and commercialize, but only with EPA registration. Stamets explains that the method for doing this is published and his entire portfolio has been submitted to a well-known company with an extremely potent insecticide. The company's response was that they do not want to disrupt their proven profit wheel and prefer to have consumers buying their toxic chemicals every month. Stamets believes that this fungus is a ten-year solution that costs only about twenty-five cents to produce and can control the entire colony after a spoilage, preventing future invasions with its spore-repellency property. However, it did not make it to the market.

00:55:00
In this section, Paul Stamets, the founder and president of Fungi Perfecti, talks about how he started stuttering when he was just five years old, which had a severe impact on his social life. He learned that he could trick his brain by using alternative pathways via prepositional or adverbial phrases but could still not speak normally. His love for science began at a young age when his brother John, a chemistry enthusiast, created a laboratory in their basement, and Stamets inherited it when his brothers left for college. Stamets became intrigued with altered states of consciousness after reading Charles Hart's book titled Altered States of Consciousness, which was a book filled with research articles detailing ways to change one's consciousness. His mentor and hero, John, who went to Mexico and Colombia, came back with exciting stories of consuming magic mushrooms.

01:00:00
In this section, Paul Stamets recounts the story of how he got interested in mushrooms. It started when his brother lent him a counterculture book about mushrooms, which he then gave to a friend to borrow. However, his friend's father burned the book, which upset Paul greatly. This event led him to explore the subject and eventually into his interest in magic mushrooms. As a teenager, he experimented with drugs and discovered the benefits of marijuana and using mushrooms to overcome his stuttering habit. He then recounts a story of eating 10 to 20 grams of dried cubensis mushrooms, which he harvested in Ohio, and climbing a tree during a thunderstorm.

01:05:00
In this section, Paul Stamets recounts a transformative experience he had during a lightning storm while he was up in a tree. He reflects on his stuttering habit, which he viewed as his biggest issue at the time, and started repeating to himself "stop stuttering now" repeatedly to overcome it. After the storm cleared, he encountered a girl he admired and was surprised to speak to her flawlessly without stuttering. This experience solidified Stamets' belief in the transformative power of nature and encouraged him to pursue the study and cultivation of mushrooms to help heal people and the planet.

01:10:00
In this section, mycologist and author Paul Stamets recounts his relationship with Bill Webb, a close friend and father figure who introduced him to sacred mushroom journeys. Stamets describes how, weeks before he died, Webb confided that he had found something medically important about psilocybin mushrooms: while in a state of heightened perception, Webb was able to hear the footsteps of ants crawling on his deck. Stamets believes that more research should be conducted on the effects of psilocybin on hearing, as it could lead to promising medical applications.

01:15:00
In this section, Paul Stamets discusses the potential benefits of psilocybin mushrooms and the challenges of commercializing them as a therapeutic drug. He mentions that psilocybin mushrooms are not drugs of abuse, but rather powerful substances that should be recategorized as a therapeutic drug. However, their effectiveness in single or limited doses makes commercialization difficult, as it does not require frequent administration. Stamets also notes the increasing importance of mycelium, the vegetative part of a fungus, as a source of beneficial bioactive molecules that can provide a greater benefit than mushrooms.

01:20:00
In this section, Paul Stamets discusses the importance of the fungal microbiome and how it determines the bacterial microbiome. He explains that the mycelium is a network that responds to environmental stimuli and upregulates gene expressions, making it a fertile ground for learning and articulating responses to environmental challenges. Stamets talks about the unique qualities of mushrooms - as something ephemeral and difficult to understand because of their unpredictability. He explains that there are around 200 species of edible and medicinal mushrooms, most with medicinal properties. Stamets discusses the Lion's Mane mushroom, which has strong neuro-growth factors that regenerate the myelin on the axons of nerves. This is why the mushroom is being studied for its potential applications to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Stamets also mentions that lion's mane, which is perfectly legal, is one mushroom he takes every day, and he believes stacked with psilocybin, could be a remarkable treatment for neuro-pathologies.

01:25:00
In this section, mycologist Paul Stamets discusses how lion's mane mushrooms have been shown to have the ability to regenerate myelin and can offer potential benefits for those dealing with cognitive decline or dysfunction. Stamets stresses the importance of preserving the knowledge of mental giants like Einstein or ecology mentors, and highlights that losing these geniuses is like losing a library. The conversation moves onto the potential for using micro doses of psilocybin to stimulate neurogenesis under supervised and researched conditions, and Stamets talks about a patent he has filed that stacks lion's mane, psilocybin, and nicotinic acid to create neurogenesis.

01:30:00
In this section, Paul Stamets discusses the potential benefits of microdosing psilocybin and Lion's Mane mushrooms for cognitive enhancement. He highlights the need for clinical studies to be conducted in order to fully understand the effects of microdosing on the brain. Stamets explains that sub-threshold doses are a valid approach to take, but taking them every day could cause receptor normalization. Pulse therapy, where the mushrooms are taken for a few days on and a few off, may be a better approach. Stamets also emphasizes the non-toxicity and effectiveness of psilocybin and its potential for widespread medicinal use. Finally, he talks about his mushroom expertise, noting that his success as a mycologist is due to his native curiosity and keen sense of observation.

01:35:00
In this section of the transcript, Paul Stamets discusses his early life, how a circle of kindness and belief in karma has guided him to where he is now, and his journey into martial arts where he has achieved two black belts and taught for 30-40 years. He shares a story about a particularly violent fight he had as a young black belt where rather than continuing to attack his opponent once he had won, he extended his hand in friendship which ultimately changed the biker's life. Stamets weaves in the idea that collaboration is key--not just between people but also with nature which leads to a discussion of mushrooms and their potential to save humanity from environmental disaster.

01:40:00
In this section, Paul Stamets explains his belief in the power of kindness, particularly in small acts that can have a significant impact on others' lives. He shares the story of a friend who brought a Dunkin' Donuts employee to tears simply by expressing gratitude. Stamets also discusses how his business sends "You Are Beautiful" stickers with every order and how this simple act of affirmation has transformed people's experiences. Ultimately, Stamets believes that we are all interconnected in a network-based paradigm, and our lives are part of the wider fabric of nature. He sees fungi as a possible key to addressing human environmental problems, as mushrooms could be used to break down pollutants and contaminants.

01:45:00
In this section, Paul Stamets discusses the various ways that mushrooms can have positive impacts on the environment and human health. The mycelium of mushrooms can be used for waste water filtration, pesticides, medicines, reforestation, crop improvement, famine relief, and even space travel. Stamets also mentions the Wood Wide Web and how mycelium facilitates communication among trees and other organisms. He recommends his book "Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World" and a website called Fungi.com, which shares a letter from a Syrian refugee who has been growing mushrooms in refugee camps using recyclable materials. Stamets believes that mycelium is the foundation of the food web and essential for food biosecurity. He also talks about "Fantastic Fungi," a movie he helped create that explores the world of mushrooms.

01:50:00
In this section, Paul Stamets discusses the critical dependence of our food system on bees and the problems associated with colony collapse. He highlights factors like habitat loss, neonicotinoids, factory farming, and pesticide exposure as being responsible for the current scenario with respect to bees. The biggest identifiable problem is the varroa mite, which was introduced in 1987 and injects numerous viruses into bees. The borough of mite, which spreads this virus, was initially controlled by a miticide called Amma tries but has now developed a resistance to it, causing problems for beekeepers.

01:55:00
In this section, Paul Stamets discusses the importance of wild bees in pollinating crops, and the threat that viral infections pose to their populations. According to Stamets, wild bees provide over 80% of the pollination services that benefit agriculture, and viral infections have been spreading quickly among them due to mites and flower visits. This loss of bees is a direct threat to worldwide food biosecurity, and it is becoming a bridge issue between liberals and conservatives. Stamets describes several experiences that led him to investigate the use of mushrooms to help save bees, including the observation of bees attracted to the mycelium of a garden giant mushroom in his backyard.

02:00:00
In this section, mycologist Paul Stamets discusses his research on the effects of mycelial extracts of polypore mushrooms on bees, especially in reducing the damaging impact of the deformed wing virus. This virus has been found in abandoned beehives along with the lack of peak Americ acid, an essential nutrient for detoxification pathways and funguses. Stamets found that one dosage of 1% of the mushroom extract given to bees reduced viruses by hundreds and thousands of times. This breakthrough could help save the bees and restore their population, which would have positive economic and environmental impacts.

02:05:00
In this section, Paul Stamets discusses the beneficial relationship between mycelium and animal inhabitants. Extracts from mycelium play a role in people and animal's defense and resistance against diseases, reducing viruses like bird flu, herpes viruses, and poxviruses. This is important information in a world experiencing the sixth great extinction with thousands of species being lost each year. Stamets believes that fungal solutions can be ecologically rational, economically sustainable, and paradigm-shifting, with natural products potentially being more powerful than pharmaceuticals. People who want to help can learn about the benefits of mycelium and spread the knowledge.

02:10:00
In this section, Paul Stamets suggests some practical solutions for individuals looking to be a part of environmental and systemic solutions. One simple thing people can do is allow wood to rot instead of hauling it off, which encourages the growth of mushrooms that help feed bees and create biodiversity critical for sustainability. Stamets encourages supporting bee research and joining mushroom societies, as well as supporting farmers in the development of biodiverse landscapes. He emphasizes the importance of thinking about downstream generations and creating long-term sustainability, rather than making money in the short term. Ultimately, he argues that embracing nature and the principles of mycology can have enormous benefits, even if the field is currently underfunded and underappreciated.

02:15:00
In this section, Paul Stamets talks about the importance of creating legacies that truly care for other people and that will be heralded in the future. He emphasizes the need for a revolution and for people to take action, encouraging his listeners to step up and show a better way of acting towards others. Stamets also highlights the need for doctors and medical professionals to become more familiar with the latest research on mycology and fungi, and provides various resources and links for those interested in learning more.
