In this section, Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses his sleep stack that he uses to facilitate good sleep. The stack consists of magnesium three and eight, theanine, apogenin, and occasionally 900 milligrams of myoinositol. He adds that the primary contributors to good sleep include exercise and light exposure; sleep tracking bands sometimes misinterpret movements and suggest recommendations, but sleep tracking mattresses like Innate Sleep are more accurate. Additionally, he explains how one can avoid waking up to urinate at night by sipping final beverages and consuming heavy amounts of liquid in the morning instead. Huberman mentions that if he had to choose only two from his sleep stack, he would choose magnesium three and eight and apogenin, but theanine should be avoided by those who experience robust dreams or nightmares.
