Dr. Andrew Huberman explains the value of the physiological sigh, which entails taking a double inhale and exhale to offload excess carbon dioxide and rapidly reduce stress levels. By inflating the lungs' sacs and expelling carbon dioxide from the bloodstream, the body's heart rate variability is increased. Emphasizing exhales slows heart rate and has been clinically known as respiratory sinus arrhythmia.

In this section, Dr. Andrew Huberman explains the physiological sigh, a breathing pattern that can rapidly reduce stress levels. The physiological sigh was discovered by physiologists in the 30s, and it engages deep breathing to offload excess carbon dioxide rapidly, inflating the lungs' sacs, reducing stress levels significantly. The protocol involves taking a double inhale and exhale, inflating the sacs of the lungs, and expelling carbon dioxide from the bloodstream. Exhaling is essential to create heart rate variability (HRV), which is vital in calming the body. Whenever exhales are emphasized, the brain slows down the heart rate and clinically known as respiratory sinus arrhythmia.
