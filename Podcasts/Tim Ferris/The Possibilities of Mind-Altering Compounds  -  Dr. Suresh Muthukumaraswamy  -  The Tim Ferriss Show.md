Dr. Suresh Muthukumaraswamy, an associate professor of psychopharmacology at the University of Auckland, explains the trend of mental health issues increasing in New Zealand and the United States, leading to a discussion of breakthrough therapeutics and alternative treatments for mental health. He suggests that ketamine has potential as a rapid antidepressant, compared to traditional SSRIs that take 6 to 8 weeks to take effect. Muthukumaraswamy highlights the challenges of conducting clinical trials with mind-altering compounds due to the subjective nature of mental health diagnoses and the limited understanding of how they work. He also suggests the need for government support and funding for mental health research and emphasizes the importance of systematic research and manipulating therapeutic factors to gain a better understanding of the potential benefits and risks of using these compounds in treating mental health disorders.
In this episode of The Tim Ferriss Show, Tim Ferriss and Dr. Suresh Muthukumaraswamy discuss the use of mind-altering compounds such as LSD and psilocybin for therapeutic purposes. They stress the importance of accurate dosing and purity of supply, as well as the need for proper training and certification for those administering psychedelic therapy. The conversation also touches on the importance of safety, the potential risks of rushing the development of these compounds, and the need for more balanced gender representation in studies. The final section is an invitation from Tim Ferriss to his newsletter called "Five Bullet Friday."

Detail Summary:

In this section, Dr. Suresh Muthukumaraswamy, an associate professor of psychopharmacology at the University of Auckland, discusses the trend lines of mental health and addiction in New Zealand. He notes that according to the New Zealand Health Survey, the percentage of adults experiencing psychological distress has doubled over the last decade, with 9.6% of adults experiencing anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues in the last month. This sets the stage for a deeper conversation about breakthrough therapeutics and alternative treatments for mental health.

00:05:00
In this section of the video, Dr. Suresh Muthukumaraswamy discusses the trend of mental health issues such as depression and chronic anxiety increasing in both New Zealand and the United States. He mentions that he has studied various compounds, not just psychedelics, including anesthetics and gabaergic drugs. One such study investigated scopolamine, a muscarinic drug with potential rapid antidepressant effects, but unfortunately did not yield the expected results. The conversation then transitions to ketamine and its potential as a rapid antidepressant.

00:10:00
In this section, Dr. Suresh Muthukumaraswamy discusses the differences between classical psychedelics and ketamine. Classical psychedelics such as LSD and psilocybin work through the serotonin 2a receptor, generating a psychedelic experience. In contrast, ketamine's receptor binding sites are many and complicated, binding to NMDA receptors, GABA receptors, opiate receptors, and monoamine sites, among others. This complexity makes ketamine a very rich or dirty drug, depending on one's perspective. Ketamine has become an interesting drug to study as it has been found to produce a rapid remission of symptoms for treatment-resistant depression patients in hours, compared to traditional SSRIs' six to eight weeks of exertion with no guarantee of success at all.

00:15:00
In this section, Dr. Suresh Muthukumaraswamy discusses the potential that ketamine has on depression treatments. He describes how ketamine has changed something within the brain of patients, moving them from a depressed to a non-depressed state within a day. Ketamine appears to have a target that can be flicked like a switch, while other medications like SSRIs or transcranial magnetic stimulation take longer periods of time. Case studies have shown people who were acutely suicidal to have literally come out of ketamine therapy saying they don't know what they were so upset about, demonstrating what Dr. Muthukumaraswamy calls "rapid effects." There is less data on the durability of the anti-depression effects of ketamine therapy, although it is thought to exerminate a mechanistic explanation by fixing the "machinery" within the brain. In contrast, psilocybin has been tested with an intense amount of psychotherapy, with hours of preparation before the experience, with a therapist sitting with the patient through the experience itself, and with more hours and days on integration afterwards, thus making it difficult to separate the two issues' benefits.

00:20:00
In this section of the video, Dr. Suresh Muthukumaraswamy discusses the possibility of using ketamine with assisted psychotherapy, similar to the method used with psilocybin. He notes that while there have been studies on the use of ketamine, they have not included psychotherapeutic support. He also highlights the potential ethical issues in trying to find a "middle ground" between minimal and maximal levels of support for assisted therapy. He emphasizes that this is still a nascent period of psychedelic research and that there is much to explore in terms of study design and techniques such as fMRI. Dr. Muthukumaraswamy then explains how he picked his studies for LSD microdosing and the challenges of conducting a randomized controlled trial with placebo control when studying psychedelics. Finally, he defines microdosing as taking a very low dose of psychedelics and the reported benefits include improved mental well-being and concentration.

00:25:00
In this section, Dr. Suresh Muthukumaraswamy discusses the challenges of conducting clinical trials on microdosing psychedelics due to the legal classification of these substances. However, he notes that there is a loophole in New Zealand's drug regulations from 1977 and the Misuse of Drugs Act that allows for the prescription of class A substances, like psychedelics, for clinical trials. Muthukumaraswamy and his team engaged in a legal process with the Ministry of Health to provide the reasoning for why this could be done and got the necessary approvals to conduct a study on 80 healthy volunteers who were given a six-week LSD microdosing course. New Zealand's small size and agile regulatory environment also make it an attractive place to run clinical trials, with pharmaceutical companies investing in the country's psychedelics industry.

00:30:00
In this section, Dr. Suresh Muthukumaraswamy discusses the lack of dedicated government funding for mental health research in New Zealand. While there is general research funding available, mental health research has been consistently underfunded in New Zealand, despite the significant burden of disease it imposes on the population. There is no equivalent of the nimh or breakthrough therapy designation, which could encourage innovation and experimentation, however, Dr. Muthukumaraswamy suggests that New Zealand could follow the example of countries such as Australia and set aside specific funding for breakthrough mental health therapeutics, as a pump priming exercise to build capacity and infrastructure.

00:35:00
In this section, Dr. Suresh Muthukumaraswamy discusses the potential for New Zealand to become the tip of the spear in the field of psychedelic research, due to their ability to pilot and innovate in a way that is simply not possible in some larger places like the United States. He also highlights the work of other scientists, such as the research happening at the Liggins Institute, where they are studying preterm babies and doing really amazing interventional work. In terms of ketamine research, he discusses the interest in slow-release formulations and the work being done with different ketamine formulations, such as the R and S formulations, as well as the work of the group at Otago University who have been doing a lot of work with ketamine and various ketamine analogues.

00:40:00
In this section, Dr. Suresh Muthukumaraswamy discusses the challenges of getting ketamine approved as a treatment for depression due to the lack of a sponsoring company willing to invest in the research. However, he explains that ketamine has shown potential in treating a range of internalizing disorders beyond depression, such as anxiety and social anxiety. Additionally, researchers are exploring the potential of psychedelics to be used in a variety of conditions that share similar characteristics, such as rigidity in thought patterning. Dr. Muthukumaraswamy notes that the possibilities of this field are endless and researchers are still in the early stages of learning how mind-altering compounds can impact different disorders.

00:45:00
In this section, the speaker talks about the difficulties involved in clinical trials for mind-altering compounds due to the subjective nature of mental health diagnoses and the limited understanding of how the compounds work in the body. The interventions are complicated, and deconstructing what's going on is necessary. The speaker emphasizes the need for systematic research, including manipulation of therapeutic factors like wraparound therapy, gathering gold dust data points, and understanding individual requirements, such as the type of therapy patients need or talking to someone. The speaker notes the history of prohibition of substances like LSD, which happened more for political than scientific reasons, and the importance of the LSD microdosing study as a significant first step, including placebo controls at larger doses, which is incredibly challenging with psychedelics.

00:50:00
In this section, Dr. Suresh Muthukumaraswamy discusses the challenges of conducting placebo-controlled studies on mind-altering compounds such as LSD microdosing. The study used an inactive placebo to establish a pure safety group to look at physiological measures of safety and detect whether participants could notice the effects of the microdosing. The study found a variability in people's response to the microdosing and suggests that lightly active placebos might be needed in future trials when clinical outcomes are of interest. The blinding of the study is vital to prevent expectancy since participants might overestimate their clinical response. While the choice of the active placebo is not necessarily as crucial as what the participants believe they have consumed, blinding the study presents methodological problems that the field must work on. Dr. Muthukumaraswamy believes that these are fascinating issues to tackle in the scientific discipline, and exciting progress can be made.

00:55:00
In this section of the video, Dr. Suresh Muthukumaraswamy discusses the possibility of accelerating the benefits of mind-altering compounds by gaining government support and funding. He emphasizes the importance of philanthropic money to act as seed money and support early stages of research that can be used to establish feasibility and make it easier to obtain larger government grants. However, in terms of risks of microdosing, Dr. Muthukumaraswamy explains the need for caution when treating severe mental health disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with psychedelics due to the limited data set available. Furthermore, he warns about potential negative effects of taking synthetic psychedelic compounds that can be extremely dangerous and considers the legal ramifications of using such compounds.

01:00:00
In this section, Tim Ferriss and Dr. Suresh Muthukumaraswamy discuss the importance of the accuracy of dosing and purity of supply in mind-altering compounds such as LSD and psilocybin, emphasizing the legal and non-physiological risks of dealing with these Schedule 1 substances. It is crucial to bear in mind the potential dangers of misdosing or absorbing these compounds through the skin, leading to tragic outcomes, especially when used without supervision. Moreover, open science, where data is released to the world, and pre-registration could be beneficial in certain cases, but bad data could create more noise than helpful information in some instances. As legislation changes for access to psychedelic-assisted therapy happen, there will be a need to prepare the workforce to provide these services safely and effectively. Oregon is currently developing a parallel system for such registration and supervision.

01:05:00
In this section, Dr. Suresh Muthukumaraswamy discusses the creation of a certification program for psychedelic therapy, which can be applied to the existing psychiatry MD training. However, he emphasizes that the training is controversial, and developing a pipeline for training will be one of the most challenging issues faced in the next five to ten years. While there are experiments being done, he predicts that it will take two to five years for microdosing to progress depending on its results. Dr. Muthukumaraswamy stresses the importance of focusing on ketamine and MDMA-assisted psychotherapy rather than trying to handle all compounds simultaneously.

01:10:00
In this section, Dr. Suresh Muthukumaraswamy talks about the importance of prioritizing safety and avoiding rushing the process of developing mind-altering compounds to address unmet needs such as depression and anxiety. Rushing the process could result in safety issues and badly regulated compounds, leading to horror stories that can put us 50 years back in development. He also stresses the importance of mitigating the risk of catastrophe that could lead to political repercussions such as prohibition. The decision foundation is working on a law and policy project focused on psychedelics, including dealing with suicides and accidents caused by the drugs. The research is also expanding to explore addiction treatment, particularly Methamphetamine use or alcohol use. They are also planning to include women in studies in future trials, with steps being taken to expand the scope of research.

01:15:00
In this section, Dr. Suresh Muthukumaraswamy discusses the representation of females in their studies on mind-altering compounds and mentions that their future studies will include a more balanced gender ratio. He also talks about the potential use of microdosing for premenstrual dysphoric disorder and how studying medicine, psychology, or health sciences can be a good foundation for those interested in this type of research. The discussion delves into the clinical trials of corporations such as MindMed, Compass, and ATAI, as well as the red flags in pharmaceutical development. Tim Ferriss chimes in by emphasizing the importance of pre-registration and watching over intellectual property battles in the space.
