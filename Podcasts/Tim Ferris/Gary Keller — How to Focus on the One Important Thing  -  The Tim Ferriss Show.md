Sorry, this excerpt is actually an ad read and intro to the podcast episode, and does not contain any specific transcript excerpts related to Gary Keller's tips on focusing on the one important thing.

00:05:00
In this section, Tim Ferriss starts off the conversation by introducing Gary Keller and his best-selling books on real estate investing, including "The One Thing" and "Millionaire Real Estate Agent." Ferriss highlights Keller's new podcast, "Think Like a CEO," and then moves on to talking about Keller's childhood and how he stumbled upon a career in real estate. After graduating from college with no real plan, Keller's dad had him shadow different professionals, including an accountant, banker, lawyer, and realtor. It was the realtor that caught Keller's eye, and he ultimately went on to pursue a degree in real estate and start his career in Austin.

00:10:00
In this section, Gary Keller talks about his experience with a behavioral profile assessment that he took during his senior year in college. He interviewed with New York Life, but he was rejected because he did not match the profile of their successful salespeople. He was so angry that he chose to pursue real estate instead because he believed in responding strongly to rejection. He followed the books of the best real estate trainers and became a successful real estate agent by executing their playbook. He later applied for a management position in the largest firm in the city, but he was rejected again.

00:15:00
In this section, Gary Keller shares the story of how he got hired as a real estate agent by a multimillionaire businessman. Keller asked for a job when he saw that the environment in the office was not conducive to his goals as a salesperson, and the businessman gave him a test with a list of tasks to accomplish. Keller had no training but managed to recruit people to the firm and teach. After a year and a half of doing this, the company did something that created a problem in his office, and he went in to resign. The tables turned when the owner asked Keller what it would take to keep him, so Keller wrote down a number on a sheet of paper, the largest sum he had ever guaranteed anyone, and the owner agreed to it.

00:20:00
In this section, the speaker describes a negative experience he had with Gary Keller, the co-founder of Keller Williams, that led to him quitting. Keller had changed a policy about how people get paid on Christmas Eve, which resulted in many experienced employees leaving and the office being destroyed. The speaker offered to quit but was convinced by Keller to stay and rebuild the business. However, he was later called by Keller demanding to know what he had done, which led to the speaker quitting for good. Despite this negative experience, the speaker went on to become a successful entrepreneur by starting Keller Williams with Joe Williams, forming two companies, one residential, and one commercial.

00:25:00
In this section, Gary Keller discusses the concept of not taking on debt to try to grow faster, but rather being smart with money so that money doesn't leave you. Although he admits to using debt to buy real estate in the past, he stresses that he wants to be smart with money and be in control of his financial situation. Keller also explains that he didn't need a lot of money to build a real estate business because you can come in with minimal investment and work your way up from being a salesperson to owning a real estate business. He was able to leverage his way to becoming the largest office in Austin and worldwide by understanding the value proposition of attracting and retaining great people. Keller's key takeaway is that it doesn't take all that money to build a real estate company; it takes smart money instead of a lot of money.

00:30:00
In this section, Gary Keller, founder of Keller Williams Realty, talks about hitting a red light in his career when he realized he was losing money on his commercial side business. He and his partner didn't have an agreement stating that they had to give each other money, so Keller decided to stop giving his partner money to cover the losses. The dissolution was handled amicably, and Keller emphasizes the importance of having a disagreement instead of an agreement in partnership contracts, which should include clauses for control, decision-making, cash flow, and breakup. He shares a personal experience of negotiating a divorce settlement with his former boss, highlighting the importance of anticipating and planning for a breakup in advance.

00:35:00
In this section, Gary Keller talks about the importance of having separate counsel in personal relationships, like marriage, and the need to have a buy-sell agreement in case of parting ways. He shares the story of his failed buy-sell agreement during his divorce and how having the same attorney as his ex-wife resulted in the agreement being thrown out. Keller also emphasizes the importance of thinking through worst-case scenarios and setting plans to cap the downside. He mentions that he always looks at the termination clause in every contract he receives, and that having a plan for disagreement is vital. Finally, he shares a personal story where a prenuptial agreement could have saved his father-in-law's assets but was unfortunately not honored due to the onset of dementia.

00:40:00
In this section, Gary Keller talks about the importance of having a power of attorney document in place in case someone becomes incapacitated. He shared a personal story of how this helped his father-in-law's estate when he was diagnosed with dementia. He also mentioned the relevance of the franchise document in Keller Williams and how they innovated franchising through regional ownerships. Ferriss asked Keller about his ability to focus, which Keller is famous for, and Keller agreed to discuss the topic later in the interview.

00:45:00
section is about franchising, specifically the flawed approach to franchising known as the master franchise approach. Keller cites Dairy Queen as an example of such an approach. The sub-franchisor has rights to the franchises and becomes a franchisor of the franchisees, and so on. The problem with this is that the franchise business becomes smaller than it could be. Keller points out that while the financial opportunity remains the same, his own company did something different. Instead of sub-franchising, they created regional representative agreements, which allow for the same financial opportunities but don't give them the same level of authority as sub-franchisors. He emphasizes the importance of carefully reading franchise documents before signing them since any rights not explicitly stated will default to the franchisee.

00:50:00
In this section of the video, Gary Keller tells the story of Ray Kroc and the McDonald's brothers, and how they discovered the secret to their delicious French fries. Kroc had been struggling with replicating the taste of the fries in his own franchises, so he called the brothers to ask for help. They ultimately discovered that the secret wasn't in cooking the fries, but in curing the potatoes in open-air burlap sacks, which turned out to be the true innovation of the McDonald's brothers. This discovery enabled Kroc to successfully franchise and build the McDonald's empire. This story leads into Keller's own story, where he faced financial difficulties, including a divorce and a need to sign a note to the bank, and ultimately led to his decision to take a year off in 1989.

00:55:00
In this section, Gary Keller, co-founder of Keller Williams Realty, describes how his life changed when he realized that his current earnings path wasn't leading to exponential growth and he was in debt. After losing five of his top ten producers to a competitor, he needed a new plan that would help his business hop higher. Keller created the plan, which made his company the largest real estate company in Austin a year later, paid everyone off in cash the following year, and became the number one company in his city. He also hired someone to follow him around and document every brilliant thing he did, as well as created an operating manual to show how to launch and run a successful business.

01:00:00
In this section, Gary Keller discusses how he built his real estate franchise in 1989. He talks about how he hired a franchise attorney to help him build the document and learned from competitors and McDonald's documents. He also explains how he wanted to build a regional representative approach rather than a mastering franchise. He ended up creating 19 manuals, each focusing on a different issue, to help him build his franchise document. The document became the most valuable asset of the company and is still in use today. He also shares that he still uses a month-at-a-glance calendar and a pencil, even though his company is heavily invested in technology. He believes that simple methods are often the most effective.

01:05:00
In this section, Gary Keller shares the importance of using a physical monthly planner to plan personal and professional goals in order to hit targets. He notes that by using an eraser, it forces you to replace the task with something else, ensuring nothing is forgotten. Keller emphasizes that this method of planning not only cultivates awareness, but also helps travelers with spacing time off and vacations, as well as helps them fine-tune their lives. This goes against the digital time management way of planning that most people use nowadays, but Keller firmly believes that the physical planner helps people be more aware of their lives.

01:10:00
In this section, Gary Keller discusses his method for time blocking and the importance of focusing on the one important thing in order to achieve success. Keller explains that he uses time blocking to manage his energy and ensure he has enough time for the things that matter most in his life. He also shares that he only time blocks two to three hours a day to focus on his core business activity and compares this to going to the movies, where one is there exclusively to watch the film and is uninterrupted. This leads to a discussion on the focusing question, which is "what's the one thing I can do such that by doing it, everything else will be easier or unnecessary?" This question is regarded as extremely important in the early years of entrepreneurship and is a key concept in Keller's book, "The One Thing."

01:15:00
In this section, Gary Keller discusses the importance of focusing on the one most important thing at any given time. It is about being present in the moment and doing what matters most, which can expand and leverage one's life. The focusing question is "what's the one thing I could do such that by doing it, everything else would be easier or unnecessary?" Keller stresses that we should prioritize the appropriate steps to ensure we achieve our goals and get extraordinary results. Implementing this concept is easy as we can ask ourselves the question while pulling into the garage, waking up, or before we start the day.

01:20:00
In this section, Gary Keller discusses how the question "what's the one thing I can do such that by doing it everything else would be easier or unnecessary?" can apply in various aspects of life such as handling household chores, spending time with loved ones, and even making dietary choices. He also highlights how this question can be used in a business context, specifically when hiring someone or building a tech product. Finally, Keller emphasizes the importance of avoiding cool, easy-to-commit opportunities that may actually be threats and temptations to achieving the one thing that truly matters.

01:25:00
In this section, author and entrepreneur Gary Keller emphasizes the importance of the "one thing," which is essentially the 80/20 principle on steroids. He stresses the need to live in the moment and prioritize the most important thing in order to be successful, while also protecting oneself from distractions. He advocates for a set morning routine to prioritize personal life and health, and focusing on work during the day. However, he also recognizes the importance of being spontaneous and pursuing trivial pursuits after finishing the most important thing. Keller lists spiritual, physical, mental, and key relationships as the most important things in his life, which he prioritizes in the morning routine. He emphasizes the need to avoid having regrets in life and to prioritize the "glass ball" categories such as family, health, friends, and integrity, as opposed to the "rubber ball" of work that can bounce back if dropped.

01:30:00
In this section, Gary Keller, author of the book "The One Thing," describes how he used the question "What's the one thing I can do?" to lead a better relationship with his mother. Keller's mother had a tendency to go off on tangents that could be hurtful or harmful to him, so he asked himself what's the one thing he could do that his mother would love and keep her preoccupied. The answer was to play dominoes with his mother every week. By doing so, he discovered that it not only kept his mother happy, but it also kept her focused on trying to beat him, rather than talking negatively. Then, he asked himself the same question to find out what else he could do for his mother.

01:35:00
In this section, Gary Keller is asked about finding the one person to follow for optimum health. He states that following too many people will lead to confusion and advises to find the person who exemplifies what you want to achieve the best and make them your TrueNorth. Gary suggests following Jack LaLanne, who aimed to live to 100 years and lived up to 96. He also talks about how making categorical decisions, like saying no to certain commitments, can reduce stress and improve productivity. He shares his personal experience with speaking engagements and how setting strict policies helped him avoid negotiating one-off deals constantly.

01:40:00
In this section, Gary Keller shares a simple but profound rule that he follows when it comes to negotiating his fees. He always charges his full list price or does unpaid work for groups and causes he cares about. He never negotiates and if someone pays him an absurdly high rate, that becomes his new high-water mark. This has removed a big energy drain for him and allows him to make more rules like that to cut out distractions and focus on his core priorities. Keller is a self-proclaimed "no person" and will decline anything that hinders his path or relationships. He conveys this message to others by directly and honestly explaining that he does not have the time to say yes to everyone and thus has to say no to everybody.

01:45:00
In this section, Gary Keller reveals his time management strategy of planning his time years in advance, allowing him to have an excuse to decline invitations to events and awards shows. He suggests using a proxy to attend the event in your stead and give a speech about you, without looking like you're bragging about yourself. He also shares his answer to the Billboard question, stating that thinking big and aiming high is important because it leads to the development of big, scalable habits, whereas thinking small leads to average or below average habits that are hard to break.

01:50:00
In this section, Gary Keller emphasizes the importance of thinking big and aiming high, and then identifying the one habit needed to get there. He suggests that one's environment needs to support the goal and finding people that will cheer for and support the goal makes it easier to develop the habit. Keller also mentions the habit hack of forming a habit, which becomes a superpower, and the necessity to develop the ability to identify the singular habit needed to achieve a goal. He underscores the need to choose the direction of life to avoid ending up in places one did not want to be.

01:55:00
In this section of the video, host Tim Ferriss asks Gary Keller why he agreed to do the podcast, noting that he rarely does media. Keller explains that he respects Ferriss and believes everyone should read his first book. He also says that he enjoys talking with Ferriss and hopes to do so again. The two briefly discuss Keller's new podcast, Think Like a CEO, and Ferriss offers to link it in the show notes. The episode is sponsored by Ring, a doorbell service that allows users to see and speak to visitors from their phone.

02:00:00
