Dr. Peter Attia explained in the video "Why Dr. Peter Attia Changed His Mind About Saunas | The Tim Ferriss Show" that his support for saunas as a means of promoting overall health and longevity was due to non-randomized studies out of Finland that have shown significant reductions in all-cause mortality by sauna usage. The recommended dosage is four sessions of 20 minutes at 80 degrees Celsius in a dry sauna, and the mechanism of action is likely a combination of factors such as heat shock proteins, nitric oxide, and vascular tone reduction. Although contraindicated for some individuals, Dr. Attia overall considers saunas a promising avenue for preventative health measures.
