Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=c7ybSEYSxC0

On The Tim Ferriss Show, Tim Ferriss and Dr. Peter Attia, who focuses on longevity and performance, discuss the Centenarian Olympics, which attains the goal of being physically capable and active for the first 100 years of a person's life. Attia frames centenarian training around stability, strength, aerobic efficiency, and anaerobic performance. They also discuss the importance of proper form and technique in exercises such as squatting and deadlifting, spinal traction, and generating concentric intra-abdominal pressure. Attia's change of mind on the use of metformin, a drug currently popular in discussions of age- and cancer-mitigating, is also discussed. Ferriss and Attia end their episode discussing the importance and difficulty in dosing the potency of fasting properly and the idea of personal narratives and how they can be changed with work.
Dr. Peter Attia, MD, discusses his passion for archery and the emotional skills it has taught him, including distancing himself from negative thoughts and changing his relationship with food. He also delves into the specifics of using a compound bow, including the importance of back tension and the surprise release. Attia talks about the impact of childhood experiences on a person's personality, specifically his own issues with anger and finding the right therapist to manage it. He also touches on the topic of legal performance-enhancing drugs in sports, including growth hormone and psilocybin. Additionally, he speaks about the benefits of exercise and how it changed his mind on its significance, favoring a portfolio approach that includes cardio, strength training, and proper nutrition, sleep, and nutrient cycling.
Dr. Peter Attia talks about his methods for improving sleep quality, which require changes in behavior and prioritizing sleep. He suggests using blue light blocking glasses, avoiding electronics in the evening, being consistent with bedtime and wake-up times, understanding one's chronotype, and ensuring a dark room or using eye shades. Dr. Attia recommends eliminating alcohol and using a cooler pad to improve sleep quality, and warns against consuming liquid sugar and combining alcohol with sugar. Tim Ferriss and Dr. Attia discuss various unrelated topics, such as male stupidity and podcasting techniques. Lastly, they discuss Dr. Attia's preparation tips for podcast interviews and his podcast called "The Drive." Tim Ferriss promotes his Five-Bullet Friday email newsletter and sponsors Peloton and BeetElite, while Dr. Attia talks about the benefits and cautionary measures of using BeetElite as a workout supplement.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
In this section, Tim Ferriss promotes two of his sponsors, Beat Elite and Peloton. Beat Elite is marketed as an endurance superfood that enhances workout performance and recovery times. Ferriss uses Beat Elite before his endurance workouts, which he claims allows for a 10-20% increase in workout performance, especially for high-intensity interval training. Peloton, on the other hand, is a cutting-edge indoor cycling bike that brings live studio classes right to your home. Ferriss uses Peloton for high-intensity interval training in the morning, typically riding for a short 20 minutes to kickstart his day. He describes the instructors as amazing with personalities and styles to match the rider's mood.

00:05:00
In this section, Tim Ferriss introduces Dr. Peter Attia and their plan for his episode, which will be categorized into "five things" including five things Attia is currently excited about, five things he has changed his mind on in the past few years, and five absurd or stupid things he still does. Attia is known for his expertise in extending one's health and lifespan, with a focus on longevity and performance across different dimensions. Ferriss and Attia also joke about Atta's particular and obsessive behavior towards stapling.

00:10:00
In this section, Dr. Peter Attia discusses his concept of the "centenarian Olympics," where he aims to train individuals to remain physically capable and active as they reach 100 years old. Attia describes how his own realization came at a funeral where he noticed that the last 10 years of his friend's parent's life were plagued with injuries that prevented them from engaging in the activities they loved. Attia argues that there needs to be more focus on training to be "kick-ass 90 year olds" to ensure that cognitive and physical as an exoskeleton death does not affect an individual's quality of life before their actual death. He details different tests, like being able to get up off the floor or to be able to stop a running toddler, that can help identify structural misgivings that limit an individual's mobility later in life.

00:15:00
In this section, Dr. Peter Attia discusses his idea of the Centenarian Olympics, a set of 18 physical tasks that he wants to be able to do when he reaches the age of 90, such as a 30-pound goblet squat, walking up three flights of stairs carrying groceries and pulling himself out of a pool. He identifies stability, strength, aerobic efficiency, and anaerobic performance as the crucial four elements of health, which require a specific set of movements and biomechanical techniques. Attia argues that people need to develop a real sense of purpose around exercise and can work backward to build towards it. The goal is to understand how one should do each movement pattern at our age to ensure that we can safely do it when we reach our nineties, which requires complete stabilization of the upper and lower body.

00:20:00
In this section, Dr. Peter Attia discusses the importance of proper form and technique when exercising, specifically in relation to squatting and deadlifting. He emphasizes the importance of spinal traction and generating concentric intra-abdominal pressure from diaphragm to pelvis to stretch out the spine while under load. This is crucial for being able to squat safely and stabilize the trunk, which is the rate-limiting step for a squat. Attia also notes the importance of checking one's ego in the weight room and checking movement defects, even if it means starting from scratch with very light weights.

00:25:00
In this section, Dr. Peter Attia discusses the importance of generating intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) in stabilizing the spine and enabling better athletic performance through exercises such as deadlifts and squats. He explains the concept of IAP as the uniform force generated by putting pressure in the abdomen, preferably without inflating the pelvis. Additionally, Dr. Attia talks about his change of mind on the use of metformin, which he used to believe was a low-risk age- and cancer-mitigating drug specifically for diabetic patients. However, studies show that metformin's mitochondrial toxin properties activate an enzyme that can mimic a fasted state for healthy individuals, leading to numerous benefits. Metformin is also becoming increasingly popular as a topic of discussion in the last 5 years.

00:30:00
In this section, Dr. Peter Attia discusses his use of metformin and how his view on the drug has changed over time. He explains how a type of exercise called Zone 2 training, which improves mitochondrial performance and efficiency, showed him that metformin actually impairs his exercise output. While metformin has been largely helpful for people with diabetes whose mitochondria are not functioning well, it may not be as beneficial for those without the disease. Recent studies have shown that metformin inhibits the inflammatory response that promotes muscle adaptation, but the jury is still out on the overall effects of the drug. Overall, Dr. Attia believes that focusing on exercise has brought him more benefits than taking metformin.

00:35:00
In this section, Dr. Peter Attia and Tim Ferriss discuss the use of metformin and whether it's necessary to use it selectively, such as only using it in the evening when someone is fed and not using it in the morning when someone exercises. Dr. Attia believes that if it's possible to treat patients without medication, one should always try to do that, though metformin does offer a great step forward in certain circumstances. However, the ability to reverse health issues like sleep deprivation, lack of exercise, and poor glucose disposal via fasting, exercise, and sleep is more powerful than all drugs combined. Additionally, they briefly touch on Attia's obsession with a game/sport called egg boxing, where competitors bang eggs against each other until one cracks, and how seriously he takes it, even guarding his championship title closely.

00:40:00
In this section, Tim Ferriss and Dr. Peter Attia discuss the potency of fasting and the difficulty in dosing it properly. Dr. Attia explains that while fasting is a potent tool, it's odd that we don't know how to dose it properly. He fasts for about seven days every quarter, but the question remains - how do we know if fasting for three days per month would produce the same optimal physiologic response that could lead to life extension and a reduction of disease risk? Dr. Attia proposes forming a coalition to put a pot of money together and find the best people who can help pick the right animal model to study the effects of fasting in order to achieve a better understanding of how to dose it properly.

00:45:00
In this section, Dr. Peter Attia discusses the difficulty of studying fasting in animal models. Although mice have the advantage of being easy to study, a linear extrapolation from humans would not be applicable due to significant differences. Additionally, the lack of interest from traditional funding vehicles, such as NIH and industry, necessitates philanthropy funding. Dr. Attia proposes a study design involving three arms: one with regular mouse chow, one with intermittent fasting of varying lengths, and one with a mega-fast per year. The primary outcome measure would be lifespan, but biomarker data would also be of interest. Finally, Dr. Attia discusses his current fasting regimen, which involves a flexible schedule and leading into the fast with lower calories and carbohydrates.

00:50:00
In this section, Dr. Peter Attia discusses his own personal fasting routine, which includes a week of keto followed by a week of water-only fasting, bookended by another week of keto. He talks about potentially changing this routine to three days per month, which would be less socially intrusive and potentially easier for him to handle. He also goes into detail about his supplement routine during his water-only fast, which includes sodium and magnesium supplements. Additionally, Dr. Attia discusses how he has changed his mind about believing that personalities are set in stone and are not subject to change, as he has personally worked on overcoming his own anger issues through self-reflection and therapy.

00:55:00
In this section, Tim Ferriss and Dr. Peter Attia discuss the idea of personal narratives and how they can become deeply ingrained in our sense of self. Dr. Attia shares a personal example of believing that he was naturally angry and volatile, but has since realized that this narrative is incorrect and can be changed with work. The conversation then shifts to the importance of examining our weaknesses and flaws as coping mechanisms that served an important function at some point in our lives. By reframing them in this way, we can approach them with empathy and work towards changing them.

01:00:00
In this section of the video, Peter Attia discusses the importance of recognizing our past adaptations and how they have shaped us. He references an interview with Terrence Real where he explains it as acknowledging and thanking our adaptive child but then moving them to the back seat and letting the adult drive. The conversation then shifts to a somewhat comical topic of tearing phone books. Attia explains his fascination with this skill and how it became pathological to the point where he even added the size of the phone book in a city to his criteria for choosing a medical school. The sweet spot for him was three inches and anything bigger was simply too big for his hands.

01:05:00
In this section, the speaker tells a funny story about a time when he went on a date with his future wife and showed off his talent for tearing phone books. He talks about his past obsession with tearing phone books and how he is not as good at it now, but still enjoys doing it now and then. The discussion then shifts to archery hunting, a hobby that the host introduced the speaker to, and the speaker credits the host for this new interest in hunting. He also talks about the methodical and meticulous nature of archery hunting and how it brings in elements of mathematics and physics, which he has a background in.

01:10:00
In this section, Peter Attia talks about his passion for archery and how it has become an integral part of his daily routine. He describes how archery has taught him important emotional skills, including distancing himself from negative thoughts, and how it has changed his relationship with food. He also discusses the exciting experience of hunting and harvesting animals, and his aspiration to only eat food that he has killed by next year. Overall, Attia highlights the many benefits of archery, both physical and mental, and how it has enriched his life.

01:15:00
In this section, Dr. Peter Attia speaks with Tim Ferriss&nbsp;about his passion for archery, how it has become a fast and effective assessment tool for him, and his love for using the Hoyt rx-3 bow. He emphasizes the significance of back tension in archery and the importance of a surprise release, as it enhances the accuracy and combats trigger anxiety. Furthermore, he goes on to discuss the specifics of using a compound bow, including the two holes to align and the multiple pins in the bow.

01:20:00
In this section, Dr. Peter Attia discusses how childhood experiences can shape a personâ€™s personality and have significant impacts on their lives. He explains how trauma can lead to feelings of helplessness and be perceived as such by a child, which can shape their subsequent behaviors. He also discusses how he has seen this in his patients who lost parents when they were very young and how it can result in chaos and significantly mold the rest of their lives. Dr. Attia then relates this to his own experiences of being angry in front of his children, realizing that although he never got angry at his kids, they saw him angry and how this realization led him to make significant changes in his behavior.

01:25:00
In this section of the video, Dr. Peter Attia talks about the impact of his anger on his daughter and how kids internalize everything they experience, whether major or minor. He suggests that there is still shrapnel that can hit them in a way that it wouldn't hit an adult, but adds that some good things can come from hard experiences, so it's important to accept the positives that come from these things without ignoring the things that need to be mended or repaired. To defuse the default anger response, Dr. Attia recommends several things, including meditation, which has made a big difference but only creates a pause between the stimulus and the response.

01:30:00
In this section, Dr. Peter Attia, MD talks about how he had to learn a new vocabulary to understand emotions and examine what anger stems from. He explains that he felt inadequate as he failed to protect his family and his chickens, and that he wished he could have consoled his daughter instead of raging his anger. Dr. Attia also talks about traditional insight related therapy, where Esther Perel played an important role in his life. Through therapy, Dr. Attia learned how to recognize his emotions and understand what is underlying them, which helped him to manage his anger better.

01:35:00
In this section, Peter Attia discusses his personal issues with anger and how he has been working to manage it. He mentions using tools such as Ryan Holiday's course on anger and David Foster Wallace's relational reframing strategies. Additionally, he emphasizes the importance of finding the right therapist, specifically one that he can connect with and whose insights result in a "phenotypic benefit" and reduced suffering for him. Attia also explains that for him, it's important to focus on results and whether the therapy is reducing his suffering rather than an abstract notion of happiness.

01:40:00
In this section, Dr. Peter Attia discusses the importance of therapists who aren't afraid to tell you when you're wrong and provide honest feedback, even if it's unpleasant. He explains that he has multiple therapists who know one another, and the brutal honesty he receives from them has been effective in solving his issues. Dr. Attia also shares a game he plays with his wife called "Forks and Knives," in which he counts the utensils they put in the dishwasher as a child and continues to play to this day. This game has evolved over the years, and now Dr. Attia includes other utensils as proxies for spoons to level the playing field.

01:45:00
In this section, Tim Ferriss talks with Dr. Peter Attia about sports and doping. They mention xenon gas, a legal performance-enhancing drug that was used in the Sochi Olympics by endurance athletes. Tim asks Dr. Attia if there are currently any legal performance-enhancing drugs that the anti-doping committees have not yet caught up to, and Dr. Attia mentions growth hormone being difficult to test for and psilocybin being an interesting one that is not banned by WADA. They also talk about MDMA, which is banned by WADA, but Dr. Attia can't think of any sport that actually gets better with MDMA.

01:50:00
In this section, Dr. Peter Attia and Tim Ferriss discuss using microdoses of psychedelics to enhance athletic performance, specifically mentioning low doses of psilocybin for physical performance and LSD for endurance athletes. They then delve into Attia's passion for race car driving, which he enjoys for its mental benefits in teaching how to cope with mistakes and move on quickly, as well as the physical and mechanical challenges involved. Ferriss questions whether Attia has considered finding a group or partner activity to pursue, given the solitary nature of his interests.

01:55:00
In this section, Dr. Peter Attia discusses the benefits of exercise and how it changed his mind regarding its significance. Although he was a borderline exercise addict, he did not fully appreciate the metabolic benefits of regular workouts. When his analyst determined that exercise is the most potent tool to prevent or delay Alzheimer's disease, he was initially skeptical. However, after examining exercise's impact on vascular and growth factor changes and neurotropic factors, he became a firm believer in it. The literature is not entirely clear about type and dose, but he favors a portfolio approach to achieve balance between modest or low-intensity cardio, high-intensity cardio, and strength training, each of which increases BDNF to varying degrees. He also emphasizes the importance of getting proper nutrition, sleep, and nutrient cycling to reap the benefits of exercise.

02:00:00
In this section, Dr. Peter Attia discusses his approach to improving sleep quality without necessarily relying on chemicals to patients. He mentions that a patient has to change some behaviors and prioritize sleep, as it is not more of spending eight hours lying on a bed. Dr. Attia goes ahead to list some of the behaviors that he uses and how he attentively keeps track. These include using the right blue light blocking glasses, avoiding electronics in the evening, being consistent in bedtime and wake-up time, understanding own chronotype, ensuring there is incredible darkness in the actual room at night or using eye shades. He also almost eliminates alcohol and uses a cooler pad to improve sleep quality, he recommends this to people who have insomnia issues to consider some of his approaches to improve their sleep quality.

02:05:00
In this section, Dr. Peter Attia discusses how alcohol can disrupt sleep, reducing REM sleep, slightly reducing deep sleep and increasing fragmentation leading to moving into stage one and stage two more often. He also describes an increase in resting heart rate, lower heart rate variability, and higher body temperature. He mentions that it's important to be mindful of your drinking habits and to make it worthwhile when you do choose to drink. He advises against combining sugar and alcohol as it can severely impact your liver. Dr. Attia also mentions that liquid sugar can cause more harm than solid sugar, and that the dose and type of drink can have different effects on each person.

02:10:00
This excerpt contains a variety of items that are not related to each other, ranging from the effect of sugar on the gastrointestinal tract to the "What If" game that the interviewee enjoys playing with his wife. He shares examples of the game, in which he asks if his wife would still like him if he did various bizarre things such as using his toenails to cut vegetables, wearing a bright red Speedo, or watching the Smurfs for two hours every day. His wife often provides a humorous rationale for vetoing these scenarios, but the interviewee seems to enjoy the game thoroughly.

02:15:00
In this section, Tim Ferriss and guest Dr. Peter Attia share some stories about male stupidity and the dangers of taking dares for money or challenging feats. Tim shares a story about how, in a steakhouse, Kevin Rose offered a measly $20 for Tim to drink an entire bottle of hot sauce, which he objected to and countered with a challenge to eat a whole lobster for $10,000, which Kevin attempted but ultimately failed. They both reflect on the apparent fact that this sort of behavior is more common among males than females and joke about the possibility that male stupidity could have led to the extinction of our species were it not for modern medicine.

02:20:00
In this section, Tim Ferriss and Dr. Peter Attia discuss the craft of podcasting, including interviewing techniques and self-critique. Ferriss mentions that listening to his own podcasts has been a valuable tool for him to learn and improve. The two reflect on the importance of being engaged in the conversation while also maintaining a sense of direction and the ability to flag important points. Ferriss also notes that the cognitive skills developed in podcasting may have wider applicability in other areas.

02:25:00
In this excerpt, Tim Ferriss discusses his early struggles with interviewing and how he overcame them with practice and asking for advice from more experienced interviewers like Katie Couric. He touches upon the importance of preparation, avoiding talking over the person being interviewed, and the various styles of interviewing, from James Lipton's scripted approach to Larry King's more spontaneous one. Ferriss emphasizes the learning curve of becoming a skilled interviewer and the importance of not missing an opportunity to take the discussion in another direction by being unprepared.

02:30:00
In this section, Dr. Peter Attia discusses his approach to preparing for interviews. While he doesn't go in with set questions, he spends a lot of time prepping by having his team provide him with a dossier on the subject matter. For a recent interview, he had 28 pages of notes covering everything related to THC and CBD. Despite the preparation, Attia admits to struggling with a fixation on remembering everything and sometimes missing important details. He hopes to continue to cultivate his skills to hone his craft and develop his own unique voice.

02:35:00
In this section, Tim Ferriss and Peter Attia discuss the process of preparing for podcast interviews. Attia recommends pre-recording the initial episodes and using Skype or Zen caster to take notes as a structural prep. He finds it helpful to segment episodes into 30-minute sections but avoids fixating on specific questions. Instead, he focuses on starting with a handful of questions, knowing where to end with bookend questions, and looking for side streets in between. Attia's podcast, "The Drive," covers a range of topics and can be found on his website or through a search for his name. He recommends the "Studying Studies" blog series for those looking to explore his thinking in written form.

02:40:00
This section of the transcript is not related to the interview but rather the host promoting his Five-Bullet Friday email newsletter and two of his sponsors, Peloton and BeetElite. The Five-Bullet Friday email is a short email where the host shares cool things he's found over the week. Meanwhile, Peloton is an indoor cycling bike that provides live studio classes, and BeetElite is a product that's recommended to improve endurance during workouts.

02:45:00
In this section, the speaker discusses Beat Elite, a concentrated nitric oxide supplement that can improve workout performance by 10-20%. The supplement is easier to consume than its equivalent in beets, as it is rapidly assimilated and tastes good. However, the mixture can stain clothing and bedding, so caution is advised. Beat Elite is trusted by hundreds of elite teams and athletes worldwide and is certified by an informed sport. The company offers a 20% discount to Tim Ferriss's listeners and encourages them to try it out.
