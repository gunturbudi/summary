The video discusses the relationships between Alzheimer's disease and sleep. According to the video, individuals who report sleeping six or less hours across their lifespan have a significantly higher risk of developing high amounts of beta amyloid and Tau protein in the brain. This was found to be causally related to sleep deprivation, which can be reversed by providing individuals with a full night of sleep. Finally, the video discusses the research of Macon Nedergaard, who discovered that the brain has a cleansing system that removes harmful substances.

Dr. Matthew Walker discusses the relationship between Alzheimer's disease and sleep. He explains that sleep is a cleansing mechanism for the brain, and that Alzheimer's disease develops when proteins build up in the brain unbalancedly. He goes on to say that the regions of the brain that are most affected by Alzheimer's disease are also the regions that generate deep non-REM sleep. The deep sleep-generating center in the frontal lobe is dominant in those with Alzheimer's disease. Finally, he explains that one way to reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease is to get enough sleep each night.

The video demonstrates how sleep deprivation is associated with an increase in the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, and suggests that sleep might be a modifiable factor that could be used to prevent or slow the progression of the disease.
