Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
In this section of the interview, Morgan Housel discusses the comparison between Warren Buffet and Jim Simons, two of the most successful investors of all time. While Buffet is the wealthiest investor and has been investing for 80 years, Jim Simons has the greatest long-term average annual returns of 66% versus Buffet's 21%. However, Housel notes that the goal of maximizing one's accumulated wealth is not necessarily achieved by just earning the highest returns but by earning the best returns for the longest period of time, which is usually not the highest returns available.

00:05:00
In this section, Morgan Housel explains that the power of compounding is essentially maximizing returns with time as the exponent. He describes Warren Buffett as the greatest investor of all time because of his endurance and longevity. Housel goes on to explain that 99% of Buffett's wealth was accumulated after his 50th birthday, and 97% came after his 65th birthday. He also notes that people tend to misunderstand the amount of time it takes for compounding to work, and how it can turn into something incredible after decades of investing. Finally, Housel touches on how people over-interpret and misinterpret Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger.

00:10:00
In this section, Morgan Housel discusses the common misconception that investing like Warren Buffett is simple. People tend to oversimplify what Buffett does, thinking they can pick a good business and read a balance sheet just like him. However, there is so much nuance and gut feeling that has accumulated over Buffett's 80 years of experience, making value investing more complex than it sounds. Also, Berkshire Hathaway is now a very large company, and the odds that they will achieve market-beating returns in any significant way are slim. Housel also discusses how the size of companies, funds, or banks becomes one of the main parameters for picking, and how there is a sweet spot in evolution, where big helps but only to a certain point.

00:15:00
In this section, the speaker discusses a product on Citigroup's balance sheet called a CDO putback that Robert Rubin, a former Treasury Secretary and a partner at Goldman Sachs who sat on the Citigroup board of directors at the time, had never heard of before even though it had the potential to bankrupt the entire company. The speaker empathizes with the "too big to fail" bankers and argues that Citigroup and other large banks are just too big to manage, with too many things going on for any sane person to understand. The conversation then shifts to the speaker's financial advice for his son, which includes a piece about how the man-in-the-car paradox shows that people think about themselves way more than they think about other people and are imagining themselves as the driver of the fancy car, rather than admiring the actual driver. The speaker also adds that as a parent, he has learned the power of having kids and how it has influenced his perspective on what is important in life.

00:20:00
In this section, Morgan Housel talks about the unpredictability of future personalities and aspirations in children and how parents cannot give universal financial advice based on their own assumptions about what their children might become. Instead, he mentions the importance of cultivating traits of independence and autonomy in children from a young age as this is a universal desire among people. Housel believes that many people undervalue money's power to buy independence and autonomy, which becomes crucial, especially during fluctuations such as job loss or financial crises. Despite the immediate satisfaction that comes from buying goods or objects, people should focus more on building wealth that they have not spent, which can offer them financial freedom to make their own choices.

00:25:00
In this section, Morgan Housel shares the story of his parents, who met at a hippie commune and became an ER doctor and nurse, respectively. They had a very high savings rate and lived below their means when they were undergraduates, despite having three children. When Housel's father became burned out after working for 20 to 25 years, he was able to retire on his own terms since he had a high savings rate. This gave him independence, autonomy, and happiness, which exceeds that offered by material possessions. Housel observed that people who are frugal for a very long time sometimes find it difficult to spend money on themselves.

00:30:00
In this section, Morgan Housel discusses his parents' post-retirement experience and how they have found happiness with their small-time farm on the coast of northern California. Housel's father, who was a doctor, went from professional to a full-fledged hippie and it all came back full circle. Housel then talks about his own career path, from starting as a greeter at Denny's to working in investment banking and private equity before ending up as a writer. He wrote for Motley Fool after a conversation with a friend and ended up sticking with it, authoring over 3,000 articles.

00:35:00
In this section, Morgan Housel discusses how he became a writer and his switch from wanting to work in investment banking or private equity to becoming a writer at the Motley Fool out of desperation for a paycheck. He initially struggled with no writing background and had to hack his way through the first five to seven years before he felt like he was hitting his stride and cracking the formula on what works in a finance article. Housel also talks about joining Collaborative Fund, a venture capital firm, after a chance meeting with Craig Shapiro, the founder of the firm, and how Housel was initially hesitant to join. He eventually saw Shapiro's vision and joined the firm as a writer.

00:40:00
In this section, Morgan Housel, a writer and speaker for Collaborative Fund, discusses the purpose of having a writer like him at a venture capital firm. He explains that money is fungible, so venture capitalists need to stand apart in the private investing world by having values that matter and a view of the world that is differentiated. The values and the view do not matter unless people know about them, so he is tasked with going out there and showing how he thinks, what he thinks, and who he is by writing about interesting and thought-stimulating subjects that people can share with others, making personal branding the right way to go in content these days.

00:45:00
In this section, Morgan Housel shares the story of joining Markel Corporation's board of directors. Markel is an insurance company similar to Berkshire Hathaway that uses insurance proceeds to purchase whole industrial businesses that it plans on holding forever. Joining the Markel board was an obvious answer for Housel, as he admired the company for a long period of time. While it is not a small board, Housel believes some misconceptions exist about what board members do, which is not running or micro-managing the company but being an overseer and hiring, firing, and paying the CEO.

00:50:00
In this section, the speaker talks about their experience being appointed to a board and the burden of responsibility that accompanies such a role. The speaker also discusses the importance of having a generational diversity on boards and how different individuals have different risk tolerances and time horizons which shapes their definition of risk. They give an example of how the definition of inflation being transitory varies from person to person and how that relates to understanding risk in investing. The speaker emphasizes that most investing debates are not actually debates but rather differences in risk preferences and goals.

00:55:00
In this section, Morgan Housel discusses the concept of choosing the right game to play in different contexts, such as in investing, where risk is a personalized calculation for each individual. He also talks about the importance of being selfish when creating content, focusing on what he personally finds interesting rather than trying to cater to an audience. Housel mentions several people he admires for their restraint and thoughtfulness on Twitter, including James Clear, Mark Manson, naval, and Derek Thompson. He believes that they have all played the game of Twitter well, producing thought-provoking content that is worth reading every time.

01:00:00
In this section, Morgan Housel discusses investors he admires but would never try to emulate, including Warren Buffet and Benjamin Graham. Housel believes that admirable investors have unique skills that most people lack, and that their success may not necessarily translate to modern times. He does mention John Bogle, who he believes to be the most admirable due to his selfless approach to Vanguard, which is owned by the people who own the mutual and ETF funds, and not by shareholders or profits. Housel also mentions James Simons and Renaissance Technology, whose consistency and results set them apart from everyone else. Additionally, Housel praises investors Monish Pabrai and Brent Beshore for their successful investing, but more so for their kind and admirable personalities.

01:05:00
In this section, the speakers discuss the human side of successful investors such as Warren Buffett and Jim Simon. They imply that while their success is admirable, there are significant costs associated with it that many people don't see. The transcript cites examples of Buffett's singular devotion to picking the best stocks as having come at the expense of his family life. On the other hand, Tim Ferris was candid regarding his shortcomings relative to Warren Buffet, explaining that the latter's unique hardwiring made it possible for him to have an unparalleled ability to pick stocks. Tim stated that personal investment mistakes he has made in the past have almost always stemmed from selling too soon, highlighting the importance of understanding long term investment goals.

01:10:00
n this section, the discussion turns to Warren Buffett's actions during the COVID-19 pandemic, where he sold his entire portfolio of airline stocks at a loss. While Buffett's decision could be seen as the right thing to do given the potential catastrophic wipeout due to the pandemic, it shows that even someone with 80 years of experience can panic and not buy anything when the world is falling apart. Furthermore, the discussion highlights that Buffett has not put a lot of capital to work during market declines, and his investment style has evolved over time, where the idea of buying when there's blood in the streets has less relevance today than it did 50 years ago. The discussion ends with a personal story illustrating how easy it is to respond to risk in ways that you never thought you would.

01:15:00
In this section, the speaker talks about the difficulty of investing during a panic or economic downturn. People might think they can remain calm and take advantage of buying opportunities during a hypothetical market downturn, but in reality, a real downturn is much more complicated and stressful, and it can be challenging to make the right decisions. He also discusses Benjamin Graham's investment strategy, and how much of his success came from investing heavily in Geico, which broke all the rules Graham laid out in his "Intelligent Investor" book. This explains that success comes from just a few home runs, and even for the most successful investors, their majority of investments do not succeed.

01:20:00
In this section of the transcript, Tim and Morgan discuss the disproportionate, asymmetric reward and punishment of tail risks or asymmetric returns. They use the example of Walt Disney, who had a string of commercial failures before the mega success of Snow White, which kept the studio afloat. They also talk about the time horizon as a driver of success in investing, and how seeking longevity and being paranoid of going out of business has kept Sequoia successful for over 40 years. Emulating luck and talent of successful people may not be possible, but there are certain principles that can be emulated to have a chance at achieving success.

01:25:00
In this section, Morgan Housel discusses the behavior of successful investors, highlighting how despite multi-billionaire investors' immense success in their industry, they are still plagued with paranoia and fear. He also emphasizes the value of not blindly copying others in the industry like Warren Buffet but instead looking at one's own life goals to determine what portions of the investor's practices can align with one's life. Additionally, he discusses how it is difficult to distinguish fact from fiction and signal from noise when investing, so it is essential to parse the difference between what works on a chalkboard and what works in the real world.

01:30:00
In this section, Morgan Housel discusses the difference between being reasonable and being rational. While investing in stocks of companies close to one's house may not be rational, it is a very reasonable thing to do as familiarity can make it easier to invest one's life savings. Housel also talks about how financial decisions are not just about spreadsheets and the rational world but also about the real world and how people's brains work, and how things actually play out. He shares his own story about why his worst financial decision of not having a mortgage has been the best money decision for him and his wife, giving them a sense of independence and security. Housel also talks about the contrast in investing styles between a janitor who put every spare penny into stocks and a technology multi-millionaire who handed a hotel valet thousands of dollars in cash to buy gold coins.

01:35:00
In this section, Morgan Housel shares a story about a wealthy man who would carry around stacks of hundred-dollar bills and randomly give out money to strangers just for the fun of it. This man also threw gold coins worth about a thousand dollars apiece into the Pacific Ocean like flat rocks for entertainment purposes. While this behavior may seem fun and exciting, it is important to remember that slow and steady wins the race, and substance over smoke is essential for building long-term wealth. It is also important to find a balance between saving for the future and enjoying life in the present. The skills needed for financial success do not necessarily come from traditional sources like Ivy League education or high-powered careers, as exemplified by the story of a janitor who built wealth through consistent saving and investing.

01:40:00
In this section, Morgan Housel discusses the importance of leaving enough money for children to do anything, but not so much that they can do nothing. He mentions a quote from Warren Buffet, in which he states his desire to leave enough money for his children to have a safety net, but not enough to become a fuel. Housel emphasizes the importance of allowing children to become their own person, pursue their own interests, and have their own personality, which was not the case for the unhappy heirs of the Vanderbilt fortune. He discusses his own struggle with the parental instinct to become "a fuel" for his children, stating that becoming a safety net, but never a fuel, is tough but necessary. He also highlights the danger of leaving the bar too high for children who go into a different career that does not pay as well. Finally, he touches on the many homes notoriously built by the Vanderbilts, particularly the absurd Bill Moore home that William George Vanderbilt hardly ever visited.

01:45:00
In this section, the interviewee recommends a diary called "A Great Depression: A Diary" by Benjamin Roth, which details daily life during the great depression of the 1930s. He describes it as unintentionally becoming the best economics book ever written because there is no hindsight bias, and Roth wrote in real-time about what was happening in the economy without having knowledge of how the story ends. The interviewee raves about the fascinating insights into the time period and points out that the psychology of people's reactions to the Depression is similar to what happened in 2008. The interviewee also praises historian Frederick Lewis Allen's work for focusing on the lives of ordinary people instead of just the big figures and events.

01:50:00
In this section, financial writer Morgan Housel discusses how historical events that seem obvious in hindsight were not predicted by anyone at the time. He also notes the danger in only looking at averages and ignoring volatility, as well as the importance of having a conservative asset allocation to prepare for unexpected risks. Financial advisors such as Carl Richards have emphasized that risk is what remains after planning, meaning that those who only plan for what they can imagine are likely to miss the biggest risks. Housel suggests that having an extra level of savings and conservatism is necessary to avoid panicking during difficult times and making poor financial decisions.

01:55:00
In this section, Morgan Housel talks about the importance of being prepared for risks that you cannot envision, and not just for risks that you can imagine. He shares that many investors are not conservative enough, and that once per decade, there is a surprise event that catches people off guard. He recommends being prepared for such events by having extra savings. Housel also discusses his process for reading books, which includes using both the Kindle and Audible versions, highlighting sections, and sharing his highlights with friends. He shares a highlighted section that emphasizes the importance of having a cash reserve, and talks about his own experience of being conservative with his investments after experiencing losses in 2007-2008.

02:00:00
In this section, Morgan Housel discusses the importance of having a personal benchmark for success in financial matters. He stresses the need to detach from other people's benchmarks and judge everything by whether you're happy and fulfilled. He shared an anecdote about how a client's sole benchmark was having enough money to travel with his wife, and that no portfolio returns or benchmarks mattered to him. Morgan talks about how goalposts for success in money and investing can be hard to establish since they tend to move. He shared his personal vision for success, which includes independence, autonomy, and spending time with his kids. Morgan stresses the importance of realizing that no one cares about you as much as you do and advised focusing on what makes you happy instead of trying to show off to others.

02:05:00
In this section, Morgan Housel discusses how individuals can prepare themselves for a long-term and potentially bumpy road to success, whether it be in investing or their careers. He advises that individuals should view volatility and downsides as fees to be paid to achieve long-term success, rather than fines to be avoided at all costs. This mindset can help individuals avoid the urge to panic and make rash decisions. Housel stresses that life comes with costs and to achieve something worthwhile, one must be willing to pay a fee, whether it be in the form of stress and anxiety or other forms.

02:10:00
In this section, Morgan Housel discusses a hypothetical scenario in which the only way to consume news is by reading the cover of a few newspapers and following a handful of journalists and writers. Some of the writers he suggests include Nick Maggiulli, Josh Brown, Derek Thompson, Jason Zweig, and Carl Richards. While some of these writers may have a large following, Housel believes they've earned it through their merit and expertise. He also mentions well-known authors James Clear and Ryan Holiday, both of whom he thinks have earned their success with thoughtful and insightful content. Housel shares a funny story about how he originally thought the name of Clear's book, "Atomic Habits," sounded cheesy, but the book turned out to be a blockbuster success.

02:15:00
In this section, Morgan Housel shares his personal hall of fame, including a book recommendation called "The Science of Fear" by Dan Gardner. The book changed how he thinks about fear and the difference between slow, thoughtful thinking about future risks versus reacting in the heat of the moment. It also affects his planning and behavior, as he doesn't feel the pressure to become the world's greatest investor and has become introspective about his own personality and reactions to stress. When it comes to writing advice, he admits that he doesn't have a set process but emphasizes the importance of not scheduling it and letting it come naturally.

02:20:00
section of the video features Morgan Housel discussing his process as a writer. Housel emphasizes the importance of not forcing ideas and instead allowing them to come naturally, often while out walking or doing other activities. He also advises against trying to push through writer's block, suggesting that it's often a sign of a bad idea rather than a lack of productivity. Housel recommends freeing oneself from deadlines and expectations in order to write in a healthier and more productive way, and also advises saving discarded scraps of writing for inspiration in future projects. Housel uses his recent article, "How This All Happened," as an example of a project that grew from years of mulling over ideas and connections before being fully realized.

02:25:00
In this section, Morgan Housel discusses his approach to writing and how he often starts with just a single idea or nugget and explores where it takes him. He emphasizes the importance of being open to exploring and not feeling restricted by an outline, as it allows for creativity in the writing process. He also discusses the genesis of his article, "The Optimal Amount of Hassle," which was inspired by Steven Pressfield's comments on people in a mental institution who couldn't handle the hassle of life. Housel believes there is an optimal level of hassle to deal with in life and that it's an important skill to have.

02:30:00
In this section of the video, Morgan Housel discusses his experiences with education and how his focus on skiing led to a lack of conventional high school education. He explains that skiing was viewed as more important than school by many in his competitive ski racing group, and he completed an independent study program designed for delinquents to fulfill educational requirements, receiving a diploma in the mail at age 16. He went on to attend college after realizing the slim chances of becoming a professional ski racer and working as a valet at a hotel, where he saw firsthand the wealth disparity between himself and his wealthy clientele.

02:35:00
In this section, Morgan Housel shares his journey to becoming a writer and his lack of self-confidence in his writing abilities. He had very basic education on writing and struggled with grammar, but had some seed of storytelling skills that he was able to develop with the help of editors at Motley Fool. Housel also reflects on the chance encounters and serendipitous accidents in life that led him to where he is now, such as meeting and befriending a writer at Motley Fool who he initially emailed to correct a typo, ultimately leading to his career in writing.

02:40:00
In this section, the interviewer asks Morgan Housel about a list of questions he has created that are relevant to everyone, including what people believe that is actually just good marketing and what looks unsustainable but is actually a new trend. Housel discusses examples such as his own political beliefs and certain investing beliefs that may sound good but are not true. He also talks about crypto as a new trend that may seem unsustainable but has a potential for the future. Housel notes that people have a tendency to underestimate their ability to adapt and come up with new ways and technologies to create more, as seen throughout history.

02:45:00
In this section, Morgan Housel discusses the evolution of value investing and how different formulas and metrics used to determine value have changed over time. He notes that while investing in undervalued assets will always be successful, the formulas used to determine value will continue to evolve. Additionally, Housel speaks about the danger of developing a brand for oneself and the importance of being cautious about people who are compensated financially or reputationally for their position. He explains that the compensation structure can change our views and strategies towards investing. Lastly, he discusses what we might be ignoring today that will seem obvious in a year and suggests that it might be something related to Covid, such as being too scared or not scared enough, or a prediction that the 2022 election will be a disaster in one way or another.

02:50:00
In this section, Morgan Housel discusses Jason Zweig's book "Your Money and Your Brain" which was one of the first behavioral finance books that looked at how emotions dictate financial decisions. Housel then introduces a tweet by Jason Zweig about the asymmetric costs of defense and offense when it comes to drones and how drone warfare is the future of warfare. Housel expresses concern about how advancements in drone technology make it easy to start and progress a war without sacrificing soldiers' lives, which could lead to catastrophic consequences.

02:55:00
In this section of the video, Tim Ferriss and Naval Ravikant discuss the potential dangers of deepfake technology and the future of virtual reality. They predict that within the next 12 to 18 months, it will be possible to create convincing synthetic interviews with figures, alive or dead, using deepfake technology combined with enough recorded audio. This could cause further damage to trust and credibility, especially within politics and the media. Additionally, they recommend websites such as Abnormal Returns and Blas.com, and emphasize the importance of understanding that everyone has different goals and personalities when it comes to managing their finances.

03:00:00
In this section of the video, Morgan Housel emphasizes the importance of recognizing that individuals have different risk tolerances and therefore may not come to the same conclusion about what's the right thing to do with their money. He notes that it can be hard for people to accept this fact as they often engage in financial debates about how others should invest their money. Housel suggests that before sprinting towards winning the game, one should define a clear understanding of what their game is and what it is not. He also extends his gratitude towards Tim Ferriss for his admiration and compliments on his work.
