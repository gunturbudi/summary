In this section, Dr. Huberman discusses the benefits and trade-offs of using cannabis at different dosages. He emphasizes that the ratio of THC to CBD is important, and high THC concentration cannabis, which is almost pure THC, can be dangerous, particularly for young males in their teens and early 20s, as it can increase the probability of psychotic episodes. However, 2.5 milligrams of THC with CBD is very unlikely to cause problems. Dr. Huberman also talks about the therapeutic benefits of CBD cannabis, which is a powerful anti-epileptic, and should be legally available everywhere, given its lack of psychoactive effects.

In this section of the video, Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses the dangers of high potency THC-containing cannabis, particularly for children and adolescents who are still in the critical period of brain plasticity. He argues that cannabis use is often underestimated and that many people compare it to alcohol to argue that it is not as bad. However, he thinks that using high potency THC-containing cannabis can be as dangerous as using some strong psychedelics, and therefore, people should be cautious and informed about their use of it. Additionally, Dr. Huberman mentions that cannabis has significant therapeutic applications, such as sleep disorders, but that its potency is often underestimated.
