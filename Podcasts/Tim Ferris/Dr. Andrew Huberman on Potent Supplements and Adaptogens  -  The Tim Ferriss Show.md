Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses several potent supplements and adaptogens on The Tim Ferriss Show. For adaptogens, he recommends ashwagandha as a potent cortisol suppressor to be taken in small amounts later in the day, and rhodiola rosea to reduce perceived effort and improve endurance during exercise. Huberman also discusses Tongkat Ali and Fadogia Agrestis as supplements that can mildly enhance libido, increase energy, and overall well-being. He recommends taking doses of 300-600 milligrams per day for Fadogia and 400 milligrams per day for Tongkat Ali. Additionally, Huberman discusses the effects of Doja, a supplement known to increase testicular size to some extent due to stimulation of the luteinizing hormone.

In this section, Dr. Andrew Huberman explains the category of adaptogens and discusses two specific compounds - ashwagandha and rhodiola rosea. Ashwagandha is a potent suppressor of cortisol, meaning it should ideally be taken in low to moderate amounts later in the day, since cortisol levels are naturally high earlier in the day. Rhodiola rosea, on the other hand, is an adaptogen that reduces perceived effort, which leads to greater power and endurance output. Huberman recommends taking around 200 milligrams of rhodiola rosea prior to exercise as it evidently has an effect on the central nervous system by reducing the total amount of adrenaline released during high intensity or long-duration efforts, promoting better recovery, and generating the same amount of physical output in the absence of a large amount of neurochemicals.

In this section, Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses two potent supplements: Tongkat Ali and Fadogia Agrestis. Tongkat Ali is known to increase testosterone levels by decreasing sex hormone binding globulin. It can mildly enhance one's libido, increase energy, and overall well-being. On the other hand, Fadogia stimulates the release of luteinizing hormone, which increases testosterone output from the testes in men, and stimulates downstream luteinizing hormone in women's ovaries, possibly resulting in an increase in testosterone and estrogen. Taking herbal compounds in very high concentrations can trigger an immune response, making 300-600 milligrams per day for fedojia and 400 milligrams per day for Tongkat Ali the recommended dosage. Dr. Huberman doesn't cycle these supplements, as he hasn't felt the need to. People should take a week off every once in a while if that makes them feel more comfortable.

In this section, Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses the effects of a potent supplement called Doja, which is known to increase testicular size to some extent. He explains that this is due to the stimulation of the LH (luteinizing hormone), which can increase the density of the avocado pits. However, the extent of the effects of Doja will depend on the individual's starting point.
