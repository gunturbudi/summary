In this section, Tim Ferriss introduces Brandon Stanton, the creator of the popular storytelling blog Humans of New York, and talks about his accomplishments, including being named one of the 30 Under 30 people changing the world by Time magazine and collaborating with the United Nations. Ferriss then asks Stanton about the first time he got in trouble, to which Stanton shares a childhood memory of sitting in a car and accidentally setting off the alarm. The conversation then moves on to discussing Stanton's college experience, where he flunked out before later returning and graduating with straight A's as a history major.

00:10:00
In this section of the interview, Brandon Stanton discusses his preoccupation with making a big contribution to the world during his early years in school. He spent his time pondering the meaning of life, spirituality, and other big questions. Instead of focusing on what he was supposed to learn, he spent his time smoking weed and trying to come up with a grand idea that would make a significant impact on the world. Eventually, he realized that he needed to focus on improving himself, become disciplined, and start putting one foot in front of the other. By doing this, he was able to get back on track, elevate his grades, and fulfill his dreams.

00:15:00
In this section, Brandon Stanton talks about how he has enjoyed every place that he has lived in and how he appreciates the environment he is in. He finds that people who complain about where they live, tend to externalize their environment as the reason for their dissatisfaction, rather than looking inward. He talks about his earlier stages, like flunking out of college and then getting a job as a bond trader in Chicago, which he took after he became a history major. The catalyst for his daily reading habit of 100 pages/day came from Ben Franklin's autobiography, where the concept of self-improvement was a science for him, and he worked hard at it, leading him to move forward. Brandon emulated him and put in the hard work needed to stick to the routine.

00:20:00
In this section, Brandon Stanton discusses how he became extremely educated and how he read nonfiction books, particularly biographies, every day for seven to eight years. He considers biographies to be the best form of history because they cut through all speculation and reveal the decisions that people made in their lives. He encourages people who are unsure of what they want to do with their lives to read biographies of people they admire. Stanton also recommends reading Ben Franklinâ€™s biography for those who are feeling stuck and Lyndon Johnson's biography for anyone who wants to be president.

00:25:00
In this section, Brandon Stanton shares his fascination with biographies and history. He explains that he's read the most biographies on Theodore Roosevelt and that he's also studied the lives of Adolf Hitler and Stalin, not because he admires them, but because he finds it interesting how educated, smart, and well-meaning people can be pulled into committing such evil acts. Stanton believes that people are inherently good, but it's important to understand how and why people can get pulled into crowd psychology and direct their anger and violence towards others.

00:30:00
In this section of the transcript, Brandon Stanton talks about his experience as a bond trader. He explains that the narrative often painted of him leaving the finance industry to pursue his passion for photography isn't entirely accurate, as he still finds markets fascinating and is fascinated by the psychology behind haggling over the value of items. He discusses how the type of bond trading he participated in was highly leveraged, resulting in huge gains or losses every night, and describes it as playing a high-stakes poker game. Although he was obsessed with bond trading at the time, he admits that he couldn't do it today and that adrenaline was always pumping through his body.

00:35:00
In this section of the interview, Brandon Stanton discusses how he became fixated on money and trading in the financial markets, leading him to lose his job and all of his earnings during the financial crisis in 2008. Stanton admits that he was too narrow-minded and myopic in his focus, unable to talk to his friends about his work or adapt to the changing market conditions. However, he also demonstrates an objective and detached perspective on his experience, acknowledging his own personal responsibility while also recognizing the role of external forces. The conversation also touches on the allure and complexity of finance, particularly in the world of bonds and investing.

00:40:00
In this section, Brandon Stanton discusses the fascinating psychology behind money and risk-taking in the stock market. He mentions how the market can reveal certain aspects of someone's personality, such as their comfort level with risk, but overall, it only tells a limited part of someone's story. Stanton believes that there is so much more to life than the primal desires of wanting more and being afraid to lose that control the markets and ultimately, traders. He also shares his personal experience of becoming consumed by the markets and how it led him to pursue something more artistic.

00:45:00
In this section, Brandon Stanton discusses the turning point in his life when he lost his job and decided to focus on what he truly wanted to do. He realized that he had spent two years solely focused on making money and had never asked himself what he wanted to do with his time. After taking a walk and contemplating, he decided to focus on something that nourished him in the moment rather than solely for profit. This ended up being photography, which eventually led to the creation of Humans of New York. In the early days, he survived on unemployment benefits and just enough money to pay for necessities.

00:50:00
In this section, Brandon Stanton explains how he became obsessed with photography and made a pivot in his career to pursue it full-time. He left behind a lucrative job and sacrificed going out to concerts or restaurants, and spending time with friends to focus exclusively on photography. Stanton moved to New York to pursue his passion, and his goal was to support himself financially through photography while photographing all day long. Initially, he focused on taking candid photographs of people, but he began to ask strangers for portraits, which became his specialty. Stanton eventually discovered that New York was the best place to do this type of photography because he could easily explore the city and capture unique portraits of its people.

00:55:00
In this section, Brandon Stanton discusses his approach to photography and how he never stopped taking photos to learn about photography. He immersed himself in the process and was focused on capturing interesting people and moments rather than adhering to rules and techniques. He admits that this approach may have caused him to improve more slowly than someone who had formal training, but it also allowed him to innovate his own unique style and create the original elements of Humans of New York. He highlights the importance of being engaged and emerged in the process, and mentions that there are many facets to photography beyond just the technical knowledge.

01:00:00
In this section, Brandon Stanton discusses how he honed his photography style by taking thousands of pictures every day and reviewing them on the computer. He didn't worry about conserving film like with traditional cameras, and he learned what he liked about a photo. When he first started putting photos online, he focused on a sweeping project of photographing 10,000 people and posting a few dozen portraits every day on his website. It wasn't until he started posting his photos on social media, particularly Facebook, that Humans of New York started to gain attention and evolve into a personal and immediate focus on the individual. He also recounts the story of the Green Lady, a woman who stands out in his memory as a turning point in his journey as a photographer.

01:05:00
In this section, Stanton shares how he started Humans of New York (HONY) and how it evolved from being a photography project to a platform where people share deep and vulnerable stories about their lives. He realized that his expertise lies not in photography, but in approaching strangers and making them comfortable enough to share their stories. Beginning with a simple photograph and quote about a woman who said she was green one day, HONY grew to millions of followers, becoming a place where people who were curious about the lives of those around them but too afraid to ask could gain insight into the stories of others. Stanton emphasizes that he tries to be as invisible as possible and let the stories speak for themselves, making Humans of New York more influential.

01:10:00
In this section, Brandon Stanton, the creator of Humans of New York, discusses how he initially approached strangers on the streets of New York City to take their photograph and ask them questions. He reveals that his first step was to ask permission to take their photo and explained his website, Humans of New York. In the early days, when he didn't have a following, some people rejected him outright, but he persevered and used trial and error to refine his approach. He learned how to quickly make people feel comfortable and convey the legitimacy of his project to encourage them to participate.

01:15:00
In this section, photographer and Humans of New York creator Brandon Stanton discusses the difficulties he faced in the early days of his career, including the psychological toll of rejection and self-doubt. Stanton talks about spending Christmas Eve alone in a diner and feeling lonely in New York while trying to make a name for himself. Despite the doubts and negative experiences, Stanton's love for his work and obsession with photography helped carry him through the tough times and remain focused on his passion. Stanton's story serves as a reminder that perseverance and a love for one's work can help overcome even the most difficult challenges.

01:20:00
In this section, Brandon Stanton, the creator of Humans of New York, talks about why people share their stories with him. He believes that his success lies in the fact that people feel heard and validated when someone takes a genuine interest in their problems. While there is a fear of vulnerability when talking to a stranger, people appreciate the chance to talk about their deeper struggles. By sharing their honest experiences with him, people connect with others who may be going through similar situations and feel less alone. Ultimately, Humans of New York has succeeded in creating a space for raw and honest conversations about the struggles of everyday life.

01:25:00
In this section, photographer and author Brandon Stanton discusses the ingredients that make his interviews successful. He mentions that having entry questions, such as "What's your biggest struggle?," is helpful but the real key is being 100% present with the person he's interviewing. This means not thinking about the next question or the person's background, but just listening and being curious. Brandon attributes his ability to be present with strangers to years of practice and thousands of conversations, and this energy he brings to the interview is transferred to the other person. Ultimately, his interviews feel less like interviews and more like a conversation with someone who knows and cares about you, which allows people to open up to him even within a short period of time.

01:30:00
done with them. In this section, Brandon Stanton discusses his interviewing technique and how he obtains such powerful and emotional stories from his subjects. He attributes his success to his natural curiosity and willingness to ask difficult questions. Stanton ensures that he gives his subjects agency throughout the entire process and never forces anyone to disclose something they are uncomfortable with. This attitude has led to the success of Humans of New York and its reputation as a platform for honest and vulnerable stories.

01:35:00
In this section, Brandon Stanton discusses his concerns about certain individuals he has interviewed being negatively affected by Humans of New York. He emphasizes that he is deeply invested in the individuals featured on his blog and feels terrible when somebody has a negative experience. Stanton's principle goal for Humans of New York is to raise awareness and support for charity organizations. Although he has been offered a lot of money from big brands, he refuses to rent his brand to anyone and does not want any piece of content to have a single motivation. Stanton mostly sells his speeches and books as Brandon Stanton, and not his brand, Humans of New York.

01:40:00
In this section, Brandon Stanton, the creator of Humans of New York, discusses his initial struggles to find a publisher for his first book, which was seen as both a photography book and a regional book, two categories believed to be difficult to sell. Despite this, he eventually received a small but respectable offer from Macmillan, which he views as his life raft at the time since he had no money. Stanton reflects on his mindset as a creator and his preference for creating something new, rather than making something derivative to appease the marketplace.

01:45:00
In this section, Brandon Stanton discusses the tension between creating something fresh and new versus making something that is comparable to past successes and how this tension is complicated by the need to sustain engagement with his audience on social media. As an artist, Stanton's main goal is to create something new and fresh and to push himself creatively, but this can be difficult when trying to please a risk-averse audience. Stanton also mentions his desire to pull back from the daily output model and focus on longer-term, more polished work, even though this may not be the best move for growing his audience. He plans to work on a documentary in the Philippines and continues to remind himself of the importance of doing what is truly nourishing for him as an artist.

01:50:00
In this section, Brandon Stanton discusses his desire to go to the Philippines to make a documentary, stating that it is something he feels compelled to do, even if it is not necessarily good for business. He talks about this desire as his "North Star," and how he uses it to guide his decision-making. Tim Ferriss recommends the book "Cryptonomicon" by Neal Stephenson, which has a narrative set in the Philippines. Brandon thanks Tim for the conversation, where he was able to tell his story, and encourages listeners to do what is nourishing for them in the moment.

01:55:00
