In this section, Dr. Gabor Maté explains the difference between healthy anger and a suppressed rage, and how the latter can become a survival mechanism for those who experienced boundary transgressions as children. When the boundary transgressions are severe and repeated as a child, suppressing rage becomes a survival mechanism. However, this volcano-like rage does not disappear but rather becomes stored within, and when triggered as an adult, it explodes uncontrollably as memories of past events. Dr. Maté also emphasizes that suppressing healthy anger is also unhealthy as it can lead to the formation of an underlying suppressed rage.

In this section, Dr. Gabor Maté explains the difference between healthy anger and unhealthy rage. He states that while healthy anger is an essential boundary defense mechanism, parenting advice in this culture often forces children to suppress their anger, which is unhealthy. Processing rage involves experiencing the body's physical response to it. To process it effectively, Dr. Maté recommends the RAIN technique: recognize, allow, investigate, and nurture. By fully experiencing the body's sensations of rage and investigating what it's all about, one can nurture the little person who had to suppress all that rage, without suppressing it or acting it out.
