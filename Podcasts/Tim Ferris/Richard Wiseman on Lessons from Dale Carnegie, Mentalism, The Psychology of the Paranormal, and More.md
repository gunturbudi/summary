In this section, Tim Ferriss introduces Richard Wiseman, Britain's only professor in the public understanding of psychology at the University of Hertfordshire, who has published over 100 peer-reviewed articles examining the psychology of magic and illusion, the paranormal, luck, and self-help. Wiseman's books on psychology have sold over three million copies worldwide while his psychology-based YouTube videos have garnered more than 500 million views. They discuss the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, the largest arts festival in the world, and Wiseman's work for eight years as director. Ferriss also asks Wiseman about his paper on experimenter effects and the remote detection of staring, which was published in the late 90s, as Wiseman had been involved in parapsychology for a long time.

00:05:00
In this section, Wiseman explains how he got started in parapsychology, despite being a skeptic who was studying magic. He saw an opportunity to do a PhD at the University of Edinburgh in parapsychology and decided to take it on for four years. One interesting study he conducted during this time was on the remote detection of staring, in which an experimenter would stare at the image of a person in another room and try to affect their physiology. He found that his colleague who believed in the paranormal had significant effects, while his own results were null. He then discusses the issue of replication, which has become a hot topic in science, and how parapsychology has contributed to it. Despite being skeptical, Wiseman found studying the paranormal fascinating and fun, which helped him become an expert in the field.

00:10:00
In this section, Richard Wiseman talks about his membership in the Magic Circle and the importance of community in hobbies and interests. He also explains how practicing magic develops the skills necessary for good psychology since magicians must understand how to move an audience's attention and perception in order to accomplish their tricks. Wiseman believes that magicians are way ahead of academics in the psychology and science of magic and he is impressed by anyone who earns a living doing magic because they have to meet that standard of impressing 100% of their audience every time, even after the show is over. Although most magic does not fool Wiseman anymore, all magicians who maintain their careers impress him.

00:15:00
In this section, the speakers discuss the withholding of secrets within the world of magic to preserve the wondrous experience of the audience. They also bring up examples of performers who have impressed them, such as David Blaine's endurance art and Derek DelGaudio's storytelling in his show "In & Of Itself". Blaine's ability to do genuine and terrifying feats of endurance, paired with his incorporation of street magic and audience reactions in his shows, create an immersive experience for the audience. Similarly, DelGaudio's storytelling and quick memory recall add a new layer of depth to his performances.

00:20:00
In this section, Richard Wiseman defines different types of magic, including close-up magic, street magic, stage magic, mentalism, silent magic, and manipulation with cards and coins. He explains that mentalism involves the fabrication of mental effects such as telepathy, predicting the future or clairvoyance, and emphasizes that this field can also involve psychological illusionism where psychological explanations are given, rather than paranormal ones. Wiseman also discusses mass participation studies and gives an example of his first experiment which involved politicians telling lies and truths on television, then having the public vote on which was which.

00:25:00
In this section, Richard Wiseman, a psychologist and author, discusses his experience conducting a mass participation study on lie detection. The study involved a political interviewer lying and telling the truth on national television while viewers called in to attempt to detect the lies. Wiseman found that people were not very good at detecting lies when watching video or television but became more proficient when focused on verbal cues such as the lack of eye contact and the lack of detail and use of “I,” “me,” and “mine” in the transcript or audio. Wiseman also discusses the mass participation study he conducted to find the world's funniest joke.

00:30:00
In this section, Richard Wiseman discusses the creation of the LaughLab, a website designed to collect data on what people found funny. The website was a huge success, with a million people taking part in the study from around the world, but the team faced challenges with the inappropriate content submitted, requiring the employment of someone whose job was to take out all the rude jokes. Wiseman then discusses Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), a collection of ideas that have some validity but ultimately have parts that do not work at all. He emphasizes the importance of testing these ideas and looking at academic literature to ensure validity before implementing them, especially in cases of lying where it matters.

00:35:00
In this section, Richard Wiseman emphasizes the importance of academic work in psychology and how it underpins many everyday practices like brainstorming. He discusses the importance of conducting relevant research, especially those that are applicable to people's lives, and notes that much of psychology lacks relevance or impact. Wiseman highlights the overwhelming focus on theoretical papers and small-group interests in academic journals and funding agencies and argues that more research should focus on real-life situations, including the self-help literature. He further delves into remote viewing and the fascinating approach taken by the amazing randy to catch students participating in parapsychology studies by providing a checklist for experimenters.

00:40:00
In this excerpt, psychologist and author Richard Wiseman discusses remote viewing, which is the alleged ability to psychically visit a remote location and report on what is there. Wiseman explains that while there isn't much science behind it, most people who claim to be psychic aren't fakes, as it's easy to fool oneself into thinking they have these abilities without consciously faking anything. He uses the example of the biases we all have, such as confirmation bias, that convince people they are psychic when they actually are not. Additionally, Wiseman talks about how he chose some of his book subjects, like "59 Seconds," which was inspired by a challenge from a friend to explain the psychology of happiness in under a minute.

00:45:00
In this section, Wiseman talks about the process behind writing his books "59 Seconds" and "Paranormality". He explains that the title "59 Seconds" was inspired by the idea of reframing, and that he wanted to put out a book that challenged common beliefs. The idea for "Paranormality", on the other hand, was born out of frustration with the paranormal section of bookstores that only featured believer stuff. Wiseman carries out his research work on paranormality for ten years and delves into the psychology behind why people believe in paranormal phenomena. Wiseman also mentions some fun paranormal experiments he's done with remote viewing, ESP, fake séances, and ghost hunting in a royal palace, and shares some weird experiences.

00:50:00
In this section, Wiseman talks about his experience with ghost-busting and dream interpretation. Despite having all sorts of ghost-busting technology, Wiseman believes that primarily it is about the psychology of the situation. He is also fascinated by dreaming as he believes that it helps people knock off the edge of their anxieties or problem solve. Research now shows that dreams are not random but a result of the mind working through anxieties and worries to come up with solutions. Wiseman also talked about lucid dreaming, which he has only experienced once, and his past experience with night terrors.

00:55:00
In this section, the conversation turns to sleep experiences and lucid dreaming. The two discuss methods for inducing lucid dreaming, including keeping a dream journal and waking up early, but note that maintaining the skill can be difficult without consistent effort. They also mention night terrors and note that they can be caused by anxiety and sleeping in a warm environment.

01:00:00
In this section, Wiseman talks about tips for improving sleep quality such as a paradoxical approach to try and stay awake to sleep better, visualization of a positive ending to a nightmare, and distracting yourself with non-stimulating physical activities. He also shares his thoughts on the self-help book genre and mentions Dale Carnegie, author of "How to Win Friends and Influence People" and "How to Stop Worrying and Start Living," as a major influence. He believes that the concepts in these books are simple yet wonderful and he's fascinated by Carnegie, who kept a diary of "damn stupid mistakes" and actively thought about ways to avoid repeating them.

01:05:00
In this section, Richard Wiseman discusses his views on self-development books and the importance of scientific evidence to back up their claims. He notes that some authors write without evidence or belief in their own ideas, leaving readers to make changes based on unfounded advice. He shares his mantra of seeking scientific underpinnings before trusting self-help books. Wiseman also discusses his work on luck beliefs and the development of the luck diary, which resets people's attention on positives and changes self-identity, making people feel luckier in turn. The diary helps people focus on one thing to feel grateful for each day or one negative thing that is no longer present in their lives. Overall, Wiseman encourages readers to blend discernment and critical thinking with trial-and-error approaches to find what works best for them.

01:10:00
In this section, Richard Wiseman discusses his approach to idea generation and how he performs best without a preconceived notion of what a meeting is about. He also shares his thoughts on how schools can do a better job of teaching life skills to kids, and suggests that magic tricks could serve as a useful vehicle for doing just that. Wiseman acknowledges the challenge in finding an engaging vehicle that children will respond to and suggests teaming up with effective teachers. A piece in the New Yorker highlights Wiseman’s career, from professional magician to professor of the public understanding of psychology at the University of Hertfordshire, and provides insight into his delight in demystifying magic and other mind deceptions.

01:15:00
In this section, Richard Wiseman discusses the Yale motivation study, which has been mistakenly cited all over the internet and in self-development books as evidence that focusing on one's career goals at a young age results in greater financial success later in life. The study was never actually conducted, highlighting the importance of fact-checking and going back to original sources for evidence. Wiseman also touches on the dangers of self-reinforcing myths and the importance of not fooling oneself, as demonstrated by the malleability of memory in police investigations and reconstructions.

01:20:00
In this section, Richard Wiseman discusses how our memories and observations are not accurate, and how this can have ramifications in the legal system. He explains that our brains are selective observers, focusing only on what it deems important and missing out on other details. In terms of memory, we do not remember events like replaying a film or videotape; we remember fragments and create a plausible narrative around them. Wiseman explores how suggestibility and the power of reconstruction can impact the legal system, and how this issue affects everyone. Moreover, he briefly touches on the topic of psi phenomena and meta-analyses, and mentions his partner, Professor Caroline Watt, who runs the Edinburgh Parapsychology Unit at Edinburgh University. Although they hold different views on the existence of psi phenomena, both Wiseman and Watt are respected researchers in their fields.

01:25:00
In this section, Richard Wiseman discusses the challenges that creep into experiments involving psychics and how they unintentionally mislead themselves, similar to what happens in mainstream psychology. Wiseman talks about the introduction of pre-registration to mainstream psychology experiments, which is helping to prevent false positives, and similar checks are being introduced into parapsychology studies. Caroline Watt, who helped set up pre-registration within parapsychology, is curious about the anomalies in data but not entirely convinced of the existence of psychic phenomena. The drive for many in the paranormal science field is due to a past inexplicable experience that is life-changing. Wiseman also discusses his study of the psychology used by mission controllers in the Apollo Moon Landings, which came about following a chance party invitation.

01:30:00
In this section, Richard Wiseman discusses his fascination with the psychology behind the Apollo missions that put a man on the moon. He shares how he reached out to the mission controllers, a group of young people from rural backgrounds, who had a can-do attitude and worked as a team to solve problems. Wiseman acknowledges that many people were involved in achieving this incredible feat, but he believes that the mission controllers were at the heart of it. Wiseman also shares some of the items in his background, including a photograph of an acrobatic dancer and a magic door knocker he used in seances.

01:35:00
In this section, Richard Wiseman discusses what he would put on a billboard if he could. He goes back to the simplicity of Dale Carnegie and suggests that the word "smile," or something that would make people smile, would work best. In terms of book recommendations, Wiseman suggests going with Carnegie, stating that it's challenging to beat. He goes on to talk about a few films that he finds inspirational, including Man on Wire and James Randy's Honest Liar, with the latter serving as a cautionary tale to be more skeptical of what is immediately presented before us. Wiseman acknowledges that not all psychics are frauds, and some people genuinely want to help others, but it is essential to have a nuanced approach to the topic.

01:40:00
In this section, the YouTubers discuss the potential pitfalls in working with mediums and bring attention to the fact that photographs can be manipulated through reverse image searches to gather information about people. They then segue into their recommended documentaries, including Richard Turner's documentary on magic, a documentary on the Cirque du Soleil selection process, and the beauty and challenge of show business, citing Darren Brown's show and discussing the adrenaline rush that may be the ultimate motivation for performers. They also talk about the importance of maintaining the freshness of the performance over hundreds of shows.

01:45:00
In this section, Richard Wiseman discusses the importance of avoiding habituation and putting on a fresh show every time. He mentions a technique used by a performer to stand in the wings and reflect on the fact that there will come a time when they are too old to perform, which helps them focus on making that night's show special. Wiseman also reflects on the underlying fascination with the impossible that drives his work, whether it's in the field of paranormal psychology, magic, luck, or changing lives. He encourages people to keep pushing the boundaries of what is considered possible to achieve.
