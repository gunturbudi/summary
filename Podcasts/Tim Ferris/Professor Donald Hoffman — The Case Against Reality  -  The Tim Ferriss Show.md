Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=9qJJP6S15V0

In the video, Professor Donald Hoffman discusses the case against reality, arguing that our senses do not shape us to see the truth about the world around us. Instead, they shape us to interact with reality in ways that are beneficial for our survival and reproduction. He also discusses the implications of quantum computing and how it could lead to advancements in physics and technology.
In the video, Professor Donald Hoffman argues that consciousness is the only thing that exists, and that everything else is just an interface that our consciousness creates. He also discusses how his work in mathematics and spiritual traditions has led him to believe that there is an infinite intelligence that transcends any finite conceptual system.
In this video, Professor Donald Hoffman discusses his theory that spirituality can be explained using mathematics and science. He notes that he has not experienced any backlash from the scientific community. He discusses how evolutionary theory has been turned into mathematics called evolutionary game theory, and how allowing organisms to cluster their payoff functions into similar objects can lead to them seeing fake objects instead of the truth.

The professor discusses the Helmholtz Club, a group of neuroscientists who met once a month to discuss consciousness. He explains that the goal of the club was to solve the mystery of conscious experience, which had been an open question for decades. He tells the story of how Francis Crick made the case for consciousness being a problem that needed to be addressed, and how he himself began his career as an assistant professor in the club.

In his talk "Do We See Reality As It Is?", Professor Donald Hoffman discusses how humans perceive reality, and how some things, like the moon, are seen clearly while other things, like molecules, are not seen at all. Hoffman also discusses the idea of reality being "perceived" rather than "seen", and how this relates to our understanding of consciousness.

00:10:00
The video discusses the idea that our senses do not shape us to see the truth about the world around us. Instead, they shape us to interact with reality in ways that are beneficial for our survival and reproduction.

00:15:00
The professor discusses how evolutionary theory has given us icons that allow us to control reality, and how this affects our understanding of consciousness. He says that 95 percent of those studying consciousness assume that certain objects in space and time are real, and that they have causal powers.

00:20:00
In this video, Professor Donald Hoffman discusses his theory that space and time are not fundamental, and that the idea of objects in space and time is an abstraction. He also discusses how reductionism and space-time have been successful assumptions of science for centuries, but that there is a limit to how small one can go with these theories.

00:25:00
In his talk "Professor Donald Hoffman - The Case Against Reality," Donald Hoffman discusses how reductionism is false and space time is doomed. He goes on to discuss how the theory of consciousness is based on reductionism and how it is wrong. He ends the talk by saying that science can never have a theory of everything, but that this doesn't mean that there is no hope for understanding consciousness.

00:30:00
In his video, Professor Donald Hoffman discusses the case against reality, which is that every scientific theory will have assumptions that are the miracles and can never be explained. He cites the example of girls in completeness theorem and how it shows that any finite axiomatization of mathematics will have truths that cannot be proven from within that system. He also points out that any conceptual scheme will only barely scratch the surface of reality, and that this is a humbling point of view.

00:35:00
The physicist Professor Donald Hoffman discusses the concept of the holographic universe, which suggests that the universe is actually a series of holograms. According to this model, the time on the boundary of a hologram is the same as the time in the bigger space in the 'bulk'. This has implications for the theory of space-time, which Hoffman says is doomed because it does not take into account the surface area of a black hole.

00:40:00
The video discusses the implications of quantum computing and how it could lead to advancements in physics and technology. Professor Donald Hoffman discusses what might happen in the next 10-20 years as we begin to revise how we think of reality and matter.

00:45:00
The video discusses Professor Donald Hoffman's theory that consciousness arises as an interface between space and time, and that certain structures found behind space-time aresimplifications of the long-term behavior of conscious agents. If this theory were correct, it would suggest that the structures found behind space-time are only projections of the full dynamics of consciousness.

00:50:00
In this video, Professor Donald Hoffman discusses the fundamental error of taking a bottom-up approach to understanding consciousness, which is starting with the neurological structures and using our space-time tools to kind of build from the smallest up to explain the phenomenology and the subjective experience that people have that they label consciousness. Hoffman argues that, if consciousness is localized, then understanding there is a lot of controversy around this topic would be a good place to start, as there are many different types of injuries where people can use it as proof for or against the idea. However, Hoffman believes that this is an assumption that is based on false assumptions, as nothing in space and time has any causal powers. Everything inside space and time are merely perceptions within consciousness.

00:55:00
The professor discusses physicalism and its implications for death. He argues that if consciousness is fundamental, then it will ultimately dissolve upon death.

01:00:00
According to Professor Donald Hoffman, consciousness is all there is, and the exploration of its potentialities is unending. Hoffman argues that, because there is no end to the exploration, consciousness itself is always learning and evolving. This, in turn, means that awareness is perfectly fine the way it is - raw and unrefined.

01:05:00
In this video, Professor Donald Hoffman discusses the concept of panpsychism, which is the belief that everything, including particles and atoms, has a unit of consciousness. Hoffman believes that this concept can be taken too seriously, and that space time and particles are still fundamental reality. He suggests that Philip Goff, a famous panpsychist cyclist, could have a good discussion about the topic.

01:10:00
This professor discusses the idea that certain physical systems also have a unit of consciousness, or integrated information, which would make them alive. He also discusses the work of two brilliant scientists, Christophe Coog and Julia Tanoni, who are studying this theory.

01:15:00
In this video, Professor Donald Hoffman discusses how the scattering data from particle collisions can be used to reveal deeper symmetries in reality. He explains how calculations can be simplified using space-time concepts, and how this has led to new discoveries about the nature of reality.

01:20:00
In this video, Professor Donald Hoffman discusses the neuroscience behind hallucinogenic drugs and how they could be used to access new portals into reality. Hoffman points out that from a physicalist perspective, these drugs are just brain malfunctions, but from a standpoint of consciousness being fundamental, they may still be real.

01:25:00
The professor discusses the possible benefits and drawbacks of using drugs in an attempt to open up new portals into the realm of conscious agents. He points out that there is evidence that certain drugs are consistently associated with shared visions and experiences among those who take them.

01:30:00
The video presents Professor Donald Hoffman's arguments that plants have capabilities we never thought they could, and that this should be considered when trying to understand reality. Hoffman also recommends a book called "Thus Spoke the Plant," which discusses Monica Gagliano's experiences with plant-human communication.

01:35:00
In this video, Professor Donald Hoffman talks about how the idea that reality is simply an interface between space and time is a false assumption. He also talks about the work of Chris Fuchs and David Merman, two physicists who have proposed a theory called Cubism which is very similar to the ideas that Hoffman is discussing.

01:40:00
In this video, Professor Donald Hoffman discusses the idea that reality is not what is appears to be, and that it can be proven that certain outcomes did not exist before they were observed. Einstein was wrong in his assumption that reality is based on what can be measured.

01:45:00
Professor Donald Hoffman discusses his recent research on information theory and consciousness, and how spiritual teachers may have insights that are not currently being explored by scientists. He also mentions his own attitude towards scientific theories, and how he believes that all of them will eventually be replaced by new theories that better understand the nature of reality.

01:50:00
In this video, Professor Donald Hoffman discusses the convergence of spiritual practices and mathematics, and how this has led to the development of probabilistic models of consciousness. Hoffman discusses how his work has led him to see a correspondence between the two fields, and how this understanding has helped him to see that what we see and think is not truly ourselves.

01:55:00
In this YouTube video, Professor Donald Hoffman discusses how some of the concepts found in spiritual traditions, such as the idea of an infinite intelligence that transcends any finite conceptual system, correspond well with mathematical concepts he has written down. Hoffman also discusses the idea of good and bad pointers and how they can be made more rigorous.

02:00:00
Professor Donald Hoffman discusses his theory that spirituality can be explained using mathematics and science, and he notes that he has not experienced any backlash from the scientific community.

02:05:00
Professor Donald Hoffman discusses how evolutionary theory has been turned into mathematics called evolutionary game theory, and how allowing organisms to cluster their payoff functions into similar objects can lead to them seeing fake objects instead of the truth.

02:10:00
In this video, Professor Donald Hoffman discusses the nature of science and how it is never-ending, with the goal of getting deeper and deeper theories. He also discusses the Girdle's incompleteness theorem, which tells us that this process will never end.
