He also discusses blending the developmental framework of Western psychotherapy with the fruitional view of improving your ability to change your lens and relate to your circumstances differently.

He urges that it is possible to move past the fear and despair of the pandemic and hold compassion towards oneself and others.

00:25:00
In this section, Jack Kornfield talks about how we can prepare our hearts amidst the spread of COVID-19. He shares a story of a woman during the siege of Leningrad who, after picking up her bread, gave half of it to a young girl who had dropped hers, giving her hope to survive the siege. He highlights how the virus can bring out the best in us, and it is an opportunity for us to become more altruistic. While difficult times can reveal character, Kornfield believes that anyone can let their spirit shine even in the face of adversity. Finally, Kornfield shares that it is natural to feel worry, but we can observe our thoughts and understand our tendencies to overcome it, and to let empathy drive our actions.

00:30:00
In this section, Jack Kornfield shares his perspective on finding a bigger perspective during the times of the pandemic, quoting the Ojibwa Indian Native Americans' belief that even in difficult times, they are being carried by great winds across the sky. He reminds people that they are not just their personalities, history, or small sense of selves but a spirit that was born into their bodies being carried by vastness. Kornfield then talks about how to relate to death and mortality by sharing a personal story of his twin brother who was a geneticist and world explorer who eventually died of leukemia. He reflects on how we can learn to face death in a different way by embracing our loving awareness and finding peace amid the looming specter of death.

00:35:00
In this section, Jack Kornfield shares a personal experience of how he meditated with a dying friend and taught him to be present with his experiences. Through meditation, Kornfield accesses the four dimensions of freedom - the ability to be present with the content of one's experiences, the awareness of one's true nature, the realization of the interconnectedness of all things, and the ability to act and serve from a place of love and compassion. Through these dimensions of freedom, Kornfield teaches the importance of training in inner capacities of presence and offers guidance on how to find peace amidst the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:40:00
In this section, meditation teacher Jack Kornfield discusses the importance of acknowledging one's emotions, including loneliness and love. Kornfield explains the freedom that comes from recognizing one's common humanity and understanding that suffering is not personal, but rather part of the human experience. He also touches on the different kinds of tears a person can shed, including tears of trauma as well as tears of the Dharma. Kornfield emphasizes the importance of holding all experiences with compassion and awareness, which can lead to deeper insights and a wider, more open heart.

00:45:00
In this section, Jack Kornfield shares a conversation he had with his teacher Rajan Mun about the different dimensions of freedom. Mun told Kornfield that experiences in meditation, no matter how beautiful or insightful, are just movies on a screen, and the real point is to turn your attention back to the one who knows, to become the witness of all experiences. As you become familiar with the fact that you are the witnessing consciousness, you enter even greater dimensions of freedom, where wisdom and love intersect. Kornfield notes that these dimensions of freedom allow you to enter the terrain of birth and death with a wise and spacious heart.

00:50:00
In this section, Jack Kornfield gives advice on dealing with anxiety and fear during the COVID-19 pandemic and reminds us to approach these difficult emotions with tenderness and compassion. He suggests sitting down and holding your worries with kindness, as well as acknowledging that you and your loved ones are okay for now. Kornfield also recommends connecting with nature and grounding yourself like a tree, rooting yourself in the earth and finding steadiness and flexibility. Lastly, he suggests creating a mental altar to place your worries and fears, surrounded by sacred images, symbols, or people that inspire you.

00:55:00
In this section, Jack Kornfield shares some practices to find peace amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the practices is to write down your fears, emotions, and stories, fold the paper, and place it on your altar or in front of a spiritual figure to let them hold your fears while you focus on taking care of your family and community. Another practice is to link your consciousness with others who are steady and calm in the world right now, such as physicians, nurses, and parents who attend to each other with calmness. He also advises not to be squeamish about letting things go and to remember that it's called practice, not perfect, so one can always try again to center and find calmness.

01:00:00
In this section, Jack Kornfield explains how identification can lead us to believe we are smaller than our true selves, which are bigger than the labels and identifiers given to us during our incarnation. He goes on to discuss archetypes and the specific archetype of Quan Yin, an icon of universal compassion, who is a symbol of what lives within us and how we can choose to water and tend to the positive seeds in our consciousness to allow them to blossom.

01:05:00
In this section, Kornfield discusses the concept of watering the seeds of peace in ourselves and cultivating compassion in consciousness. He emphasizes that spirituality should not be approached as a grim duty, but rather as a way to perfect love in our lives, accepting ourselves with all our imperfections. Kornfield also talks about the use of sacred medicines in different spiritual cultures throughout history and how they can help us remember who we truly are. Although these medicines are powerful and can be scary, they have a long tradition of use in helping people to see beyond the conventional reality and reconnect with their spiritual selves.

01:10:00
In this section, Jack Kornfield discusses the benefits of using psychedelics as a tool for personal growth and self-discovery. He notes that these substances can assist in shifting one's identity and facilitating healing from past traumas, however, they must be approached with caution as they can also be misused and pose risks to certain individuals. Kornfield suggests that when used as a sacrament or a sacred medicine, and in the right set and setting, psychedelics can offer profound experiences that have the potential to complement one's meditation practice and lead to greater compassion and understanding.

01:15:00
In this section, Jack Kornfield talks about the interconnectedness of all things and the different ways that we can experience it, such as through nature or in moments of love and death. He also discusses the responsible use of sacred medicines like psychedelics, cautioning against overuse or misuse and emphasizing the need for respect, preparation, and integration. Kornfield highlights that these tools are not magic cures and that they should be approached as opportunities for healing and understanding, taken with consideration to their potential impacts on the individual. Finally, he touches on the concept of development and fruition, becoming conscious and aware of the interconnectedness that we all share.

01:20:00
In this section, Jack Kornfield discusses the importance of doing inner work even if you have experienced a profound spiritual experience or psychedelic trip. He emphasizes that we are multi-dimensional beings and must allow ourselves to develop compassion and open the window of tolerance to heal our trauma. Kornfield also highlights the mystery of sleep and how it is a glimpse into our connection with everything. He discusses why people may turn to suicide as a way to free themselves from the burden of self-centeredness, and how psychedelics can provide temporary relief from this prison.

01:25:00
In this section, Jack Kornfield emphasizes the importance of practicing meditation regularly and sitting with difficult emotions or thoughts every day for a consecutive 30-day period before considering a larger psychedelic experience. He suggests that smaller experiences may prepare us for larger ones as drinking from a water fountain comes before drinking from a garden hose, and then a firehose. Kornfield also acknowledges the importance of a safe and supportive setting for larger experiences and emphasizes the need for a sitter who is not taking the substance to provide a sense of protection. Lastly, Kornfield shares insights from Stan Grof's book, "The Cosmic Game," as a framework for understanding the nature of consciousness and the importance of dealing with trauma that comes up in both meditation and psychedelic experiences.

01:30:00
In this section, Jack Kornfield discusses the power of mystical experiences and its role in healing people who have experienced trauma, depression, or addiction. The studies done at Hopkins show that individuals who have full-blown deep mystical experiences in the right setting have a significant shift in their lives. Kornfield also talks about trauma and its long-term effects. He emphasizes the importance of being aware of and managing trauma as it can lead to over vigilance, unhealthy addiction patterns, and a life in the past.

01:35:00
In this section, Jack Kornfield explains the importance of understanding trauma and how it impacts our bodies and hearts. Trauma is an experience of suffering that is locked into one's body and mind which, if not processed and released, can become a major part of one's life in an unconscious way. Kornfield provides an example of how animals release trauma through physical movement after facing a life-or-death situation. In order to release trauma in humans, it happens in different dimensions, including through recognizing memories, feeling emotions, and having a safe space and compassionate presence.

01:40:00
summarize this section as Jack Kornfield shares his experience of working with combat veterans who cannot share their horrific stories with anyone because it's too difficult for them. Kornfield suggests that when combat veterans come together in a safe place and create a ritual where they light a candle and make a ritual space, they can hold the suffering and the horrors they have lived through, and humanity of it can be felt. However, telling the story is very difficult as it signifies a betrayal of the soul. The fact that they can tell their stories to someone who can understand and have a loving gaze can have an enormous transformative effect on them, making them feel welcomed back into the community. Kornfield also shares his experience of dealing with his own trauma, suggesting that the healing of the body, emotions, and heart, and the story, are all dimensions of the healing process.
