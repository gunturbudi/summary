00:25:00
In this video, Sam Harris, Dr. Peter Attia, Ramit Sethi, and Elizabeth Gilbert discuss the challenges of trying to achieve lasting happiness and success in life. They note that, due to the constantly shifting tides of culture and expectations, our goals and priorities often change, and we spend our time and attention in ways that are proportionate to what we actually value. Meditation is a practice that can help us call off the search and achieve a state of "doing nothing," which is important because it allows us to reflect on what is truly important in life.

00:30:00
This video discusses the benefits of meditation and how it can help free one from the struggles of everyday life. It says that, although meditation may initially seem difficult, it is actually free of effort and can simply be experienced as a natural occurrence. Once one becomes aware of this, the real freedom to do nothing lies within recognizing that everything is already happening on its own.

00:35:00
The "Waking Up" app offers short, reflective pieces on how to live a more fulfilling life. One lesson is on the practice of meditation, which is not meant to be good for you but to help you begin again in each moment. The app also offers occasional longer pieces on different topics.

This would need to be done in concert with other interventions, such as lowering LDL cholesterol and reducing blood pressure.

Beck's experience of losing her family and her marriage led her to do an "integrity cleanse" in which she lost all contact with her family and stopped lying to social conventions.
