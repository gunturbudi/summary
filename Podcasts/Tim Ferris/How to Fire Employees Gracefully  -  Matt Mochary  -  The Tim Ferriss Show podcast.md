Matt Mochary discusses how to fire employees gracefully by recognizing it as a major life trauma for the individual. He suggests helping the person take the first few steps after the termination, which will create a sense of relief for the remaining employees and help remove fear, thus improving performance. If an employee is stuck in a role they don't like, it's important to find a role that aligns with their interests, or else it's best to let them go. Having a conversation to find out their interests can help determine a better fit, but if they refuse to share or don't want to be coached, there's nothing you can do.

In this section, Matt Mochary discusses how to fire employees gracefully by recognizing that it is a major life trauma for the individual. When someone experiences trauma, their brain doesn't work well and they find it difficult to advocate for themselves and do a job search. Therefore, the manager can help take the first few steps for the person so they don't have to do it all on their own. Treating the person well and helping them will create a sense of relief for the remaining employees, which will remove fear and improve performance. Matt also discussed the instance of problem employees who have such extreme incompetence that they can't be reassigned to any other role, he suggests waiting till anger dissipates and getting curious about what the person's passion is, which almost always can be translated into some kind of money-making effort.
