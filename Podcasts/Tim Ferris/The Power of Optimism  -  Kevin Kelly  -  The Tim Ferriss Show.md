In this section, the conversation delves into the idea that while it's good to be optimistic and active, one cannot be active about everything; one has to prioritize and choose certain things to focus on. For example, while there is a greater than zero chance of an asteroid impacting Earth, the probability is so low that it shouldn't impact national policy decisions.
