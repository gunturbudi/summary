In this section, Seneca advises that while he cannot prescribe the proper actions to take to remove oneself from depraved pursuits, one must be present and watchful in mind to seize the fleeting opportunity to do so. He suggests that one should withdraw from the current existence or take a gentle path to loosen the knot that has been bungled badly and tied rather than cut it entirely. Seneca believes that one should not be struggling for something further but rather should call a halt and be content with what one has lowered oneself to. Epicurus advises that we should hope for a safe release from even the hardest trials provided that we are not in too great a hurry before the time nor too dilatory when the time arrives.

In this section, the author, Seneca, advises his friend Lucilius to focus on performing tasks that are worthwhile and not waste time on meaningless or discreditable work.

He reminds Lucilius that death is inevitable and urges him to focus on achieving a life without desires or fears, free from superstitions and treachery.
