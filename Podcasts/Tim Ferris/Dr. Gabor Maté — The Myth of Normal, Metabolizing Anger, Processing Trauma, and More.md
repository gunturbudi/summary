Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Dr. Gabor Maté discusses the harmful effects of residential schools, how to apply the teachings in one's life, and the recent discovery of mass graves in Canada.

00:05:00
Dr. Gabor Maté discusses how the experience of love and presence is not a common experience for many people, and how his background of growing up in Hungary during the Holocaust, and persecution of Jews after the Holocaust, has led to a greater appreciation for nature.

00:10:00
Dr. Gabor Maté discusses the psychological effects of trauma and how traditional healers can help. He tells a story of being separated from his mother at a young age and how the shaman assigned to help him cleared out much of the trauma. He worries that the science practiced gap will prevent Westerners from understanding and resolving traumatic experiences.

00:15:00
Dr. Gabor Maté discusses how certain emotional patterns become ingrained in the basic survival mechanisms of the brain, and how these can lead to difficulties in processing trauma and related emotions. After recounting his experience of holding a group of people who had participated in a five-night ceremony to clear trauma, he discusses the aftereffects on those participants. He says that eventually everyone can learn to clear trauma on their own by practicing patience and meditation.

00:20:00
Dr. Gabor Maté discusses how trauma can affect everyday life, and how his book, "The Myth of Normal," is based on years of research. He talks about how his book is visual excitement, coupled with the fear that he isn't big enough to do it.

00:25:00
Dr. Gabor Maté discusses the role of anger in trauma and how it can show up in our lives in different ways. He shares the story of a successful neuroscientist who died of cancer, and how his work distinguising different brain systems for mammalian behavior helped him understand the role of anger in trauma. He explains that healthy anger is in the moment, protects boundaries, and then disappears. If anger is suppressed as a result of childhood trauma, it can continue to be a problem in later life.

00:30:00
The speaker discusses the difference between healthy anger and rage, and how to approach processing that anger. He recommends that individuals experience the body experience of rage in order to better understand and understand what is happening. Additionally, he mentions that there are ways to work with anger without either suppressing or acting out.

00:35:00
Dr. Gabor Maté discusses the concept of "radical acceptance," which he defines as "acceptance that this is the way it is right now." He also discusses the concept of "attachment versus authenticity," noting that, in most cases, we react to events rather than interpreting them. He offers the example of a taxi ride, in which the passenger may feel conflict between wanting to be direct and not hurting their partner's feelings, and then reacting to the interpretation of what happened in the taxi ride. He goes on to say that, in general, we experience similar conflicts when trying to reconcile our need for attachment (i.e., wanting our partner to accept us) with our need for authenticity (i.e., being ourselves). He asks the listeners to help him explore this concept further by sharing their own experiences of conflict between attachment and authenticity.

00:40:00
In this video, Dr. Gabor Maté discusses the dilemma of being authentic and being accepted by others. He argues that the two are inextricably linked and that when one is sacrificed, the other is also affected. He also discusses the impact of suppressed authenticity on mental and physical health.

00:45:00
Dr. Gabor Maté discusses the idea that some mental health conditions are inherited, but that this does not mean that the individual is sick. He goes on to say that the more sensitive a person is, and the more they are genetically predisposed to feel, the more they will be vulnerable to reacting to pain in a way that is harmful to them. He also discusses the importance of helping children learn to regulate their emotions and cope with frustration.

00:50:00
The author discusses how abnormal social norms and expectations create abnormal responses in people, which can result in problems such as obesity, addiction, and depression. He also discusses how books, parenting practices, and school systems can reinforce these norms. He argues that society needs to shift its focus from external measures of success to internal measures of well-being, and points to examples of how this shift is happening in some areas of society.

00:55:00
Dr. Gabor Maté discusses the rise in childhood suicide and the connection between stress and trauma in today's society. He suggests ways for individuals to heal and reconnect with themselves.

01:00:00
Dr. Gabor Maté discusses the importance of communality of connection and the harmful effects of parenting approaches that focus on behavior instead of underlying emotional dynamics. He also discusses the problem of trauma and how it can lead to aggression and drug use in individuals and in groups. He argues that understanding the drivers of these behaviors is key to supporting healthy growth.

01:05:00
In this video, Dr. Gabor Maté discusses how we can help reduce the level of anger and violence in society by understanding the social, cultural, and psychological factors that contribute to it. He also mentions the film The Work, which is about his work helping high-level offenders heal their trauma.

01:10:00
Dr. Gabor Maté discusses the importance of understanding and recognizing the root cause of people's actions in order to rehabilitate them. He discusses his experiences working within a maximum security prison, and how the combination of violent events, lack of opportunities, and sensitive individuals makes rehabilitation difficult. Maté also discusses the potential of rehabilitation for those who are not eligible for parole and who have experienced multiple abuses.

01:15:00
Dr. Gabor Maté talks about how his difficult upbringing led to struggles with addiction, trauma, and other issues, and how he views his clinical practice. He recommends the book, "The Myth of Normal," and mentions that he's seen you in documentaries.

01:20:00
Dr. Gabor Maté discusses the importance of silence and how it can be difficult to "hear" the small voice inside of us, but it is essential to follow through with our projects. He encourages the listener to experiment with silence and ask themselves a question. If nothing comes up, that is okay.

01:25:00
Dr. Gabor Maté discusses the appeal of pure, unadulterated knowledge in animals and how this interest translates to something that he can spend time on. He admits that he is unsure of how to pursue this interest and asks the audience for advice.

01:30:00
In this video, Dr. Gabor Maté discusses the idea that people who have experienced trauma often have a difficult time trusting their own authenticity, due to the fact that authenticity can lead to trouble. He urges people to take the next step and trust the process, rather than figuring everything out in advance.
