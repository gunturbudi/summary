In this section, Tim Ferriss introduces his guest, Danny Meyer, the founder of Union Square Hospitality Group, USHG and Shake Shack. Ferriss provides a brief background on Meyer and his achievements, including winning numerous James Beard Awards, being named as one of Time Magazine's most influential people, and authoring the New York Times Bestseller Setting the Table. Ferriss proceeds to ask Meyer about the origins of the name "Maialino," the Italian word for little pig, which is also the name of one of Meyer's acclaimed restaurants. Meyer explains that the name derives from his first job as a tour guide in Rome, where he frequently dined at a trattoria called "La Taverna da Giovanni." The staff there initially referred to him affectionately as "Meyerino," but the nickname eventually morphed into "Maialino," because of Meyer's love for roast suckling pig.

In this section, Danny Meyer reveals to Tim Ferriss that he hates surprises and considers himself a little bit of a control freak, stating he likes to have a false sense that he has some say in the matter. Meyer recalls how his grandfather once taught him the expression, "Man plans, and God laughs", highlighting that although one might think they're planning for success or situations, the world usually has other ideas for them. Tim Ferriss offers the metaphor that writing a novel is like driving a car cross-country with headlights on, where one cannot see where they are going, but enough in front of them to know they are heading in the right direction. Before Meyer became a restauranteur, he was a salesman that sold electronic tags to stop shoplifters and states he decided to take the law degree instead of a journalism degree.

00:10:00
In this section, Danny Meyer, the founder of Shake Shack, recalls a conversation he had with his uncle, Richard, that changed his life. He was on the eve of taking his LSATs, preparing for a career he didn't have any interest in. His uncle asked him, "Do you have any idea how long you're going to be dead anyway?" and that made Meyer realize that he should be doing something he's passionate about instead of pursuing a career he has no interest in. His uncle suggested opening a restaurant, which Meyer believed wasn't a valid entrepreneurial career choice at that time, but he enrolled in a restaurant management class and got his first job as an assistant lunch manager. Through that job, he realized his love for the business and met his future wife.

In this section, Danny Meyer talks about the pivotal moments that led to his success in the restaurant industry. He shares personal anecdotes of how chance encounters and unlikely circumstances ultimately led him to his career.

Overall, Meyer attributes his success to a combination of chance, hard work, and his natural ability to connect with and understand others.

00:20:00
In this section, Danny Meyer talks about his success in sales being driven by curiosity and the art of collecting dots. In his early sales job at Checkpoint Systems, Meyer would research and learn as much as he could about the business he was selling to and the person he was meeting with. He also took an interest in the people he was selling to, learning their family histories and relationships to better connect with them. He advises always collecting dots to connect them later and recommends showing interest in others if you want them to show interest in you. Meyer's secret to staying motivated during his sales job was organizing his schedule around trying new lunch spots in the city, in addition to business meetings.

00:25:00
In this section, Danny Meyer talks about his journey to becoming a chef, which involved going to Italy and France to learn from the best chefs. He shares his experience working as a stage, which is when a cook works for free to learn from experienced chefs. Meyer says that working for free is a good way to build a career in the food industry and learn from the best. He only had to pay for a cooking teacher in Milan who claimed to be the Julia Child of Italy but was not. Otherwise, he did many stages where he was not paid anything.

00:30:00
In this section, Danny Meyer explains the benefits of being patient when growing a business and emphasizes the importance of truly learning the business by understanding and motivating all five stakeholders - staff, guests, community, suppliers, and investors. Meyer shares that it took him 10 years to open a second restaurant because of his fear of going bankrupt like his dad, but that this time allowed him to truly learn about his business. He also reveals that he still reads nightly reservation reports and after service reports to understand who his guests are and how to connect the dots to create personalized experiences for them. Additionally, he stresses the importance of investing in the community and getting to know your suppliers to ensure quality products.

In this section of the video, Danny Meyer shares two important life lessons he learned from his grandmother. The first was about treating employees the right way and how it's critical to choose the right people for the job, just like picking the best tomatoes to make the best sauce. The second lesson was about watering the flowers instead of pulling weeds, as the flowers will crowd out the weeds on their own. This lesson taught him that employees are like sunflowers and will turn towards the leader, so it's essential to spend more time with those who are doing great work than trying to motivate those who are not. Meyer also lists the five stakeholders, and he prioritizes them in his business in the following order: employees, guests, community, suppliers, and investors.

00:40:00
In this section, Danny Meyer, founder of Shake Shack, talks about his approach to treating employees as volunteers, meaning that he treats them like they chose to work there even though they could have gotten other job offers. He believes that happy employees lead to happy customers and happy investors, which creates a virtuous cycle. He also emphasizes the importance of genuine sentiment in communication, citing his love for writing and his father's editing expertise. He believes that it's important to show genuine appreciation for those who reach out and connect with you.

00:45:00
In this section, Tim Ferriss and Danny Meyer discuss the etiquette of politely declining invitations and the importance of giving a gracious response. Danny shares his method for deciding whether or not to accept an invitation, which involves determining whether it is something he really wants to do and can do, and whether it is a "should" or a "want to." He stresses the importance of responding to invitations with courtesy and care, noting that all the person is guilty of is showing interest in you. Tim also asks Danny about his approach to hiring and the six qualities he looks for, including kindness, empathy, and self-awareness, with associated questions to ask potential candidates.

In this section, Danny Meyer, founder of Shake Shack, discusses the six things he looks for when hiring for his restaurant, which includes kind optimists, curious individuals, those with an excellent work ethic, empathetic people, self-aware individuals, and those with integrity. He emphasizes the importance of having a team that loves to win and strives for excellence. Meyer shares four buckets of motivation for individuals striving to be champions: those motivated by a love of beating someone else, those motivated by not wanting to lose, those motivated to exceed their personal best, and those who are simply not that competitive.

always admired and I ask him, "What did you learn from watching the Houston Astros win the World Series a week ago?" And he responded by saying, "Oh, that's easy. They had a hurricane and decided to play their next game, and it was really hard for them, but they knew that they were doing something that could put smiles on other people's faces, and they did it anyway." From this story, Danny Meyer learned that just like in baseball, hospitality is a team sport, and your job is to make the rest of your team better, whether you're on the field or in the dugout.

01:00:00
In this section, Danny Meyer discusses a conversation he had with Theo Epstein, who was rooting for the Dodgers to win the World Series, not because of the Cubs but because he knows the champions don't do enough off-season to improve their team, which will make it easier for the Cubs to compete in the next season. This taught Meyer the lesson that when people think they are doing well or on top of the game, it is crucial to break the glass and start over to keep up with the changes. Meyer believes that to evaluate staff's performance, one must look beyond technical stats and focus on their behavior and character during family meals or conversations to identify who's bringing motivating thoughts, who's asking questions, and who's being pessimistic. Although Meyer has struggled in the past to let go of people, he has now gotten better at it and learned that anything that doesn't work out in the team should be let go of instead of moving people around to keep them.

01:05:00
In this section, Danny Meyer, founder of Shake Shack, discusses how he struggled with firing people who were underperforming or toxic to his team. With the realization that his business is not a family, he created a model with a four-quadrant matrix that identifies the employee's technical skills (can/can't) and his emotional willingness (will/won't.) Meyer explains that he has a plan of action and a timeframe for each quadrant. He celebrates employees who can and will, coaches those who can't but will, puts a short candle wick for those who can't and won't, and has a shorter timeframe for the can but won't group. With this framework, he can identify where an employee is on the matrix and take appropriate measures.

01:10:00
In this excerpt, Danny Meyer discusses his approach to creating a positive company culture by minimizing unwanted behaviors. He explains that culture is the sum of all the wanted behaviors that are celebrated, minus all the unwanted behaviors that are tolerated. Meyer also emphasizes the importance of having a conversation with employees about performance and behavior long before it is necessary to let them go. He uses the analogy of a jigsaw puzzle to explain that employees who are almost right but not the right fit can cause damage to the whole organization if they are not addressed. Overall, Meyer's focus on honest communication and fostering a positive work environment has contributed to the success of his many ventures.

01:15:00
In this section, Danny Meyer, founder of Shake Shack, discusses his experience with failures and the lessons he learned from them. He emphasizes that every day brings micro failures, but the only real failure is the failure to try. Meyer shares his own experience of closing his restaurant, Tabla, after keeping it open for two years longer than he should have. He reflects on the mistake he made when he proudly stated that he had never closed a restaurant in his book, Setting the Table, and explains how he turned the situation around by focusing on how well they closed the restaurant instead of how well they opened it. He and his team made sure to be transparent with their staff, landlord, and community and celebrated the restaurant's legacy by inviting alumni chefs to cook with them and hosting job fairs for their team members.

01:20:00
In this section, Danny Meyer discusses his experience closing down his restaurant Tabla and how he learned that closing down is not necessarily a shameful act. He had to close down several other restaurants during the COVID-19 pandemic, but he believes that the true failure is not trying at all. Instead of longevity, he aims for essentiality in his restaurants, where they become a crucial part of people's lives. He likens it to a song or a piece of art that makes one's life better, and losing it would feel like losing something essential. Later in the conversation, Tim Ferriss asks Meyer about his experiment with eliminating tipping, which started due to a shortage of quality cooks.

01:25:00
In this section, Danny Meyer, the founder of Shake Shack, talks about how he came up with the idea of Hospitality Included, which eliminated the tipping system for his restaurants. Meyer wanted to attract more cooks by narrowing the wage gap between cooks and servers since raising the cook's wage would result in increased menu prices and disparity with the servers' wage. The Hospitality Included idea included everything in the menu prices, even the service charge to make a diner feel like they are paying for how the restaurant made them feel.

01:30:00
In this section, Danny Meyer, founder of Shake Shack, discusses the implementation of the Hospitality Included policy. He explains how it was challenging to include everything in the menu price, including increasing the starting manager salary, implementing a retirement plan, and a family leave policy, while also leaving some money for investors. Meyer also gives insight into how this policy resulted in a foregone million dollars in federal tax credits, as well as decreasing profits but allowed for better cooks and doing the right thing. Meyer also explains how COVID-19 impacted the policy, resulting in the resumption of tipping and the company paying a percentage of revenue every night to cooks who are not eligible for tips, as an effort to support employees.

01:35:00
In this section, Danny Meyer discusses how his restaurant Shake Shack transitioned from a tipping model to a hospitality included one, where servers make the same adjusted minimum wage and are not dependent on tips. To ensure that top performers could earn more, they created learning opportunities and tiers for servers to gain a higher base rate. However, while they factored in longevity, it did not factor into their schedule, so people had a work-life balance. Although they had grown up in a different culture, Meyer noted the value of high hospitality quotient employees in providing exceptional service, and noted that they could be happy even if they were not making the most money.

01:40:00
In this section, Danny Meyer explains the philosophy behind why they rate their employees on a scale of 100, with 51 points allocated to hospitality performance and 49 to technical performance. He notes that while the food better be good and technical performance has to be on point, what truly helps a restaurant to thrive is when guests feel like you are on their side. Meyer also recommends Seth Godin's book "This Is Marketing" as it perfectly encapsulates the fact that people want to feel like they belong somewhere, and great marketing doesn't just sell services or products but makes people feel like they belong to a tribe. Finally, Meyer shares a personal story of how Seth Godin broke his nose on the door to one of Meyer's restaurants, which exemplifies Godin's values of not just creating but living a certain lifestyle.

01:45:00
In this section, Danny Meyer, the founder of Shake Shack, suggests that assuming the best in people is crucial to forming successful relationships. Meyer encourages the idea of a "charitable assumption" when starting a conversation or interacting with people, as it can create an environment of hope and progress, rather than tribalism or division. Additionally, Meyer urges listeners to support their local restaurants and food industry, citing their importance in bringing communities together and providing a place for social and personal connections.

01:50:00
In this section, Tim Ferriss wraps up his conversation with Danny Meyer and thanks him for his time, highlighting that he has a lot to follow up on and think about because of their discussion. They briefly discuss the Shake Shack in Austin and the one-of-a-kind Lockhart Link burger that can only be found there. Danny's social media handles and USHG's website are shared, as well as Tim's closing message to be kind to others and ourselves.
