In this section, Tim Ferriss introduces two sponsors for the episode, Shopify and 8 Sleep. He provides a comprehensive overview of Shopify's platform, highlighting that anyone can use it for building an online store, accepting all payment methods, and accessing thousands of integrations and third-party apps. Tim also shares his personal experience with Shopify, from being an advisor to its founder in 2008 to watching its growth over the years. Additionally, Tim talks about 8 Sleep's temperature-adjusting sleeping device, the Pod cover, which provides optimal temperatures for quality sleep based on biometrics, environment, and sleep stages.

00:05:00
In this section, the background and accomplishments of Dr. Kelly Starrett are highlighted. He is the co-founder of The Ready State, formerly known as Mobility WOD, which began in 2008 and has transformed the field of performance therapy and self-care. He is known for his physical prowess, being 230 pounds of pure muscle with exceptional mobility and flexibility, and has clients from various professional sports, Olympic gold medalists, Tour de France cyclists, CrossFit Games medalists, professional ballet dancers, and elite military personnel. His latest book, co-written by his wife Juliet Starrett, is titled "Built to Move: The 10 Essential Habits to Help You Move Freely and Live Fully."

00:10:00
In this section, Kelly Starrett talks about ski touring and how indigenous populations used seal skins on the bottom of skis to go uphill. He explains the physics behind how the hair on the skins can catch in one direction, allowing skiers to slide their way up the mountain. Kelly and Tim also discuss their experience skiing in Northern Japan, the aches and pains they feel from exertion, and the benefits of soaking in hot springs and eating rice and meat. They shift to observations about Japan, including the custom of removing shoes upon entry to a hotel, which changes the way people move, leading to an interesting discussion on movement and mobility.

00:15:00
In this section, Kelly Starrett discusses the impact of the environment on our bodies, and how easily we can be shaped by it. He talks about how people in Japan have been doing things like sitting on the floor and using squat toilets their entire lives, while in the US, people struggle to sit on the ground for more than five minutes without discomfort. Starrett believes that the body tunes itself by sitting on the ground, which is something that we used to do all the time. However, due to the way our environment has changed, we have to go to functional fitness classes to remedy the fact that we're not doing things that people used to do naturally. He suggests modifying our environment or behavior to incorporate some of these older, more common practices.

00:20:00
In this section, Dr. Kelly Starrett discusses the importance of being able to sit and stand up without using your hands and why it is a great indicator of morbidity and mortality. He explains that this skill is a mid-range position that can be easily done by children or the elderly, who may not be in peak physical condition. However, the ability to do this indicates a person's ability to move freely, which is important for reducing the likelihood of injury and improving one's health span. Starrett notes that focusing on durability and getting the ABCs of movement can contribute to many different performance goals, whereas a one-trick pony approach may not necessarily offer the same benefits.

00:25:00
In this section, Dr. Kelly Starrett discusses the two key objective measurable repeatable ideas from his book "Becoming a Supple Leopard": native range of motion and biomotor output. He explains that every physician, physical therapist, and surgeon agrees that there are basic ranges for every human's shoulder movement, and that restoring range of motion while teaching high-performance movements can enhance one's potential for winning championships. Starrett also stresses the importance of Base Camp behaviors, which are the behaviors that create durable individuals independent of performance. Examples of such behaviors include sleep, walking, micronutrients, and enough protein, which are often overlooked even by world-class athletes. He also suggests tracking one's sleep and striving for eight hours or more to facilitate maximum adaptation and easier body healing.

00:30:00
In this section, Dr. Kelly Starrett emphasizes the importance of sleep, movement, and mobility for overall health and pain management. He stresses that improving one's sleep quality can help reduce pain sensitivity and increase the desire to move. As for movement, Starrett suggests increasing one's step count to about 6-8,000 steps a day, which can accumulate enough sleep pressure to help one fall asleep more easily. Additionally, he notes that walking has been found to improve tissue quality due to its impact on both the circulatory and lymphatic systems. Starrett encourages individuals to focus on these simple, base camp behaviors to improve their overall health and wellbeing.

00:35:00
In this section, Dr. Kelly Starrett discusses the importance of movement and decongestion in managing the waste products of our body. He talks about the lymphatic vessels being one-way valves that are buried into our musculature and explains how muscle contraction is responsible for moving the sewage through our body. He emphasizes the significance of movement in decongestion and recovering from injuries, adding that decongestion can help us adapt to exercise more effectively. Starrett advises against smashing ourselves without continuing to move and recommends standing desks, fidgeting, perching, and moving around more often as ways to keep the engine idling a little bit and adapt to the training stressors more effectively.

00:40:00
In this section, Dr. Kelly Starrett discusses the importance of balance for human movement and how it can be improved through foot pressure awareness. He talks about how young people may not appreciate the importance of balance, but it is crucial for everyday activities and performance hacks. He also shares his fear of lateral balance and his discovery of a portable slack line called the slack block that can be used to challenge balance in any setting, including the kitchen.

00:45:00
In this section, Dr. Kelly Starrett discusses how he uses skiing as a diagnostic tool for identifying asymmetries in his body. He also mentions the importance of foot strength and ankle range of motion in skiing and how it can improve one's reaction time when they get outside of their base of support. Starrett suggests standing on one foot with eyes closed for 20 seconds to measure this vital sign and also emphasizes the need to become aware of one's body and connect the dots between performance and controllable factors like movement and mobility.

00:50:00
In this section, Kelly Starrett, a movement expert and physiotherapist, discusses the concept of pushing your body’s limits and the importance of staying in your established comfort zone. He explains that the body will not allow you to exceed your comfort zone, no matter what your targets are; therefore, it is essential to spend time in the positions that people want to improve on. Starrett advises first strengthening movements at end-range instead of passively stretching more, as it allows the body to relax and accept that it will not be broken. This phenomenon is why he recommends spending more time sitting on the ground or in end-range positions, therefore creating a more intimate understanding of what our bodies are capable of.

00:55:00
In this section, Dr. Kelly Starrett and Tim Ferriss discuss how to improve balance and whether there is a minimum effective dose for doing so. They suggest starting by examining your day-to-day life for opportunities to challenge your balance, such as standing on one leg to put on a sock. They also note the efficacy of incorporating balance play into daily routines, citing that athletes who did so had stronger feet and better reaction times. They conclude by noting that many people overestimate their balance abilities until they are faced with challenging situations like slipping on ice or trying parkour.

01:00:00
In this section, Dr. Kelly Starrett discusses the importance of being able to put your arms over your head and the relationship between shoulder mobility and the neck and back. He suggests that a lack of shoulder mobility can lead to seemingly complex problems around neck pain. Dr. Starrett recommends simple exercises such as lifting a broomstick off the ground and highlighting the benefits of basic movement traditions like hanging, downward dog, and walking on hands. He emphasizes that it's not necessary to be perfect, but simply to have more mobility than the day before to improve the functionality of the neck-body system.

01:05:00
In this section of the interview, Dr. Kelly Starrett discusses the importance of restoring one's body to its native ranges of motion, which promotes better brain function and recruits additional musculature in the process.  Starrett emphasizes that while one may not be able to pinpoint whether shoulder pain will go away by improving one's ability to put their arms over their head, there are many benefits to increasing range of motion. Starrett recommends a regression technique that focuses on either a slower tempo or isometrics, such as doing an end range isometric control with the breath, which can be done by putting one's arms up on a wall and taking five breaths while feeling the positions they want to improve.

01:10:00
In this section, Dr. Kelly Starrett discusses the use of breath and respiratory resistance for improving movement and mobility. Using breath, particularly through frontal and back breathing, can help in getting motion in the upper back and improving global flexion. Starrett also mentions the use of the O2 trainer, a resistance device that aids in breathing exercises which has clinical data to support its effectiveness in reducing lower back pain. Additionally, Starrett highlights the importance of having movement options and using breath in different contexts, such as when carrying something or running away from danger.

01:15:00
In this section, Kelly Starrett talks about the importance of breathing mechanics and how it can help alleviate back pain and improve mobility. He explains that breathing is the first intervention for back pain as it can enhance movement system input and dissociate the diaphragm from the psoas. Additionally, he notes that breath can be used as a mobilization device and diagnostic tool, and that understanding the mechanics of breath can improve VO2 max, which is crucial in several sports. Starrett also emphasizes the importance of finding positions where it is possible to breathe more effectively and using this as a means of improving performance, whether that be through organizing your body better or pressing more effectively.

01:20:00
In this section, Dr. Kelly Starrett talks about the importance of protein and vegetable intake for the body's tissue recovery and health. Many people do not consume enough protein, and a reasonable amount is between 0.7 and 1 gram per pound body weight. Likewise, most people fail to eat a sufficient amount of fruits and vegetables, so Dr. Starrett suggests consuming 800 grams of them. These can be fresh, frozen, or cooked, and consuming them ensures the intake of crucial micronutrients, vitamins, minerals, and fiber, which are important for body recovery and health.

01:25:00
In this section, Dr. Kelly Starrett discusses the benefits of incorporating more fruits and vegetables into one's diet by aiming for at least 800 grams a day to achieve a healthier diet. Starrett explains that by focusing on getting more protein and fruits and vegetables, there's less room for unhealthy foods. Additionally, Starrett suggests using the Dirty Dozen list to selectively avoid certain plants with high pesticide exposure, making organic purchases when economically feasible. She encourages people to find the fruits and vegetables they enjoy, and experiment with diversity and different types to keep it fun. She also notes that beans are a great source of plant fiber and matter and advocates for their consumption.

01:30:00
In this section, Dr. Kelly Starrett talks about his eating habits and how it affects his health. Starrett emphasizes the importance of adding fruits and vegetables every meal and eating what is sustainable. He also shares his fear of soft tissue tweaks and how he uses loading tissues regularly and decongestion to avoid them. When Tim Ferris asks him about functional movement screens he performs, Starrett recommends loading the tissues first and then assessing the range of motion. He also stresses the importance of resistance training and movement training to slow down the effects of aging. Starrett suggests being active every day and never doing nothing to maintain a healthy body.

01:35:00
In this section, Dr. Kelly Starrett explains the importance of mastering the basic movement patterns, which he calls the "archetype." He believes that having a strong foundation in these patterns enables a person to understand any physical system, structure, or movement. With sufficient exposure to these patterns, a person can gradually progress in strength and durability, which is crucial to performing practical fitness activities like skiing up a mountain. He also stresses the importance of adding load to challenge the body in various ways, especially since fitness has become too focused on being overly strong and fit without practical application. Simple loading through methods like the timed up and go can be an excellent indicator of power and durability.

01:40:00
In this section, Dr. Kelly Starrett emphasizes the importance of challenging positions and shapes in fitness training. While gym culture has become obsessed with achieving huge bodies and strength, Starrett argues that this can limit movement ability and neglects the importance of cardiorespiratory demand and skilled movement competency. Instead, he suggests testing the veracity of one's training by being able to transfer skills across different exercise modalities. Starrett explains that training shapes will allow you the permission to engage in activities that you enjoy while also building competency in movement under different physical demands. He recommends squatting as a form of restoring back health and a test of hip range of motion and ankle range of motion, suggesting progressive overload for improved range of motion and flexibility.

01:45:00
In this section, Dr. Kelly Starrett discusses how cardiorespiratory fitness is not enough on its own as it has been over-quantified and overemphasized in recent years. While cardiorespiratory fitness is great for quickly and efficiently improving fitness, it does little to improve complex movement patterns that the body requires. He notes that frequently going to the gym for an hour and smashing oneself is not necessarily harmful, but it does little to promote the right amount of fitness to challenge the body's movement requirements. Furthermore, Starrett notes that compromised movement quality and capacity have led to compromised hip extension, one of the most critical and overlooked movements in modern society.

01:50:00
In this section, Kelly Starrett talks about the importance of capacity versus movement choice and how building extra capacity to the system can alleviate pain or difficulty with physical activity. He also emphasizes the importance of finding moments in the day to fit in key behaviors and the need for a better job of showing people where they have agency and control. The book, written in partnership with his CEO, is aimed at those who don't identify with exercising but want to become more durable and healthier.

01:55:00
In this section, Kelly Starrett and Tim Ferriss discuss the importance of movement for everyone, particularly those who have not been served well by the fitness community. They emphasize the need for a simple starting point for those who are overwhelmed by the vast amount of fitness options, and stress that movement is an essential component of a healthy life, much like the importance of consuming a varied diet. Starrett and Ferriss also touch on the concept of vital signs and self-assessment to help people identify their blind spots and areas for growth, with Starrett promoting his book, "Built to Move," as a comprehensive guide to these concepts.

02:00:00
In this section, Tim Ferriss and Kelly Starrett wrap up their conversation with some final advice for listeners. Starrett emphasizes the importance of consistency and reminds people that it takes time to make changes in the body. He also encourages people to bring someone else along on their fitness journey and start with small steps like taking a post-dinner walk with a family member. Ferriss also mentions his "Five Bullet Friday" newsletter where he shares his favorite things and notes that eight sleep, a temperature-regulating mattress cover, is sponsoring the episode.

02:05:00
In this section, the podcast host talks about the sponsor of the episode, Shopify. He describes it as a platform that helps entrepreneurs sell anything anywhere, and the tools that were only enjoyed by big businesses are now available to small business owners thanks to Shopify. The host goes on to discuss that Shopify has thousands of integrations with third-party apps, which lets you manage online sales, allows you to use all major payment methods, and helps drive sales. In addition, he mentions that Shopify offers extensive resources to help new entrepreneurs succeed, including 24/7 support to not feel alone in a challenging journey. Finally, he encourages the listeners to check out the Shopify site with a one-dollar per month trial period offer.
