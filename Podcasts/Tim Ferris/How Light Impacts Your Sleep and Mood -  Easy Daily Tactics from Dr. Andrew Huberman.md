Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses how light impacts your sleep and mood, outlining how it properly aligns your body for sleep and how it is the most powerful Zeitgeber. He recommends turning on as many overhead lights as possible in the morning and throughout the day, avoiding bright lights in the evening, and eating early in the day to help establish a basal state. He also recommends interacting with people early in the day or with your dog to create wake-up signals.

The light viewing behavior has perhaps the strongest effect on our levels of alertness and our capacity to fall asleep and get a good night's sleep. This is because at the fundamental layer of our biology, every cell in our body needs information about time of day. This is why we have a collection of neurons over the roof of our mouth, the so-called "suprachiasmatic nucleus," that's our central circadian clock. It informs every cell in our body about time of day, but it is deep in our brain and has no access to light. So, there are a collection of neurons in the eye, the so-called "melanopsin ganglion cells," that remember of course that the eye is actually part of the brain. Those neurons communicate to the central clock when it's daytime and when it's night. So, the simple behavior that I believe everyone should adopt, including many blind people, is to view ideally sunlight for two to ten minutes every morning upon waking. When you get up in the morning, you really want to get bright light into your eyes because it does two things: First of all, it triggers the timed release of cortisol, a healthy level of cortisol into your system, which acts as a wake-up
