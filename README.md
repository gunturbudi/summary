# YouTube Summary Collection

This GitHub project is a collection of summarized content from popular YouTube channels and other content that I personally enjoy. The goal of this project is to provide concise summaries of the videos, making it easier for users to quickly grasp the main ideas without having to watch the entire video.

## Credits

The summarization for this project was made using [summarize.tech](https://www.summarize.tech/). All credits for the summarization process go to them.

Feel free to clone or explore the summaries! Happy reading!

## Summary Files

All the summaries are saved in Markdown (.md) files. You can directly read them on this GitHub repository. However, if you prefer to save the summaries locally or on your mobile phone, you can use a Markdown reader application.

One of my favourite is Obsidian, which is available for both desktop and mobile devices.
