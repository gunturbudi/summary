In this section, Dr. Omar Suleiman discusses the natural way of dhikr in Jannah. He explains that in Jannah, people will naturally glorify Allah and remember Him constantly, just as they breathe. This is because the hearts will be filled with love and illumination of Allah's knowledge, inspiring a love for Allah. Dhikr in Jannah is a pleasure, not a requirement, and is a response to the amazing things Allah has given. People's alhamdulillah in Jannah will be attached to specific things they are grateful for, such as the absence of sadness, guidance, keeping up with principles, and fulfilling the promise of Jannah. People will say subhanallah and alhamdulillah a lot, and give reasons why they are saying it. It is significant that the last person leaving hellfire says alhamdulillah for being saved from it.
