In the first episode of the #JannahSeries with Dr. Omar Suleiman, the Prophet Muhammad's vision of Paradise is discussed. The Prophet saw a vision of Paradise filled with all sorts of hardships, making it difficult to enter, but with pleasures beyond imagination. He reminds us that Jannah is near, but we need to step into it spiritually, and the Gates may shut forever. While both Jannah and Hellfire are eagerly waiting to receive the believers, Jannah is beautifully preparing for and looking forward to receiving those who strive for it. Ramadan has its gates flung open wider every night, and its beauty increases. Therefore, striving for Jannah should be the ultimate goal of every believer.
