In this section, Dr. Omar Suleiman discusses how everything we know about Jannah is just enough to make us long for it, but there is still so much more that Allah has not told us about. This is exemplified in a Hadith in which the angels tell Allah that the believers are asking for Jannah, and Allah asks them if they have seen it. When they say no, Allah tells them that if they were to see it, they would be even more eager for it. This shows the degree of love and talab we have for Jannah, even though we have never seen it. Additionally, there are names of Allah and degrees of Jannah that we haven't heard about yet, just like how there are 99 parts of Allah's mercy that we don't know about. The point is to seek forgiveness and do our best to fulfill our covenants with Allah.
