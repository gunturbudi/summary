In this section, Dr. Omar Suleiman discusses the concept of unclaimed property in Jannah. Believers have homes in both Jannah and Hellfire, and once they possess their home in Jannah, their home in Hellfire is demolished. However, the homes of those who go to Hellfire remain unclaimed and are inherited by the believers. Allah rewards the believers by granting them the share of those who rejected the call of Allah, including their palaces, gardens, and all the rewards they missed out on. The rewards given to the believers are not just due to their belief, but also because of their actions in this world. When believers see the rewards they have earned in Jannah, they feel a sense of accomplishment for what they achieved on earth, and Allah reminds them that they earned it through their actions.
