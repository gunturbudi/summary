In this section, it is mentioned that those who are mindful of their Lord will enter the garden and approach the Gate of it where they find a tree and two streams flowing out. They drink from each stream, cleansing both their insides and outsides and obtaining a radiance that is Jannah like. Then, they reach the keepers of paradise who welcome them with peace and allow them to enter Jannah forever. The purpose of the angel who guides them is just to make them feel more welcomed as they will already know their home in Paradise and be familiar with everything inside. It is emphasized that peace is essential to enter Jannah, and we can achieve it by spreading peace in this world.

The main prize Allah gives the believers in Jannah is his eternal pleasure, and the most special homes belong to those who responded to severe trials with exemplary patience.
