Sure, here's another one: The video discusses the discovery of a palace inscribed with the name of Pharaoh Ramses II, who is believed to be the very Pharaoh mentioned in the story of Prophet Moses in the Quran. The inscriptions on the palace walls depict scenes from the story of Prophet Moses, including the crossing of the Red Sea and the punishment of Pharaoh and his army. The video argues that this discovery provides archaeological evidence that supports the historical accuracy of the Quranic account of Prophet Moses and Pharaoh. Additionally, the video emphasizes that not only does the Quran provide accurate historical information, but it also contains moral and spiritual lessons that are still relevant today.

In this section, the video discusses four miracles that have come to light through the development of archaeology, historiography, and research related to the story of Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) and Pharaoh. One of these miracles is related to a man named Haman, a person in charge of construction, who is mentioned in the Quran and the Torah. The video explains that the Quran provides historical information about Haman, indicating that it is the word of Allah and that it is not taken from the Bible or the Torah. The video also highlights the Rosetta Stone, which played an important role in deciphering the hieroglyphs of Egypt and helped researchers find evidence of Haman's historical existence.

In this section, historical sources and archaeological discoveries were used to prove the accuracy of the Quranic story of Prophet Moses and Pharaoh. The Quranic verses describing the punishments inflicted upon Pharaoh and his people were found to match a historical document, a Papyrus, which detailed droughts, crop destruction, floods, diseases, and plunders that occurred within a short time frame. This document revealed the truth of the prophethood of Moses and the accuracy of the Quranic verses. Another historical discovery confirms that Pharaoh drowned, as stated in the Quran, and a letter from an official in the palace is exhibited at the British Museum in England detailing his death.

In this section, the video highlights how the Quran's account of Pharaoh, his death, and the preservation of his body without decay for thousands of years have been verified by archaeologists. The video shows that Pharaoh's body was found in Egypt's Valley of Kings, and it confirms the Quran's prophecy that his body would be shown to people in the future. The video also emphasizes that the Quran's choice of words regarding Pharaoh and Egyptian history is unlike that in the Bible and Torah, showing that even the Quran's vocabulary and language are considered as a miracle. Moreover, through the details of the period it depicts in its text, the Quran shows that Allah Almighy knows everything that has been known or hidden in history, and when appropriate, he proves it with examples like Pharaohs.
