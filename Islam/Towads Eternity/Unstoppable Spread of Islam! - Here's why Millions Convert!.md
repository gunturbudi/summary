The key reasons highlighted include the influence of the Prophet Muhammad, the logical reasoning and solutions provided by the religion, the sense of community and brotherhood, and the emphasis on good morals and behavior. Islam provides clear answers to life's questions and is backed by volumes of books addressing fundamental issues. It has also closed the financial gap between people with zakat and charity, while modern culture creates a huge gap between the poor and the rich with the interest system. Additionally, Islam addresses all areas of life, including legal issues, knowledge, science, reasoning, economy, State Administration and diplomacy, marriage and family affairs, hospitality, being a good neighbor, and taking care of the orphan.

In this section, the transcript highlights the reasons why Islam is the most rapidly spreading religion in the world despite being heavily criticized and defamed by the media. The four main factors mentioned include the influence of the prophet Muhammad and his unwavering commitment to Islam, the importance of seeking answers and finding logical reasoning within the religion, the sense of community and brotherhood, and the emphasis on good morals and behavior. By examining the life of the Prophet, studying the Quran, and finding a sense of belonging within the Muslim community, many people are attracted to the religion. Despite being subjected to persecution and insults, Islam continues to attract many new followers, and it is considered that it may become the largest religion in the world.

In this section, the video explains why Islam is exceptional and can provide clear answers to life's questions. The religion is backed by volumes of books that address fundamental issues in the belief system and encourages people to use logic and learn knowledge science. Islam is proven by dozens of evidence, unlike other belief systems that contain logical fallacies and errors. Additionally, 1400 years ago, it brought definite solutions to the problems still not solved today. For instance, it advocated for unity and brotherhood among people and introduced the Zakat, which served as a bridge between the rich and the poor and strengthened the bond of brotherhood. These solutions show how Islam is the most logical religion with reasonable explanations and provides an alternative to issues that have plagued humanity for centuries.

In this section, it is explained that Islam has closed the financial gap between people with zakat and charity, whereas modern culture creates a huge gap between the poor and the rich with the interest system. Factor 4 is another fundamental point that attracts the attention of Muslim converts, which is that Islam doesn't stay within the walls of the place of worship, rather it addresses all areas of life. Lessons and recommendations on dozens of issues are found in the Quran and the prophet's own words that preserve their freshness, are still used and needed for 1400 years. All legal issues with enough details to run a state, knowledge, science, and reasoning, economy, State Administration and diplomacy, marriage and family affairs, hospitality, being a good neighbor, taking care of the orphan, are some of the examples where Muhammad taught people during the 600s. The prophet also showed examples of them by practicing them. The famous historian and astrophysicist Michael Hart put the prophet Muhammed in the first place in his book The Hundred which ranks the most influential persons in history.
