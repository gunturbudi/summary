In this section, Steve Isnaoki, a Japanese imam, shares his experience of becoming Muslim and the reactions he received from his family and friends. He talks about how he woke up at the age of 13-14 and began asking the fundamental questions of life. He tried to find answers through Buddhism but eventually gave up. He met an Egyptian family while he was exchange student in Melbourne, Australia, and that's when his biased view of Islam began to melt away. He talks about how after embracing Islam, he was worried about how he would be viewed by society in Japan, but watching the film about Malcolm X and seeing the scenery of Hajj encouraged him to take the final step. While his parents did not have an issue with him converting in the beginning, the social issues that followed due to a cult named Om, which gave a negative and bad image of having a particular religion, led to misunderstandings.

In this section, the Japanese imam shares the story of how his father disowned him when he decided to study abroad in Kuwait to learn Arabic and about Islam. His father asked him to quit being a Muslim and when the imam refused, his father told him that he is not his son anymore. The imam found a way to continue his studies with the help of an Egyptian imam's recommendation letter to the Egyptian embassy, but sadly, his father did not embrace Islam before passing away. The imam also explains how he found contradictions in Buddhism that stopped him from becoming a monk. He highlights the difficult situation for Japanese people interested in learning about Islam, as some books written by people who want to spread hatred against Islam are best sellers in Japan. The imam's greatest hardship as a Muslim in Japan is the lack of helping hands from the community.
