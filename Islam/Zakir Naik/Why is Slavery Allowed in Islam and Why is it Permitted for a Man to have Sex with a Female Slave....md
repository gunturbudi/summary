# Summary of Why is Slavery Allowed in Islam and Why is it Permitted for a Man to have Sex with a Female Slave...

The speaker in the video discusses why the Quran allows men to have sex with female slaves without being married to them. He explains that this practice was prevalent during wars when captives were taken and became slaves.

The speaker defends Islam's stance on this issue, citing that the Quran encourages freeing slaves and marrying them or giving them their freedom as a form of Maher. He further argues that Islamic laws are far superior to the treatment of prisoners of war in Guantanamo Bay and how slaves were treated in the past.
