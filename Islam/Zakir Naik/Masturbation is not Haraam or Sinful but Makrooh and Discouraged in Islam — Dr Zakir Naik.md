Dr. Zakir Naik discusses the varying opinions of Islamic scholars on the permissibility of masturbation in Islam. While the majority say it is haram (forbidden), a significant number say it is makrooh (discouraged) or mubah (optional). The scholars who believe it is makrooh see guarding one's private parts as only pertaining to sexual intercourse within marriage. Dr. Naik explains that while normal masturbation is not harmful, it can lead to haram activities such as watching pornography. He suggests fasting as an alternative and warns against letting guilt lead to mental stress. Ultimately, he maintains that there is no evidence in the Quran or hadith to support the idea that masturbation results in punishment.

In this section, Dr. Zakir Naik discusses the different viewpoints of scholars regarding the permissibility of masturbation in Islam. The first group of scholars believe that masturbation is haram based on the hadith that encourages young people to get married or fast instead, without explicitly mentioning masturbation. However, the second group of scholars see the guarding of one's private parts as only pertaining to sexual intercourse with one's spouse, meaning that masturbation is not included. Additionally, Ibn Hasan notes that the Prophet permitted touching one's private part and emitting fluid. Therefore, the second group of scholars argue that if one can enjoy sexual pleasure with their spouse, then self-stimulation should also be permissible.
