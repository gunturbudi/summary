In this section, Dr Zakir Naik discusses the Christian claim that Jesus is God and provides evidence from the Bible to refute this claim. While Islam believes in Jesus as a messenger of Allah and the Messiah, Christians often claim that Jesus claimed divinity. Dr Naik points out that there is no unequivocal statement in the Bible where Jesus himself claims to be God or instructs others to worship him. In fact, Jesus acknowledges that God is greater than him and that he seeks to do the will of the Father. Therefore, Dr Naik argues that Jesus never claimed divinity and was one of the mightiest messengers of Allah.
