# Summary of Pooja Asks Dr Zakir, “Qur’an  is Corrupted as it says Sperm is Produced between Backbones”

A sister asks Dr. Zakir Naik about the Quran stating that sperm is produced between the backbones, which she thinks is not possible. However, Dr. Naik explains that this scientific fact from over 1,400 years ago is proven by modern science. The reproductive organs originate from a space between the backbone and the 11th and 12th rib in the male fetus, and they still receive blood supply from there in adulthood. This is just one of many proofs that the Quran has no scientific mistakes and is a message from the Almighty.
