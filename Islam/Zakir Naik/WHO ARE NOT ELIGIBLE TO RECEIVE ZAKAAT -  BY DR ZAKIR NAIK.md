In this section of the video, Dr. Zakir Naik discusses the different categories of people who are not eligible to receive zakat. While there are certain groups of people who are not eligible under general rules, there are also people within the eight categories of those who can receive zakat who may not be eligible. The first group includes descendants of Prophet Muhammad's family, as it may create an issue of people alleging that the Prophet is taking zakat. The second group includes non-Muslims, as it is compulsory to only give zakat to Muslims. The third group includes the rich and able-bodied who should not be given zakat unless they are unable to earn enough to fulfill their basic needs. The fourth group includes those who are dependent on others, such as children, wives, or parents, as it is not permissible to give zakat to dependents.
