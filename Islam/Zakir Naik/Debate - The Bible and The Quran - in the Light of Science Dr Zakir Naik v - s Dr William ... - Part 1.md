Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
This video features a debate between two prominent Islamic scholars: Dr. Zakir Naik (representing the Islamic Circle of North America) and Dr. William Campbell (representing the Islamic Research Foundation). The debate is focused on the Bible and the Quran, with particular emphasis on their scientific accuracy. Dr. Naik and Dr. Campbell share their own personal beliefs and perspectives on the matter, and the audience is requested to maintain an open mind in order to have a fruitful dialogue.

00:05:00
In this video, two scholars discuss the meanings of words in the Bible and the Quran. The context of all the usages in each text is also considered. There is no ambiguity in the Quran when it comes to prohibiting the consumption of pork, as Allah states plainly in the Quran: "Can't eat pigs." Conversely, there are many different meanings to "pig" in the Bible, depending on the context.

00:10:00
The Quran discusses embryology in a similar way to modern science, describing different stages of development. The words "alaka" (clot, leech), "mudaga" (drop of blood), "adam" (man), "bones", "muscles", and "klot" (lump) are all used to describe the process of creation.

00:15:00
In this video, two prominent scientists debate the accuracy of the Qur'an in regards to reproduction. Dr. Zakir Naik points out that there is no indication in the Qur'an that bones are first formed and then covered in flesh. Dr. William Sadler agrees and adds that the Qur'an is in error when it states that the chewed meat becomes bones and then muscles.

00:20:00
Dr Zakir Naik and Dr. William Moore debate the Qur'an and Bible's descriptions of human development, with Moore asserting that a 23-30 day embryo is stage 10 in development and Naik countering that a leech-like appearance and open-backed development suggest a 23-30 day embryo is not a stage 10 embryo at all. Naik also points to Hippocrates, born in 460 BC, to support his argument that the Qur'an's descriptions of human development are clear and stable.

00:25:00
In this video, Dr Zakir Naik debates Dr. William Lane Craig on the compatibility of the Bible and the Quran. Dr. Naik argues that both the Bible and the Quran follow the same scientific stages of embryology, which include the formation of semen, the clotting of menstrual blood, the formation of bones, and the growth of flesh. Indian medicine also agrees with Galen's teachings on the stages of embryology, with the fetus developing from a mixture of semen and menstrual blood.

00:30:00
The video discusses the history of medicine and how the Galenic theories of Aristotle, Hippocrates, and Galen were available to Muhammad and the people around him. It also discusses the establishment of a new medical school in Alexandria using Galen's 16 books as its texts.

00:35:00
This video discusses the ancient Greek physicians Hippocrates and Galen and how their embryological ideas were used to explain the Quran. Ibnucina is also mentioned as a scientific and philosophical authority for the pre-modern Europeans. Kayim al-Jawiya and Kaim took full advantage of the agreement between Quran and Greek medicine.

00:40:00
In this debate, Dr Zakir Naik argues that the Quran accurately describes various stages of embryonic development, in agreement with Greco-Roman medical knowledge. Dr. William Moore points out that this knowledge was not common at the time the Quran was written, and that the use of different words reflects the fact that the sun is a source of light while the moon only reflects light. Shabir Ali and Dr. Zakir Naik both argue that the Quran is God's word.

00:45:00
In this video, Dr. Zakir Naik and Dr. William Lane Craig debate the concept of light in the Quran. Dr. Naik points out that the light of the moon is not its own light, but is a reflected light of the sun. He also mentions that the phrase "Kitab al-munir" (a book of enlightenment) is used to indicate a book that is radiating the light of knowledge. Dr. Craig argues that the Quran mentions light in Siraj (a chapter in the Noah story) and in other verses, and that Muhammad is the lamp spreading light. Dr. Naik concludes the discussion by saying that linguistically and spiritually, Siraj and the adjective munir are used together for the same meaning.

00:50:00
In this video, two scientists debate the accuracy of the Bible and the Quran. Dr. Zakir Naik points out that the Arabic words "noor" and "munir" mean "shining" or "reflected light," and Muhammad is not like the sun or Allah, who is like the moon. Dr. William Lane Craig responds that the Bible mentions mountains being placed on the earth to prevent it from shaking, which confirms that the authors knew about the water cycle. Amos 9:1-3, 36:26-28, 21:31, and 16:15 all mention mountains being placed on the earth to prevent it from shaking.

00:55:00
The mountains were thrown down like tent pegs to keep a tent in place, like an anchor to hold a ship in place, or to stop the earth from moving. However, modern geologists describe the forming of mountains as causing earthquakes. Therefore, these verses present a definite problem. Dr Maurice Bukai recognized this and discussed the verses in his book, The Bible, the Quran, and Science.

01:00:00
The video discusses various verses from the Quran and the Bible, discussing how they may be interpreted in light of modern science. It discusses how mountains were formed, the sun does not set in a spring of murky water, and communities are not connected to milk or feces.

01:05:00
The speaker, Dr. William Campbell, introduces Dr. Zakir Naik, a medical doctor who has become known for his lectures on Islam and comparative religion. Naik clarifies islamic viewpoints based upon the Quran, hadith, and other religious scriptures. He is popular for his critical analysis and convincing answers to challenging questions posed by audiences.

01:10:00
The speaker discusses the compatibility and conflict between the Quran and modern science. He points out that while a person may use a concordis or conflicting approach, as long as they are logical and provide a logical explanation for their position, they will not be able to prove a single verse of the Quran in conflict with modern science.

01:15:00
The Quran describes the water cycle in great detail, mentioning stages one, two, and three. Dr. Zakir Naik argues that the Quran is more accurate than the Bible in its description of the water cycle.

01:20:00
In this debate, Dr. Zakir Naik takes on Dr. William Campbell regarding the Bible and the Quran's claims regarding the Earth's geography. Dr. Campbell argues that the Quran correctly describes the Earth's radius and that mountains play a crucial role in preventing earthquakes. Dr. Naik counters that the Quran does not mention earthquakes at all, and that the mountain mentioned in the Quran actually refers to a stake in the ground.

01:25:00
In this debate, Zakir Naik argues that the Bible and Quran are in agreement with scientific fact, while Dr. William Campbell disputes this claim, writing that some verses in the Quran may be incorrect. Naik also discusses the concept of barzak, or the unseen barrier between salt and sweet water, which has been observed by scientists.

01:30:00
While there are many interpretations of the Bible and Quran, Dr. Zakir Naik argues that because they were written at different times, the meanings of the words used have changed. Naik also states that the Quran was meant for all of humanity, and Prophet Muhammad was not only meant for the Muslims.

01:35:00
In this YouTube video, Dr. Zakir Naik debates Dr. William Campbell about the differences between the Quran and the Bible in regards to embryology. Dr. Naik points out that the Quran accurately describes the stages of embryology in great detail, while Dr. Campbell argues that the Quran has scientific errors. This debate is relevant to Muslims and non-Muslims alike, as it demonstrates the accuracy of the Quran in comparison to other religious texts.

01:40:00
In the first part of this debate, Dr. Zakir Naik and Dr. William Campbell debate the stages of development of the embryo, with Dr. Naik arguing that the Quran is more accurate in describing these stages than the Bible. In the second part, Dr. Naik explains that the Quran refers to certain pain receptors in the skin that are responsible for feeling pain, which is in line with modern embryology. He concludes the talk by emphasizing that the Quran is the true revelation from God, and that even after 1000 signs are given, some people will still not accept it.

01:45:00
The presenter argues that the Bible contains scientific errors, and that it cannot be attributed to God. He also points out that the purpose of his presentation is not to hurt anyone's feelings, but to point out that a divine revelation cannot contain scientific errors.

01:50:00
Dr. Zakir Naik debates Dr. William Campbell on the accuracy of the Bible and Quran. Naik points out that there are many scientific errors in the Bible, and if Campbell cannot understand the Quran, that does not mean the Quran is wrong. Campbell replies that the King James and International versions of the Bible are accurate, and that Naik is wrong to say Indians out here do not drink milk. Naik challenges Campbell to attempt the falsification test of the Bible, and Campbell does not respond.

01:55:00
In this video, Dr Zakir Naik debates Dr William Campbell on the scientific accuracy of the Bible. Naik points out that there are many inconsistencies in Genesis, and therefore the Bible is not from God. Campbell conceded that there are errors in the Bible, but argues that these errors do not disprove its authenticity. In the end, both men agree that the Quran is a superior source of information, and therefore believers should accept it over the Bible.
