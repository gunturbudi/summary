# Summary of Is it Permitted to Drink Non Alcoholic Beer? - Dr Zakir Naik

Dr. Zakir Naik addresses the question of whether non-alcoholic beer is permitted in Islam. He explains that although non-alcoholic beer does not list alcohol as an ingredient, it is made the same way as regular beer, with alcohol extracted using various methods. However, these extraction methods do not fully remove all of the alcohol, so non-alcoholic beer typically contains 0.5% or less alcohol.  Dr. Naik emphasizes that this small amount of alcohol still makes the drink prohibited in Islam. He cites a Hadith in which the Prophet Muhammad instructed that even if the alcohol is extracted, the original presence of alcohol means that it is prohibited.  Therefore, he concludes that non-alcoholic beer is not permitted for Muslims to consume and suggests that it should be prohibited in Muslim majority countries.
