The Prophet himself had stated that whoever sends blessings upon him will be given 10 rewards. The Prophet cared deeply for his ummah and wanted them to have a light burden, hence the need to show love for him through reciting shalawat. It is important to take advantage of Ramadan, a month of special blessings and opportunities, in order to seek forgiveness and to gain closeness with Allah. Those who neglect the opportunities that Ramadan presents will face regret and may not receive the forgiveness they seek.
