In this section, the speaker explains that all actions connecting humans to Allah are considered dzikir, such as reading the Quran and performing Salah. Prayer is an interaction with Allah, while reciting the Quran brings people closer to Allah, which is referred to as "zikir." Dua is also considered dzikir because one is connected to Allah while making supplications. People can also add prayers at other times besides during Salah, and there are no restrictions on making prayers in Salah, even outside of the formal prayers. Additionally, the speaker explains that there are many prayers taught by the Prophet, and praying is part of dzikir, with istighfar being the first step, followed by other prayers, such as Salam and Quranic verses, which can be practiced formally or informally.
