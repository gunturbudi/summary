In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the importance of strengthening our belief in Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala. He emphasizes that it is essential to have a strong faith that is firmly rooted in our hearts and can stay with us until the end of our lives. This faith is referred to as Aqidah and is comprised of three essential elements: Iman, Aqidah, and Amal. He also touches on the five pillars of Islam, the six key components of faith, and the importance of knowing Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala to strengthen our belief in Him. Finally, he talks about the significance of Surah Al-Ikhlas, which was revealed as a response to those who questioned the name of Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the importance of the name Rabb or Rubb in the Islamic faith. This name is used to describe Allah's attribute of rububiyah, or His role as the sustainer and maintainer of the universe. By using this name, Muslims are able to connect with Allah and seek His help and mercy. The name Rabb also distinguishes Allah from other false idols that were worshipped by the people of Mecca during the time of the Prophet Muhammad. Overall, the name Rabb is a powerful symbol of the Islamic faith and its connection to Allah's rububiyah.

00:10:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the essence of the soul and the importance of having a strong belief in Allah. He emphasizes that having true faith in Allah is not just a label but an identity that is intrinsic to one's soul. The Quran states that true believers are those who have a strong faith and are constantly remembering Allah. Ustadz Adi Hidayat also highlights the significance of the name of Allah and how it is capable of shaking one's soul if mentioned continuously. He explains that the first pillar of faith is to have knowledge and recognition of Allah, and it is crucial to focus on Allah and dissociate from any other divinities that are worshipped besides Allah.

00:15:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the importance of having a strong foundation in one's belief in Allah. He explains that the expression of one's faith depends on the strength of the foundation, and if it is weak, it can lead to problematic actions and behaviors. He also delves into the prevalence of idol worship during the time of the Prophet Muhammad, with some people worshipping multiple gods made of materials such as stone and wood. However, the Surah Al-Ikhlas was revealed to emphasize the oneness of Allah and reject the worship of idols or any other gods. eventually, Allah left no room for doubt or excuses and emphasized that seeking guidance and the right path is solely the responsibility of the individual.

00:20:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the importance of seeking knowledge to find the true nature of Allah and avoid being misled by personal biases. He cautions against using personal desires to define the nature of Allah, stressing the need to follow rational standards established in Islamic teachings. This involves avoiding logical fallacies and contradictions in one's arguments and statements, which can distort the understanding of Allah and lead to a lack of objective truth. Instead, one must rely on Islamic teachings, such as the Quran, to gain knowledge and a deeper understanding of the truth. By doing so, they can find guidance and a moral compass to navigate the complexities of life.

00:25:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the importance of having a standard for determining the nature of God. The attributes of Rububiyah, which show God's greatness, forgiveness, and ability to provide and heal, among others, demonstrate Allah's role as the true God that must be revered. To establish this, Allah has explained his true nature and emphasized that there is no other God but him, and his attributes of Ahad must be upheld. The attributes of God must be entirely different from those of creation. Ustadz Adi Hidayat explains that the Quran emphasizes that Allah is the creator and caretaker of the universe, and everything that relates to His divine attributes must be entirely different from anything that is not Allah.

00:30:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the concept of God's Oneness, or Ahad, which means that Allah does not have a partner or equal in His attributes. He explains that everything in creation is paired, from humans to animals to plants, except for Allah who stands alone as the One and only Creator. This standard of Oneness creates a clear and rational understanding of the difference between the Creator and the creation, which is necessary to avoid the potential for worship of anything other than Allah.

00:35:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the concept of "Ahad" in Muslim belief, which means that God is one and cannot be paired with any other beings. He uses rational and logical arguments derived from Quranic verses to support this concept. According to Ustadz Adi Hidayat, the Quran states that God is not only the creator but also the caretaker of the universe, implying that there is only one supreme being who is in control of everything. He concludes that it is essential for Muslims to recognize God's oneness and to use rational arguments to explain this concept to non-believers.

00:40:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the logical proof of the oneness of Allah. He explains that since Allah is the Creator and Sustainer of the universe, it is impossible for there to be multiple gods responsible for creation and maintenance. This would lead to confusion and instability in the universe, as different gods may have conflicting interests and intentions. Furthermore, Allah's oneness is unique to Islam, as the term "Allah" is specifically mentioned in the Quran and cannot be modified into the names of other gods.

00:45:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the dangers of attributing human-like characteristics to God, as it could potentially lead to the belief that a creature can become God. This could create issues in the management of the universe and cause confusion about the hierarchy of power among multiple supposed deities. However, the concept of tawhid solves this issue by emphasizing that Allah is unique and singular, with no comparison or equal. Therefore, the name Allah cannot be imitated or replicated, and the practice of zikir must be guided by proper knowledge and understanding.

00:50:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the concept of Ketuhanan Allah or the divinity of Allah. He explains that Allah's divinity is not visible in our dimension of life but is believed through faith and is referred to as Iman. He adds that Allah's divinity is a sign that leads people towards Allah, as every time we come in contact with the Quran, we get closer to Allah, and our faith strengthens. He also talks about the significance of the name Allah and how it cannot be compared to any other name and stresses the importance of recognizing the fitrah or the natural inclination to return to Allah.

00:55:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the concept of seeking help and making requests from Allah. He emphasizes the importance of focusing on the one true God and not relying on other sources or objects as a medium to reach Him. He also explains that the concept of "as-Samad" encompasses many meanings that are all related to Allah being the ultimate source of power, knowledge, and ability to respond to the requests of His believers. The speaker warns against the danger of idolatry and asserts that only Allah can be the true object of our worship and our requests.

01:00:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the argumentation of the Quran about the concept of God. He explains that a statue's maker is weaker than the statue itself. Therefore, the logic of worshiping the statue doesn't make sense. Ustadz Adi Hidayat also underlines that God must have the characteristic of Somad, which means being the center of attention in requesting and worshiping, and being able to respond to the requests of worshipers. Moreover, that God must not have a resemblance with mortal beings.

01:05:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the attributes of God and how they cannot be the same as those of created beings. This argument is made in response to the idea that if a creature can give birth, then God should also be able to give birth. However, giving birth is not a part of the attributes of God because it goes against the nature of divinity. The power of God is shown through the miracles given to the prophets to establish their prophethood, such as Moses's staff, Jesus's healing, and Isa Alaihissalam's ability to raise the dead. These miracles were intended to strengthen belief in God's existence and power, not to claim divinity.

01:10:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the logic behind the argument that Isa cannot be God simply because he was born from a mother and was not conceived in the traditional sense. Instead, Hidayat proposes that just like the creation of Adam, Isa's creation was also a miracle from Allah. He argues that if people worship Isa solely because of his miraculous birth, then by that same logic, they should worship Adam, who was born without a father or mother. Hidayat also discusses the story of Ibrahim and how he was able to bring the dead to life with Allah's help, highlighting that the power of life and death ultimately lies with Allah and not with any earthly creature.

01:15:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the importance of having a clear understanding of the concept of Ketuhanan (the divine), particularly in terms of monotheism. He argues that the nature of Ketuhanan is such that God cannot be the product of birth or beget offspring, as this would complicate and confuse the concept of divinity. The aspect of Ketuhanan is central to religious diversity, and it is necessary to have a clear and unambiguous understanding of it to avoid confusion and ambiguity. This understanding should be built on strong and rational logic, supported by knowledge and information, including the wisdom and guidance of the heart and the soul, which can help to clarify and strengthen one's faith in Allah.

01:20:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat explains the importance of understanding the law of Allah and how it does not contradict rationality driven by true knowledge. He emphasizes that religion is not conflicting with rationality but is in fact based on it. He stresses that by using logic, true knowledge is acquired, and it will lead to the understanding of the essence of Allah and His greatness, making it easier to worship Him correctly. To do this, Allah has provided us with His divine law and guidance through His words that are explained through the Quranic verses. He highlights that the first lesson in Islam is understanding the existence of Allah, which serves as a foundation for Tawheed.

01:25:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat emphasizes the importance of finding common ground among different schools of thought in order to gain a deep understanding of fundamental beliefs. While there may be differences in teaching methods based on the time and context of different scholars, the underlying principles must remain the same. With regards to the practice of religion, there may be differences in expression and interpretation, but as long as the foundational principles are strong and consistent, there is room for flexibility and variation. Furthermore, Ustadz Adi Hidayat emphasizes the importance of self-improvement and not falling into the trap of criticizing others. By focusing on strengthening our own beliefs and understanding, we can better understand Allah and his perfect attributes.

01:30:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses how to interact with Allah after gaining knowledge of His existence and attributes. He suggests that learning the Asmaul Husna, the beautiful names of Allah, is a way to interact with Him and show humility. Ustadz Adi also mentions the importance of recognizing Allah's greatness through observing the universe and its signs, which can lead to the highest level of faith. He emphasizes that there are different levels of knowledge and faith, and we should strive to deepen our understanding of Allah and our relationship with Him.
