In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the practice of closing Ramadan and the significance of the end of this holy month. According to Alquran surah Kedua al-Baqarah, ayat 185, the closing of Ramadan is marked with a sense of happiness and gratitude towards Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala. The act of fasting during Ramadan is meant to train oneself to become a better and more righteous person, and the end of the month is meant to be a time of celebration and thanksgiving. Ustadz Adi Hidayat emphasizes the importance of maintaining a steadfast dedication to the path of goodness and righteousness beyond the month of Ramadan.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the significance of Ramadan and the Quran in guiding one's life. He explains that Allah has given the month of Ramadan as a time to reflect upon the Quran, which acts as a complete guide for one's life. The Quran helps individuals to distinguish between right and wrong, and to make choices that will lead them to a better life. By using the Quran as a guide, one can understand the significance of Qadar (divine predestination) and the importance of making the right choices in life. Ustadz Adi Hidayat emphasizes the need to use the Quran as a guide for all aspects of life, including personal, family, and professional matters.

He reminds listeners that Allah desires ease, and not hardship, and that while practicing religion should not be too easy, it should also not be too difficult. Finally, he suggests ways to keep track of one's progress during the month of Ramadan, such as counting the days in a comfortable and enjoyable manner, and keeping track of how many times one has prayed at night, all towards the goal of achieving a consistent and worthwhile practice in the month of Ramadan.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the joy and happiness felt by Muslims after successfully completing the month-long fasting of Ramadan. He emphasizes that Muslims should feel happy not just because the fasting is over, but more so because they have fulfilled Allah's commandment to perform the month-long act of worship. The act of worship is not just about abstaining from food and drink, but also about expressing gratitude to Allah and experiencing the different kinds of guidance provided by Allah, such as gaining deeper knowledge and understanding of Islam. The end of Ramadan is marked by expressing gratitude to Allah for allowing Muslims to fulfill the act of worship and for the guidance provided during the month.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the concept of taqwa and how receiving guidance and hidayah from Allah can strengthen one's iman and lead to an increase in amal saleh (good deeds). He emphasizes the importance of setting a program in Ramadan to maintain the consistency of good deeds and avoid fluctuations in iman. Additionally, he highlights that hidayah can lead to a positive change in behavior and reminds his audience to be grateful for the blessings and anugrah received from Allah.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat speaks about the importance of changing one's behavior even after Ramadan is over. He emphasizes the need for self-reflection and self-improvement to lead a better life. Hidayat notes that the real change comes from Hidayah, which increases a person's connection with Allah and helps them to remember Allah in all aspects of life. This leads to a stronger sense of morality and behavior that is not harmful to others. He also discusses the various kinds of takbir and notes that post-Ramadan, the takbir should be expressed as a feeling of gratitude towards Allah for the blessings of the month.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat emphasizes the importance of takbir and reflection during Ramadan. He also reminds viewers to be grateful for Allah's blessings and to strive towards increasing their good deeds and maintaining their faith. Additionally, he mentions the upcoming practice of sunnah after Ramadan, particularly the six-day fast that, when performed, is considered equivalent to a year's worth of fasting. By doing so, he hopes to inspire and motivate viewers to remain steadfast in their devotion to Islam, even after the conclusion of Ramadan.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat explains that the 30-day period of fasting in Ramadan is a cumulative representation of a full year. This is similar to how the Arabic term "Arbain" (meaning 40) is used to refer to a collection of 42 hadiths by Imam an-Nawawi. The idea is that the fasting during Ramadan is an accumulation of the entire year and a time for reflection, seeking forgiveness, and improving oneself. Ustadz Adi Hidayat concludes by hoping that our Ramadan fasting will be accepted by Allah and that we are granted a good ending to this blessed month.
