In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat talks about the importance of understanding the full curriculum of Ramadan, which includes the verses from 183 to 187 of Surah al-Baqarah that were revealed in the month of Sha'ban in the second year of Hijrah. The reason for the revelation of these verses one month prior to Ramadan was to give Prophet Muhammad time to explain the importance and technicalities of fasting during Ramadan. Ustadz Adi Hidayat emphasizes the importance of having an open heart and readiness to follow any instructions during Ramadan so that the desired quality of the month can be achieved. He also explains the concept of tarhim, which means to make the heart and soul spacious in order to be ready to accept whatever comes during the month of Ramadan.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat explains the three goals of Ramadan. The first goal is to increase personal piety, which is stated in Surah Al-Baqarah verse 183. Ramadan is designed to be a month-long worship to help shape the characteristics of every Muslim to have high personal piety. The second goal is to build social piety that can spread its aura to the environment, as being personally virtuous is optimal in the Quran if its character can optimize all social characters. Lastly, Ramadan is aimed to build the characteristic of being grateful to Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala. These goals are commonly expressed in the Quran through many verses, including Surah Al-Baqarah verse 187 and Surah Al-Baqarah verse 185.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the importance of preparing for the afterlife starting from our life in this world. He explains that just like we need provisions when traveling to different places, we also need provisions for the afterlife. These provisions are our good deeds, or "Hasanah," which are accumulated through our personal efforts and rituals such as prayer, reading the Quran, fasting, and others. Every Hasanah is worth 10 points and is essential for our journey to the afterlife. When we are called to leave this world, our good deeds will be our bekal, and we will be confirmed for our Hasanah. Therefore, it is essential to prioritize preparing for the afterlife in our daily lives.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat emphasizes the importance of preparing for the afterlife as it is inevitable that everyone will pass away one day. He explains how every good deed done during one's lifetime is rewarded with pahala, or blessings, and the concept of balance in Islam between striving for success in this world and the afterlife. The ustadz highlights the significance of puasa or fasting during Ramadan, as it serves as a reminder to people to remember the purpose of their existence and to prepare for their eventual return to Allah.

00:20:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat explains the three main purposes of fasting in Ramadan. Firstly, Allah permits the limited time of Ramadan to offer His love and compassion to believers and provide them with a high chance of receiving His mercy in the afterlife. This is why Ramadan is designed for all individuals to easily increase their good deeds. Secondly, Ramadan can help individuals push away and stop their bad habits or sins. For instance, someone who gets easily angry can tame their anger and meliorate themselves. Lastly, the Quran mentions the use of the word "ya" 361 times, which refers to a call that includes everyone regardless of their status. Therefore, Ramadan can be considered as a call for believers to optimize their fasting practices and move towards increasing their personal devotion to Allah.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the importance of having strong faith and how it can be measured according to a Quranic surah. He notes that a true believer responds to the call of Allah in the adhan, and how this can be a confirmation of one's faith. He also highlights the significance of the first day of Ramadan, where Allah's mercy is bestowed equally on all believers, regardless of their level of faith, and motivates them to increase their devotion during this holy month. Ustadz Adi stresses the importance of maintaining this initial motivation throughout Ramadan to truly reap the benefits of this sacred time.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat emphasizes the importance of Ramadan as an opportunity for self-correction and repentance. He explains that during the year, people are often too busy to focus on their spiritual growth, but Ramadan provides a chance to prioritize their relationship with Allah. Ustadz Adi Hidayat encourages Muslims to take advantage of this time to seek forgiveness and mend their ways. He explains that by asking for forgiveness and performing good deeds during Ramadan, one's sins can be forgiven and their chances of earning Allah's grace in the hereafter increase. Additionally, Ustadz Adi Hidayat notes that Ramadan holds unique rewards, such as the potential to receive more than 1000 months of pahala for praying during Laylat al-Qadr. Overall, he stresses the importance of using Ramadan as an opportunity to improve one's spiritual state and secure a positive outcome in the afterlife.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat explains the importance of taqwa (god-consciousness) in our daily prayers during Ramadan. Taqwa allows us to optimise our potential during worship, and helps us in fulfilling every aspect of our ibadah (worship). The holy month of Ramadan serves as a reminder of our mortality, and the need to accumulate as many good deeds as possible in order to secure a place in the afterlife. Ustadz Adi Hidayat also emphasises the importance of obtaining knowledge and building our relationship with Allah, regardless of our background or profession.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the importance of preparing for Ramadan and setting personal and social goals. He encourages Muslims to set a target for how much Quran they want to memorize and to focus on both personal and social acts of worship during Ramadan. He also emphasizes the importance of giving in charity and treating others with kindness and respect. Ustadz Adi explains that Muslims should not only focus on personal development during Ramadan but should also strive to help and support their communities.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat emphasizes the importance of giving quality infak during Ramadan, with the first priority being given to one's parents. He suggests preparing a budget for social schemes for Ramadan and allocating a portion of the fund to support the family, the nearest needy, orphans, and those in difficulty. The second priority should be given to non-Muslims in the form of a broader charity, such as sharing food or book studies to deepen their understanding of Islam. Lastly, Ustadz Adi Hidayat highlights that practicing charity during Ramadan can change a person's character for the better by providing them with a sense of tranquility and inner peace.

00:50:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the importance of finding peace and tranquility in one's life, particularly during the month of Ramadan. He explains that Allah grants individuals the gift of tranquility as a means to improve themselves, and it is only after achieving this peaceful state that they will be open to Allah's guidance. By finding peace, individuals can improve the quality of their worship and become more grateful to Allah. Ustadz Adi Hidayat also emphasizes the importance of expressing gratitude through actions, not just words, and mentions that the essence of Ramadan is to become a better person and to develop a stronger relationship with Allah. He promises to provide more detailed guidance on specific practices and actions to take during Ramadan in future videos and in a special Ramadan curriculum.
