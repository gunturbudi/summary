In this section, the speaker begins with expressing gratitude to Allah and praying that everyone's activities may be guided towards good deeds. He then recaps the previous lessons on the fundamental principles of faith and the importance of Tawheed. This section focuses on the fifth pillar of faith, Yaumul Akhir, or the Day of Judgment. The speaker covers topics such as the signs of the end of the world and the events that will occur on the Day of Judgment. He reminds viewers of the importance of improving their deeds to have a Husnul Khotimah, or a good ending, and to always seek knowledge to strengthen their faith.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the concept of commitment in worshiping Allah. He explains that by saying "Allah" as our God, we have already made a commitment to worship Him through our prayers. The first sentence we utter when we perform our prayers, "Allahu akbar," shows our commitment to worship Allah in the most significant way possible. Ustadz Adi also emphasizes the importance of the Quran and the guidance provided by the prophets, especially the guidance from the final prophet, Muhammad, in maintaining our commitment to Allah. The Quran is the only holy book that remains pure, valid, and authentic until now, confirming the truthfulness of the message conveyed by Muhammad.

00:10:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat emphasizes the importance of studying and understanding the signs of the Day of Judgment described in Alquran. He points out that all the truths contained in the Quran are proven and verified, both from the past and from present ongoing experiences. Therefore, there is no room for rejection of what is to come. Ustadz Adi also emphasizes the importance of recognizing that all the archeological, biological, and scientific evidence supports the Quran, and he concludes that everything in the Quran is unequivocally true.

00:15:00
In this section, the speaker talks about the importance of believing in the Day of Judgment and the need to have faith in the unseen, as well as the limitations of the intellect. He emphasizes the importance of reading and understanding the Quran, as it is the source of wisdom and guidance for a person's life. He also mentions how previous prophets were instructed to study and understand the scriptures of their time, and how having wisdom can lead to a better understanding of one's purpose in life. Ultimately, he encourages listeners to seek knowledge and guidance from the Quran, as it provides insights and solutions to all of life's challenges.

00:20:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the importance of holding on to the Quran as a guidebook, particularly when preparing for Yaumul Akhir or the Day of Judgment. He emphasizes the need for a strong belief ('keyakinan Paripurna') and motivation to improve this belief through a heightened understanding of the wisdom imparted in the holy book. Additionally, the lecture touches on the need for a structured curriculum in life that encompasses preparations towards the afterlife, which should extend beyond the basic moments of waking and sleeping. The video also talks about the significance of specific events related to Yaumul Akhir as well as the importance of keeping reminders of death to maintain one's focus on better preparations.

00:25:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the importance of understanding the difference between "ahwal" (states) and "ahwal" (moments) when it comes to impending events like death and the day of judgment. While small events are normal and common, significant events are more unsettling and can cause anxiety and fear. Those who are not prepared for death are often anxious because they lack the necessary preparation or "bekal" for the afterlife. For those who are ready, death is just a gateway to another world where they have the proper provisions to move forward.

00:30:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the importance of preparing oneself for the Day of Judgment. He mentions a popular hadith in which Prophet Muhammad compared the Muslims to ants or other animals competing for sugar, illustrating how weak and vulnerable they were as a community. However, despite their large numbers, they were easily swayed and could be seen as insignificant as foam on the ocean. Ustadz Adi emphasizes the need for Muslims to focus on building unity, strengthening their faith, and working towards their collective betterment, rather than being caught up in the pursuit of material gains and power. He warns against the dangers of becoming attached to the ephemeral pleasures of this world, which can lead to a lack of preparedness for death and the afterlife, as well as the corruption of one's deeds and character.

00:35:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat talks about the concept of Kiamat or the Day of Judgment, which is the ultimate destruction of the world and the resurrection of all humans from the dead. He emphasizes that all the good deeds done in one's lifetime will help in mitigating any negative aspects in the afterlife. The signs of Kiamat are also discussed, such as the resurrection of the dead, the chaos that will ensue, and the destruction of the universe. Ustadz Adi Hidayat delves into the linguistic roots of the word Kiamat, which refers to something that is standing upright and ready to move, and the linguistic connections between related words.

00:40:00
In this section of the video, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the idea of "takwim", which refers to perfecting something and making it ready for use. This concept of perfection applies not only to the physical body but also to the spiritual and social aspects of life. In order to be ready for social interactions and to have a balanced life, a person needs to have a perfect body, mind, and soul. The soul needs to be upright and strong enough to guide the body in its physical activities. The importance of prayer, which supports the soul, is emphasized as a means of achieving balance and perfection.

00:45:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat explains the importance of Taqwa in supporting spiritual interactions and enhancing the quality and quantity of worship. He mentions that Taqwa is crucial in improving personal, communal, and social relationships. Furthermore, he discusses how the concept of Taqwa is related to the end of times, where all activities and interactions will come to an end with the arrival of a unique command from Allah, which refers to the Day of Judgment or Kiamat. The Ustadz adds that the purpose of emphasizing the end of times is not only to illustrate the characteristics of the event but also to highlight the idea that all activities derived from certain words will come to an end with the emergence of Kiamat.

00:50:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the importance of understanding the concept of Qiyamah or the Day of Judgement, as it is a significant event that will mark the end of all phases and activities in this world. He emphasizes the need to increase our knowledge and understanding of the topic through various references and sources, including the Qur'an. Ustadz Adi Hidayat notes that while events like natural disasters serve as reminders of our mortality, they do not compare to the level of destruction and chaos that will occur during Qiyamah. He also stresses the importance of maintaining a balance between our worldly and spiritual pursuits, and of striving to increase our knowledge and understanding of both realms.

00:55:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the importance of understanding that not all phenomena can be simply observed and predicted through physical and rational means. Certain events can only be fully understood through spiritual understanding and the reading of rohnya (spirit). He emphasizes that disasters and tragedies should be used as an opportunity to come together to help and support one another, but also to reflect on our relationship with Allah and the importance of seeking His forgiveness. Additionally, Ustadz Adi Hidayat explains the different functions of the article "alif lam" which is used to specify and differentiate certain events, such as the "Dahsyatnya Hari Kiamat" which will completely destroy everything.

01:00:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the coming of the Day of Judgment and its significance. He emphasizes the importance of being prepared for the Day of Judgment, as it will come at an unexpected time and it is not just about the day itself, but also the time, place, and activities. Furthermore, he explains how humans should not engage in actions that are not productive or contradictive to Allah's laws, as this may lead to a negative outcome on the Day of Judgment. Ustadz Adi Hidayat highlights the need for believers to be aware and follow Allah's teachings to avoid such negative consequences.

01:05:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat talks about the chaos and destruction that will occur on the day of reckoning. People will be filled with regret and curse themselves for their past actions, and there will be a great fear that will make them feel the need to run and hide. He connects this idea to the concept of the petrifying flash of lightning mentioned in the Quran, which is used as a metaphor for the fear that will overcome the hypocrites. Eventually, there will be a time when even the moon disappears, and everything is destroyed, ending the universe as we know it.

01:10:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat describes the chaos that will happen on the Day of Judgment as described in Quran surah 80. People will be overwhelmed with fear and their activities will come to a halt, as they try to find shelter and protect themselves. The fear is so great that even siblings will no longer recognise each other while trying to flee. Ustadz Adi Hidayat gives the example of natural disasters like tsunamis and earthquakes, where people are filled with fear and panic. He emphasizes the importance of compassion and helping one another during times of uncertainty and turmoil, to uphold harmony and avoid conflict.

01:15:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the magnitude of the Day of Judgment and how everything will be destroyed. When the time comes, there will be chaos and even the ground that is stepped on will crumble into pieces. The Quran refers to this as "Zalzalah," meaning the shaking or earthquake that will occur. It is emphasized that we should increase our taqwa or fear of Allah as it will be a shield for all the tribulations that will occur during the Day of Judgment. The destruction that will occur is so great that everything will be turned upside down and a smalleduk will become as big as a mountain.

01:20:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the events that will occur during the Day of Judgment as described in the Quran, including the destruction of everything and the panic and realization of humanity. The blow that will cause everything to crumble and the chaos that will ensue is referred to as kiamat. The Quran describes the chaos and destruction in Surah 79 and Surah 22, confirming that everything will be destroyed and that even breastfeeding mothers will leave their children due to panic. Those who have faith and do good deeds will be spared from this situation. However, for those who do not have faith and continue to engage in sinful acts, they will be punished according to their deeds, and no one will remain to pray or perform good deeds.

01:25:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the uncertainty surrounding the specific timing of the end of the world. He emphasizes that while predictions about the end of times may provide guidance and insight, ultimately, only Allah knows the exact time and details. Therefore, he urges people to focus more on preparing for the end of times by improving their actions and faith. Tanda-tanda sa'ah or the signs of the Day of Judgment are highlighted in several verses of the Quran and hadiths, but Ustadz Adi Hidayat notes that it is more important to focus on general preparation than to get bogged down in specific calculations and predictions.

01:30:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the importance of a confirmation to show the truthfulness of the Prophet's message. The confirmation of the Day of Judgement is stated in Surah 31 Lukman ayat 34 and was confirmed by the angels, including Jibril. The Hadith also emphasized the importance of the confirmation from the Prophet Muhammad to ensure that his message was not a mere creation of opinions. The signs of the Day of Judgement, such as the prevalence of sinful activities and the neglect of worship, were also discussed. The focus on materialistic things has shifted the goals of people towards temporary gains and away from their spiritual obligations.

01:35:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat talks about the struggle to maintain the teachings of the Quran and the difficulty in producing ulama, or Islamic scholars. He emphasizes the importance of spirituality alongside intellectual and physical training in becoming an ulama, and the need to be consistent in promoting righteousness, avoiding the temptation to use one's knowledge for evil. Ustadz Adi Hidayat also mentions the importance of protecting and supporting the ulama, who are dwindling in numbers, and the need to avoid exposing one's sins and faults to the public.

01:40:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the three groups of people who will emerge after being judged by Allah on the Day of Judgment. The first group is the highly righteous individuals who will enter Paradise due to their immense faith and good deeds. The second group is the "Solehin," who are not as righteous and have committed sins but will still enter Paradise after serving a punishment in Hell. The third group is the "Ashabul A'raf," who have an equal balance of good and bad deeds and will only enter Paradise after undergoing a specific process. Ustadz Adi Hidayat also talks about the concept of "syafaat," which refers to the intercession granted by Allah to individuals due to their piety, love for the Quran, and respect for Prophet Muhammad. Finally, he touches upon some of the major signs that indicate the approach of the Day of Judgment, including the emergence of Imam Mahdi, the return of Prophet Isa (Jesus), and the sun rising from the west.

01:45:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat talks about the importance of understanding the formula for arranging one's life to achieve a perfect and fulfilling worship to Allah. He emphasizes the need to follow the guidance and seek support until one's death to ensure a peaceful, happy, and prosperous eternal life. Ustadz Adi Hidayat concludes the meeting by hoping for the usefulness of the discussion and asking for forgiveness for any shortcomings or mistakes made during the session.
