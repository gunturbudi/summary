In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the three main requirements for performing the obligatory fast during the holy month of Ramadan. The first requirement is the age of maturity where a Muslim becomes responsible for practicing his faith. The next is the ability to fast, which should be taken into account to avoid any harm. Lastly, Muslims are obliged to fast if they are mentally stable and have no medical conditions. Adi Hidayat believes that Islam does not impose a burden on its followers, but rather offers guidance and leads them to honor, benefit, and succeed in life.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat explains the conditions for fasting in Ramadan. The first condition is that a person must be physically capable of fasting, which is determined through medical evaluation. If a person is unable to fast due to illness or other valid reasons, they are allowed to make up the missed days later. Children who have not yet reached the age of puberty are not required to fast, but they can still participate in the experience of fasting as practice and adaptability. The second condition is that if a person is medically incapable of fasting altogether, then they are exempted from the obligation and can make up the missed days by paying Fidyah.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat explains that if one cannot perform the obligatory fasting due to a valid reason such as illness or pregnancy, they can pay Fidyah, which is feeding a poor person. However, he emphasizes that if a person has the means to feed more than one person, they should do so. He also explains that to fulfill the second condition of valid fasting, the individual must be a Muslim and must fast during the designated times of the day, which starts from dawn until sunset. The exact time for fasting can be determined by using either the method of hisab or rukyat, both of which aim to ensure the correct beginning and end of Ramadan.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the importance of intention in observing the Ramadan fast and how it plays a crucial role in differentiating one act of worship from another. He emphasizes that the motivation behind performing an act of worship will determine its value in the eyes of Allah, and intention serves as the link between the heart, mind, and conduct. He also explains the criteria for the obligatory and valid conditions of fasting, such as having a healthy mind and being of sound age, and how they must be fulfilled simultaneously to ensure the act is considered mandatory and lawful. Conversely, if any conditions such as having an unsound mind are not met, then the act would not be obligatory, and the person would not be held accountable for not observing it.

In this section, we learn about the three criteria for the validity of fasting during Ramadan. These criteria include mental competence, purity, and a specific timeframe. Mental competence means that an individual who is not mentally competent cannot participate in fasting. Women who are menstruating or experiencing post-natal bleeding are not considered pure and must refrain from fasting until their purity is restored. The fasting timeframe is fixed, and those who fast must stop eating and drinking before dawn and abstain from doing so until after sunset. While scholars may have different interpretations of these criteria, it is important to adhere to them to ensure that one is fasting correctly and maintaining mental and physical well-being during Ramadan.

He emphasizes that these conditions should not be taken lightly, and reminds his audience of the spiritual benefits of fasting, including increasing one's taqwa (piety) and earning Allah's reward.
