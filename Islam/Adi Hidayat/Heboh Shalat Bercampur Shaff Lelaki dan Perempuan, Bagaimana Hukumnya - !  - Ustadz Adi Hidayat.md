In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat begins by emphasizing the importance of salat as an essential part of a Muslim's faith and connection to Allah. He then proceeds to address the recent controversy surrounding the mixing of genders in prayer, stating that this issue has been discussed and clarified by Islamic scholars. Salat is not only a form of worship but also serves to provide a strong foundation for a Muslim's identity and behavior.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat emphasizes the importance of performing the prayer correctly according to the guidance of the Prophet Muhammad to stay away from two sources of evil desires: pornography and LGBT practices. The correct prayer has a transformative effect on the person, leading them to abandon evil deeds and embrace good ones. The prayer also becomes the cornerstone of a Muslim's life as it determines one's overall good deeds, and it forms the first act of worship that Allah will judge on the Day of Judgment. The coordination and attention to detail with which prayer has been prescribed in Islam signify its significant role as a means of connecting with Allah and attaining His pleasure.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the importance of praying in congregation and following the guidance of the Prophet Muhammad. He explains that our faith is tied to two main commitments: to acknowledge that there is no God but Allah and to worship Him by following His guidance, which we can find in the Hadiths. He refers to a specific Hadith in which the Prophet instructs his followers on arranging their rows in prayer and the importance of being in the front row. The Hadith shows the precision and accuracy of Hadiths and their reliable sources, which are traced back to the Prophet. Ustadz Adi Hidayat emphasizes that Islam's beauty lies in the fact that all arguments and practices are based on the guidance of the Prophet and not personal desires or creations, and he encourages Muslims to strive to be in the front row of prayer.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the arrangement of male and female congregations in prayer. According to Al Imam an-Nawawi, the Prophet Muhammad ordered that men should be placed in the front rows and women in the back rows in order to prevent mingling between genders during prayer. Al Imam al-Mawardi also stressed the importance of separating the genders during congregational prayer to prevent any possible non-physical mingling between them. This shows that not only should prayer be done with due diligence and observance of its conditions and pillars, but also in accordance with proper adab and akhlak to maintain the values of obedience and dignity in the sight of Allah.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the different views of Islamic scholars regarding the mixing of men and women during prayer. Scholars agree that prayer with direct contact between men and women is not valid and batal, but there is disagreement when there is a physical barrier between them. The Hanafi view is that the prayer could be valid for women, but not for men due to the potential presence of certain desires. However, the majority opinion, including the Maliki school, is that such prayer in a mixed congregation is not acceptable and is strongly disliked. Allah's detailed regulations regarding prayer and the importance of sincerity and devotion are emphasized, and any motivation other than pure worship is condemned in the Quran.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat emphasizes that the purpose of Salat is to show our devotion to Allah, not to impress others or seek their approval. He explains that those who are distracted by their appearance or seek to be noticed by others during Salat are guilty of ad-dabinahum yuraun or seeking the admiration of others. Salat is meant to humble us before Allah, and those who approach Salat with the intention of impressing others will ultimately find themselves humbled before Allah. Adi Hidayat's purpose is not to criticize or shame anyone but to provide clarity and guidance to those seeking to deepen their faith. He urges everyone to focus on inner devotion and to support one another in their spiritual journeys.
