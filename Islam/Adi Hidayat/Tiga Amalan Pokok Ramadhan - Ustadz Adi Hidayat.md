In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses taqwa and the importance of being serious in the act of fasting during Ramadan. He emphasizes that not all individuals who fast will attain taqwa and the four benefits unless they are serious in their fasting. Therefore, the Ustadz emphasizes the importance of the three main practices which include increasing the performance of Salat, performing Tahajjud prayer, and performing Itikaf. These practices were strengthened by the Prophet before Ramadan and have since become part of the Ramadan curriculum. Among the essential practices mentioned is Rawatib,  which are sunnah prayers that are done before or after the obligatory prayers.

In this section, the speaker talks about the importance of performing Dhuha prayer, which involves two to four voluntary units of prayer performed after sunrise and before midday. Benefits of performing Dhuha prayer include replacing all forms of remembrance of God, facilitating the arrival of sustenance, and preventing or overcoming tribulations. The speaker also suggests interacting more with the Quran by making a target for reading it, reciting and studying it, and investing time in learning its verses. Additionally, he advises infaq, which involves spending one's money and resources in charitable work, in order to emulate the generosity and kindness of the Prophet Muhammad.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the concept of facilitating the breaking of the fast for others and how it can lead to rewards without compromising one's own fast. He mentions the hadith that states that even the smallest offering of a date and some water to someone who is fasting will result in the same reward as the person who is fasting, but notes that this does not mean that one should indulge in excessive amounts of food and drink during Ramadan. He emphasizes the importance of giving to charity and making donations, citing the potential to receive 700 times the reward for one good deed. Ustadz Adi Hidayat suggests preparing to give to charity even before Ramadan starts, such as allocating money in advance to give to those in need. He ends with a prayer for the health, strength, and safety of all Muslims during Ramadan.
