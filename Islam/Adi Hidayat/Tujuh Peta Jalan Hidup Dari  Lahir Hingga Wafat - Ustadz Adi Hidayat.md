In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the seven parts of life's roadmap that can be found in the Quran for Bani Adam or human beings. The seven parts are the missions that Allah has entrusted to Adam and his descendants as His representatives on Earth, which is to be a successor, to bring beneficial things, and to carry out tasks successfully and happily, and all activities are called ibadah or worship. To make a life roadmap, we need to start with iman or faith, which is the first thing that Allah has reminded us of before we start our life's mission as Khalifah on Earth. Faith is the basis that makes all our actions towards Allah called Soleh. To connect ourselves to Allah, Ustadz Adi Hidayat suggested building connectivity with Allah through ibadah, with the first one being prayer or salat.

He discusses how Islam teaches individuals to learn and understand the challenges in everything they do, whether in education, business, or even marriage. He emphasizes the need to follow the guidance of the Prophet and to be aware of the provocations of Satan in every activity, as good deeds always come with the potential for temptation.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the importance of preparing oneself for the journey of life, particularly in terms of cultivating takwa (piety). He compares this preparation to that of getting dressed for a formal event, where we must have a clear understanding of the path we will take and what we need to do to arrive at our destination successfully. One of the ways to prepare for this journey is to dress appropriately with a pakaian takwa, clothes that cover our aurat (private parts) and reflect our dignity as human beings. This means we must avoid dressing in a way that makes our aurat visible, as it is not pleasing to the eyes and can lead others to have improper intentions towards us. By dressing modestly and avoiding indecent exposure, we can maintain our takwa and continually strive towards becoming better Muslims.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat emphasizes the importance of dressing appropriately and covering one's aurat, but he also stresses that there is no specific dress code in Islam except for the need to cover the aurat. He suggests that people should wear clothing that suits their tradition or adapt to local customs, and not criticize other people's choices. He also stresses that dressing well is not enough, as people should demonstrate good behavior and values. One's appearance should not be the sole factor in determining their character or worthiness. Ultimately, a person's actions and character are more important than their appearance, and true adornment comes from one's Taqwa.

He advises against using differences to create boundaries and encourages Muslims to unite and ridicule hate speech.

He suggests that understanding the connection of faith, its practices, and its challenges can help people to create a map or path to their journey to achieve sustainable life.

In this section, the speaker talks about how physical appearance should not be the benchmark for measuring a person's worth. The physical features of an individual are designed by Allah to suit their specific purpose in life. The differences in skin tone, eye color, and other physical attributes are adaptations to unique climates and environments. Changing one's appearance is dangerous and can cause problems in the future. It is essential to be content with one's appearance as it is, and focus on fulfilling one's mission in life.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the importance of accepting one's natural features and not being tempted by Satan's provocation to change them. He advises against altering one's physical appearance through methods such as plastic surgery or tattoos, as these practices go against the natural fitrah that Allah has bestowed upon us. Furthermore, he emphasizes the importance of using one's eyes to look at what is right and not indulging in viewing inappropriate images, which can lead to a loss of one's honor in society.
