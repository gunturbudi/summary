In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the importance of measuring the success of one's fasting, particularly during the month of Ramadan. In a hadith, Prophet Muhammad explains that true success in fasting is not just abstaining from food and drink during the day, but also adhering to the rules and regulations set forth by Allah and the Prophet. It is important to remember that fasting should not just be about physical sacrifices, but also fulfilling the spiritual requirements of the practice.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat explains that when we fast in accordance with the rules and regulations, it will result in an invisible shield that integrates with our souls. This shield helps prevent us from committing sins, and comes from the act of carrying out good deeds throughout Ramadan, with the pinnacle being taqwa. Taqwa, he explains, can be seen from two perspectives: carrying out Allah's commands, and staying away from His prohibitions. Through performing good deeds, such as increasing prayer and reciting Quran throughout Ramadan, we produce taqwa, which results in building a shield that prevents us from committing sins.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat talks about the importance of watching our words and maintaining positive behavior during fasting. He mentions that negative actions such as pornography, gossiping or spreading hoaxes are not acceptable during fasting. However, there are positive behaviors that are allowed such as affection between spouses during the night of fasting, as described in Al-Baqarah verse 187. Ustadz Adi Hidayat urges viewers to exercise caution when speaking during fasting as it is the representation of one's thoughts and feelings. He also emphasizes that fasting is a time to build character and practice good behavior so that one can avoid negative traits such as jealousy or hatred.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat talks about the importance of controlling our speech during Ramadan. He emphasizes that mastering our language can prevent 90% of conflicts and arguments. He also reminds us that "terpeleset lisan" (slips of the tongue) is more dangerous than "terpeleset kaki" (slips of the feet), as it can cause us to lose our status and bring harm to others. Moreover, he explains that certain words or actions may not seem sinful but might have the potential to lead others into sin, such as sharing hoaxes or insulting others. Therefore, he stresses the importance of guarding ourselves against committing "jahalah" (meaningless or foolish deeds that lead to sin) and training ourselves to prevent wrongdoing during Ramadan.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the signs of success in fasting. Muslims who are able to control their anger are promised a place in heaven. Additionally, people who can control themselves and their words to avoid negativity are given the honor of having a fragrant mouth, a sign of success according to the Prophet. The fragrance is not just any scent, but rather one that comes from their good deeds and control over their actions. This concept is a figure of speech, but its true meaning is that those who uphold good behavior will be honored in the afterlife, as evidenced by the Prophet Muhammad's statements. Ustadz Adi Hidayat cites examples of people who possessed such a fragrance, including an Imam who was able to detect mistakes in Quran recitation solely by analyzing the movement of someoneâ€™s lips.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the signs of a successful fast, which include being freed from sinful desires and receiving Allah's protection and honor. True fasting involves leaving behind sinful habits and behaviors and instead focusing on good deeds while nourishing the body with enough food and drink to have the energy to complete these tasks. Fasting is different from other types of worship because it is valued directly by Allah, who multiplies its reward beyond measure. The ustadz explains that a successful fast leads to protection, dignity, and honor in this life as well as multiplied rewards in the hereafter.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the technical difficulties they have been experiencing on their YouTube channel, particularly the sudden disruptions during their usual streaming schedule. He mentions the playlist they have created for the Kitabush Shaum series and encourages viewers to use it if they encounter any problems during the program. He reminds the audience that their priority is to learn and not to focus on numbers, and they should approach the series as an act of worship. He also asks for forgiveness if they have caused any offense and prays for their efforts to be accepted by Allah.
