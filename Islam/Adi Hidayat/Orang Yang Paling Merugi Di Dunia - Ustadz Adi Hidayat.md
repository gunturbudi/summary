In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat explains that after death there is a life that continues, known as the hereafter or 'akhirat'. People who do not believe in the existence of the hereafter tend to focus only on the present world and its pleasures, often participating in activities that ultimately lead to a loss. Ustadz Adi Hidayat points out that moving from one place to another requires preparation and provisions, whether it's moving to a different city or a different country, and since the hereafter is a completely different realm, one needs to prepare accordingly. The things of this world will be left behind, and the rules and provisions will be different in the hereafter.

He emphasizes that even those who have dedicated their lives to serve Allah, like mothers who raise their children while maintaining halal practices, will be rewarded in the grave.

In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the importance of having a curriculum in our lives that leads to the hereafter. He suggests following the Quran's curriculum that starts with Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayat 153-157, and then Surah Ali 'Imran, Ayat 169-172, and ultimately Surah Al-Hashr, Ayat 18, which outlines the importance of being a believer and fearing Allah. Ustadz Adi Hidayat emphasizes the need to have a program in our lives to strive towards being a better Muslim and to reach the end of the line, which, according to him, is the hereafter. He goes on to explain that the hereafter is the endpoint of life, and there is nothing else after that. It is our final destination, and we will either end up in Jannah or hell. He warns against those who take the concept of hell lightly and says that those with an unhealthy soul are more dangerous than those with an unhealthy body.
