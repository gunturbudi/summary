In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the concept of "fikih setan" or understanding the devil, also known as "mengenal setan." He starts by providing a root understanding of Satan in Islam, mentioning the Quranic verses related to Satan's challenge against Allah, how he provoked humans, and his antagonistic nature towards the angels. Ustadz Adi Hidayat then moves on to Quran Surah 91, verses 7-10, which discuss the nature and origin of Satan, allowing for a deeper understanding of the devil's role and how to approach the concept of "fikih setan."

00:05:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the creation of Basyar, a new creature mentioned in Surah al-Hijr. Basyar is different from the angels and Jin who were already created before it. Its creation was mentioned to both the angels and Jin, indicating that Basyar's appearance and character combine both Taqwa and the nature of desires. The angels were created from Nur (light), while Jin were created from fire. The discussion then leads to the anatomy of humans, which was previously discussed in another talk that can be found on the Mira Institute's YouTube channel.

00:10:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat explains the process of how the human soul is blown into a physical body and turns into the source of life, which is called "nafas" in Indonesian. The soul is the generator that moves and activates the physical body to perform daily activities. Once the soul enters the physical body, it becomes known as "nafas," the source of life, and it is what gives humans the ability to breathe and live. This process is mentioned in Surah 91 of the Quran, and humans are then given the potential for intellect as they continue to grow and mature.

00:15:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat explains that when the spirit enters the physical body, it brings with it two potentials that work together to support all the physical activities and behaviors of an individual. These two potentials are inspired within the breath and are meant to work synergistically to catalyze and support values and the brightness of goodness. This is the foundation of our conscious or unconscious thoughts, feelings, and actions. These potentials are aimed at fostering excellence, and they support all good values that shape an individual's Takwa potential, which encompasses all good character traits such as honesty, patience, and loyalty. All angels, being created with this Takwa potential, consistently uphold good values, and Allah has assigned different angels, including the Hafidhin, to guard and guide humans towards cultivating their Takwa.

00:20:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat explains two of the functions of the angels mentioned in the Quran, Raqib and Atid. The names are actually attributes of the angels, and they are known for their strong and constant presence. They are responsible for recording good deeds and actions of human beings, which supports the concept of taqwa or piety. This attribute of the angels can be compared to the honest nature of a person like Doni. The support from Allah, in addition to the encouragement from the angels and through worship, helps to nurture and strengthen taqwa within us. The goal is to cultivate a bright aura of goodness in our actions and behavior, which is a reflection of our faith and piety.

00:25:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat explains how Allah supports humans in their efforts to do good by providing them with a catalyst to speed up the process. He uses the example of how Satan is not created to be evil, but to be a catalyst for humans to become better. He also explains how prayer, when done correctly, can purify thoughts and behavior and prevent people from being influenced by negative behavior sources. Finally, he discusses how the concept of "opposites attract" can be used as a catalyst for personal growth and to understand the positives in people and situations.

00:30:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat explains that the concept of anger was created to support honesty and elevate the quality of life. The objective is to find the best solution to a problem, not to remain silent or accept things as they are. When we respond with patience and wisdom, we improve our ability to face future challenges. The function of anger and other negative traits is not to make us do bad things but to support the good by challenging us to overcome our weaknesses. The negative image of these traits is the result of the influence of a certain creature that asks Allah for permission to entice people to do bad things.

00:35:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses how Satan was cursed by Allah and banished from his exalted position due to his arrogance and desire to prove himself superior. Satan then requested from Allah the ability to corrupt and control humans as a means of proving his superiority, and asked for a portion of mankind to achieve this. Ustadz Adi Hidayat clarifies that when Allah refers to "Bani Adam," He is referring to descendants of Adam and Eve who were placed on Earth as His stewards. Their mission, as Ustadz Adi Hidayat states, was to live in worship and follow Allah's commandments. He emphasizes the importance of living a life devoted to worship, allowing all activities to become a means of serving and pleasing Allah, and remembering that this is the ultimate mission for humankind on Earth.

00:40:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the concept of ibadah, or worship, and reminds the audience that everything in this world is temporary and will eventually be left behind. The only thing that we can take with us to the afterlife is the benefit we gained from the possessions and resources that Allah has given us. The speaker emphasizes the importance of making a commitment to ibadah and strengthening our faith by regularly reciting an ibadah pledge. However, he notes that there is a creature who requests permission to deceive us and hinder our ibadah, and advises us to be vigilant against this deceiver. Finally, the speaker explains how the concepts of taqwa, iman, and ibadah are intertwined and should work together to guide our actions.

00:45:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the workings of Satan in influencing humans to do evil. He explains that Satan aims to hinder the mission of worship by encouraging humans to choose their sinful potentials over their piety. Satan was created by Allah to support this process and was granted a portion of human characteristics, which he then uses to try to provoke humans. However, Allah also provides protection for humans and offers guidance in the Quran for how to resist the influence of Satan. If humans are able to work on their faith, they can create a spiritual fortress that Satan cannot penetrate, making his provocations useless.

00:50:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses how Satan works to push individuals towards negativity and bad behavior. He emphasizes the importance of using humility as a tool to counteract satanic influences and purify oneself. Hidayat stresses that filthiness is not something to be discarded, but something to be cleaned in order to reveal beauty and cleanliness. Satan's influence can lead individuals to practice dishonesty, arrogance, and anger. These qualities are referred to as su in Arabic and they push individuals towards bad behavior. The ustadz explains that these impulses can be eliminated by being attentive to what the heart is saying and to how one's body is responding.

00:55:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat explains how humans cannot be considered completely pure and holy, as even prophets and messengers are sinless due to Allah's protection. When people stand alone, they are more susceptible to wrongdoing, and Satan whispers and gives commands to conduct evil deeds. This is why performing deeds such as fasting and prayer help control one's desires and urges. Humans have a breath, and within that breath, there is fujur or a tendency toward disobedience, and if followed, it may cause one to perform bad actions. Through support and performing righteous deeds, one can raise their level of taqwa and avoid negative influences. However, if one follows the path of evil, they may be contemptible both in this life and the hereafter.

01:00:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the concept of nafas and qolbu in relation to the influence of both angels and Satan. The qolbu is the center of one's being and provides a constant source of internal conflict between good and evil. The nafas is the breath that resides in the qolbu and is influenced by both angels and Satan. The support for fujur is provided by Satan, while the push towards righteousness comes from the nature of truth within one's being. The higher level of the qolbu is called the sulur, which is the source of inspiration and guidance for one's actions. Women are also highlighted as possessing this innate ability to inspire and guide others through their sulur.

01:05:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses how Satan works to activate our negative qualities or desires. Satan enters through the heart and tries to prevent good deeds by creating waswasa or doubts. His tactics are very subtle and not forceful. Satan can provoke human weaknesses and negative qualities by whispering doubts that can slowly enter the soul and behavior. Muslims are given protective measures such as instructions from the Quran and Hadith but many people often ignore them. Therefore, Adi Hidayat believes it is essential for people to follow the true guidance from the Quran instead of creating their own.

01:10:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the nature of Satan and how he operates. He emphasizes that only in the Quran does Allah declare to be the one true god and the object of worship, and it is only within the Quran that one can find proper guidance in life. Satan's role, he explains, is to offer subtle suggestions or was-was, which only have an impact if we let them. But despite his influence, Satan cannot force us to do anything we do not want to do. Ustadz Adi Hidayat also mentions the importance of fully understanding the meaning, purpose, and hikmah (wisdom) behind each act of worship and how it impacts our behavior and how fiqih (Islamic jurisprudence) teaches us not only the ritual aspect but the deeper meaning, wisdom, and practical implementation as well.

01:15:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the importance of guarding oneself against the whispers of Satan and following the good whispers of the angels. He highlights the significance of seeking fatwas that lead to goodness and not listening to incorrect ones, just as one would not seek advice from a corrupt person. Ustadz stresses the importance of maintaining good intentions while listening to the whispers of the angels and avoiding any additional elements that could lead to mistakes, such as adding extra digits while performing a task. He further illustrates how the act of Salah and reciting Iftitah and Duas can help individuals in guarding their hearts against Satan's provocation and keeping them on the right path to goodness.

01:20:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the importance of following Islamic teachings and avoiding sinful behavior in order to support one's spiritual growth. He emphasizes that those who pray and follow the teachings of Allah are less likely to succumb to sin, while those who do not follow these teachings often engage in sinful behavior. He also raises the question of the devil himself, delving into his origins, motivations, and tactics in the next episode. Ultimately, Ustadz Adi Hidayat encourages viewers to seek out and follow the teachings of the Quran and hadith in order to live a more fulfilling and virtuous life.

01:25:00
In this section, Ustadz Adi Hidayat discusses the workings of Satan, and mentions how his aim is to lead humans astray by taking advantage of their sinful nature. He also highlights how some people have vivid imaginations which can sometimes result in criminal acts, including spiritual crimes like seeking help from dukuns. He emphasizes the need to seek protection from Allah and understand the history of Satan and angels to avoid falling into the traps of the evil one. The next episode will focus on understanding Satan's identity so that one can easily avoid his negative influences and remain pure before Allah.
