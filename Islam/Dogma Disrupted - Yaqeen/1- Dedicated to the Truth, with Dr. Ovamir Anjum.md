Pengantar: Etika adalah aspek fundamental dalam Islam, yang meliputi kategorisasi tindakan manusia, peran Syariah, sejarah tasawuf, evaluasi diri, pemisahan agama dan etika, dan disiplin Etika dalam yurisprudensi Islam. Dalam seri video "Dedicated to the Truth," Dr. Ovamir Anjum dan Imam Tom Facchine menyelidiki berbagai aspek etika dalam Islam. Artikel blog ini memberikan analisis mendalam tentang diskusi mendalam mereka, menyoroti poin-poin penting dan menjelaskan pentingnya etika dalam ajaran Islam.

1. Etika sebagai Inti dari Islam: Etika, atau moralitas, memiliki posisi sentral dalam Islam, yang mendefinisikan tindakan sebagai benar atau salah, baik atau buruk. Anjum menekankan bahwa etika meliputi semua ajaran Islam, membimbing individu dalam menjalani kehidupan yang benar dan mengungkapkan rasa syukur kepada Sang Pencipta. Meskipun Islam tidak memiliki istilah khusus untuk etika, Islam mencakup makna khusus yang muncul dari waktu ke waktu, seperti fikih, yang berkaitan dengan kewajiban yang ditentukan oleh Allah.
2. Kategorisasi Tindakan Manusia: Pembahasan ini mengeksplorasi kategorisasi tindakan manusia dalam Islam, termasuk kewajiban, anjuran, tindakan netral, tindakan yang tidak disukai, dan tindakan yang dilarang. Setiap tindakan yang berdimensi normatif dalam Islam memiliki perintah Ilahi yang melekat padanya, yang membentuk bagian integral dari Syariah. Anjum mengajukan pertanyaan tentang bagaimana tindakan etis, seperti kejujuran dan doa, dapat menjadi kebiasaan yang mendarah daging dan praktik yang dicintai. Hal ini mengarah pada eksplorasi disiplin adab atau tazkiyah, yang berfokus pada pembentukan etika individu dan menumbuhkan kecintaan terhadap tindakan etis melalui pengingat dan praktik.
3. Peran Syariah dalam Memberikan Bimbingan: Peran Syariah dalam memberikan panduan dalam setiap aspek kehidupan dibahas, termasuk isu-isu kontemporer seperti mengemudi dan mematuhi batas kecepatan. Syariah mencakup perintah-perintah khusus yang disebutkan dalam Al-Quran, serta perintah umum untuk berbuat baik dan berbuat amal kepada orang lain dan seluruh ciptaan. Anjum menyoroti prinsip menghindari bahaya dan pentingnya mengikuti aturan yang ditetapkan oleh penguasa Muslim yang sah sebagai ketaatan kepada Allah dan rasul-Nya.
4. Hubungan antara Agama dan Etika: Diskusi ini membahas hubungan antara agama dan etika, dengan menekankan bahwa etika adalah inti dari sekularisme. Konsep menjadi baik tanpa Tuhan, yang diusulkan oleh sekularisme, dieksplorasi, dan pentingnya terlibat dengan pertanyaan dan tradisi di luar Syariah ditekankan. Meskipun etika tidak dapat dipisahkan dari hukum Islam, diskusi ini mengakui bahwa pembentukan etika membutuhkan keterlibatan yang lebih luas dengan pertanyaan dan prinsip-prinsip moral.
5. Evolusi dan Legitimasi Sufisme: Sejarah dan evolusi tasawuf dieksplorasi, menyoroti perannya sebagai salah satu dari sekian banyak gerakan tazkia dalam Islam. Sufisme muncul sebagai sebuah gerakan yang berfokus pada psikologi hubungan dengan Allah dan ciptaan Allah. Diskusi ini menekankan keabsahan evaluasi diri dalam tasawuf dan pentingnya mencintai Allah dan beribadah kepada-Nya seakan-akan melihat-Nya. Percakapan ini juga menyentuh berbagai gerakan tazkia dalam Islam, seperti Malamathia dan kantung, yang mendahului kemunculan tasawuf.
6. Etika dan Masyarakat Modern: Diskusi ini merefleksikan bagaimana Islam memandang etika dibandingkan dengan masyarakat modern. Kebangkitan sekularisme dan pendekatan rasionalnya yang murni dalam menentukan benar dan salah ditelaah, dengan menekankan perlunya menumbuhkan kebiasaan baik daripada hanya mengandalkan rasionalitas. Konsep etika kenabian dalam Islam, yang berfokus pada pemodelan perilaku para nabi, juga dibahas. Perlu dicatat bahwa etika Islam tidak boleh terbatas pada Syariah saja, tetapi harus melibatkan pertanyaan dan tradisi yang lebih luas.

Introduction: Ethics is a fundamental aspect of Islam, encompassing the categorization of human actions, the role of Sharia, the history of Sufism, self-evaluation, the separation of religion from ethics, and the discipline of Ethics in Islamic jurisprudence. In the video series "Dedicated to the Truth," Dr. Ovamir Anjum and Imam Tom Facchine delve into these various aspects of ethics in Islam. This blog post provides an in-depth analysis of their insightful discussion, highlighting key points and shedding light on the significance of ethics in Islamic teachings.

1. Ethics as the Essence of Islam: Ethics, or morality, holds a central place in Islam, defining actions as right or wrong, good or bad. Dr. Anjum emphasizes that ethics pervades all teachings of Islam, guiding individuals in leading a righteous life and expressing gratitude to the Creator. Although Islam lacks a specific term for ethics, it encompasses specialized meanings that have emerged over time, such as jurisprudence, which deals with the obligations prescribed by Allah.
2. Categorization of Human Actions: The discussion explores the categorization of human actions in Islam, including obligations, recommendations, neutral actions, disliked actions, and prohibited actions. Every action with a normative dimension in Islam has a Divine command attached to it, forming an integral part of the Sharia. Dr. Anjum raises the question of how ethical actions, such as truthfulness and prayer, can become ingrained habits and beloved practices. This leads to an exploration of the discipline of adab or tazkiya, which focuses on the ethical formation of individuals and cultivating love for ethical actions through reminders and practices.
3. Role of Sharia in Providing Guidance: The role of Sharia in providing guidance in every aspect of life is discussed, including contemporary issues such as driving and obeying speed limits. Sharia encompasses specific commandments mentioned in the Quran, as well as the general commandment to do good and act charitably towards others and all of creation. Dr. Anjum highlights the principle of avoiding harm and the significance of following the rules established by legitimate Muslim rulers as obedience to Allah and His messenger.
4. Relationship between Religion and Ethics: The discussion examines the relationship between religion and ethics, emphasizing that ethics is the essence of secularism. The concept of being good without God, proposed by secularism, is explored, and the importance of engaging with questions and traditions beyond the Sharia is emphasized. While ethics is inseparable from Islamic law, the discussion acknowledges that ethical formation requires a broader engagement with moral questions and principles.
5. Evolution and Legitimacy of Sufism: The history and evolution of Sufism are explored, highlighting its role as one of many tazkia movements in Islam. Sufism emerged as a movement focused on the psychology of the relationship with Allah and the creation of Allah. The discussion emphasizes the legitimacy of self-evaluation in Sufism and the importance of loving Allah and worshiping Him as if one sees Him. The conversation also touches upon the different tazkia movements in Islam, such as Malamathia and sac, that preceded the emergence of Sufism.
6. Ethics and Modern Society: The discussion reflects on how Islam views ethics in comparison to modern society. The rise of secularism and its purely rational approach to determining right and wrong is examined, emphasizing the need to cultivate good habits rather than relying solely on rationality. The concept of prophetic ethics in Islam, focusing on modeling the behavior of prophets, is also discussed. It is noted that Islamic ethics should not be confined to the Sharia alone but should engage with broader questions and traditions.

### [00:00:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=emn9tgLENTA&t=0) - [01:00:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=emn9tgLENTA&t=3600)

Dr. Ovamir Anjum and Imam Tom Facchine discuss various aspects of ethics in Islam in the video series "Dedicated to the Truth". The discussion covers the categorization of human actions, the role of Sharia in providing guidance, the history and evolution of Sufism, self-evaluation and self-critique, the separation of religion from ethics, and the discipline of Ethics in Islamic jurisprudence. The concept of ethics as actions being right or wrong, good or bad, is present throughout Islam's teachings, and all of Islam is ethics. The duo emphasizes the importance of cultivating good habits and the need for ethical formation of the human being through proper reminders and practices. They also discuss the history and evolution of the various tazkia movements in Islam, emphasizing that self-evaluation is a legitimate ground upon which legitimate Sufism stands. The central importance of loving Allah and worshiping him as if you see him is also discussed. The separation of religion from ethics is viewed as the essence of secularism, which proposes a radical move that says one can be good without God, while ethical formation requires an engagement with questions and traditions beyond the Sharia. Finally, the importance of not abandoning the fundamental task of which life is created and the need for the discipline of ethics in Islamic jurisprudence are emphasized.

- **[00:00:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=emn9tgLENTA&t=0)** In this section of the podcast, Dr. Ovamir Anjum discusses the concept of ethics in Islam. He explains that ethics, or morality, refers to the idea of actions being right or wrong, good or bad, and is present throughout Islam's teachings. Dr. Anjum notes that all of Islam is ethics, as it is about the right way to live and respond to life, including recognizing the one Creator and expressing gratitude for the gifts given. While there is no specific word for ethics in Islam, specialized meanings have emerged over time, such as jurisprudence, which deals with the obligations given by Allah.
- **[00:05:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=emn9tgLENTA&t=300)** In this section of the video, Dr. Ovamir Anjum discusses how Islam has a categorization of every action, whether it's an obligation, recommended, neutral, disliked, or prohibited. He explains that every human action that has a normative dimension has a Divine command attached to it and is part of the Sharia. However, he raises the question of how one can make those ethical actions, such as truthfulness and prayer, a habit and beloved. This leads to the discussion of the discipline of adab or tazkiya and tasawolf, which focuses on the ethical formation of the human being and how one can cultivate the love for ethical actions through proper reminders and practices.
- **[00:10:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=emn9tgLENTA&t=600)** In this section, Imam Tom Facchine and Dr. Ovamir Anjum discuss the two different aspects of ethical concerns, which are discovering ethics and the inculcation of a person who acts ethically. While discovering ethics is limited in human input, the inculcation or cultivation of a person who acts ethically is open to practices that achieve results. Although Allah and his messenger have taught us what is right and wrong and how to respond to them, there are still areas that are negotiable, such as culture, while others are non-negotiable. The burden of proof shifts to doing whatever satisfies a command as long as it's not explicitly prohibited.
- **[00:15:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=emn9tgLENTA&t=900)** In this section, Dr. Ovamir Anjum discusses how the Islamic concept of Sharia provides guidance in every aspect of life, including modern issues like driving and obeying speed limits. He notes that avoiding harm is a significant principle of Sharia and following rules or hukum of a legitimate Muslim ruler is considered obedience to Allah and his messenger. While there are specific commandments mentioned in the Quran, there are also 200 mentions of the general commandment to do good and act charitably towards others and all of creation. Therefore, it is the responsibility of individuals to know what is just, fair, and benevolent and to implement these principles in their lives.
- **[00:20:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=emn9tgLENTA&t=1200)** In this section, Dr. Ovamir Anjum and Imam Tom Facchine discuss the concept of good and how it is communicated in the language Allah uses in Islamic texts. They acknowledge the importance of human discovery of right and wrong, as well as cultural sensitivities in ethical considerations. The Divine Law revealed through the Prophet is not arbitrary and is known to be good and bad. The commandments are not a test, but are commands that are good for us and can be known to be good. Islamic law and ethics are ultimately inseparable, as Allah commands only what is good for humans.
- **[00:25:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=emn9tgLENTA&t=1500)** In this section, Dr. Ovamir Anjum and Imam Tom Facchine discuss the three different camps of legislation in Islam: those that are exceptions, those that have a rationale behind them but a fixed form, and those that are intimately intertwined with reason and legislation to serve human good. They emphasize the importance of not swinging to either extreme of thinking that everything in Shariah is set in stone or that everything can be reformed and changed. They also discuss the role of Sufism in the cultivation of individuals who can act in an ethical way.
- **[00:30:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=emn9tgLENTA&t=1800)** In this section, the conversation revolves around Sufism and its legitimacy in the context of Sharia. The concept of makasid is explored, and it is acknowledged that it has been often used as an excuse to avoid fulfilling certain obligations. However, the first purpose of Sharia is to protect the Deen, and one ought to sacrifice oneself to protect it. The conversation then transitions to the difference between the discovery of right and wrong and the embodiment or inculcation of ethics, and how they are complementary. Finally, the history of Sufism is discussed, and it is pointed out that it emerged as one of many tazkia movements in Islam, such as the Malamathia and the sac and other traditions that preceded the Sophies.
- **[00:35:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=emn9tgLENTA&t=2100)** In this section, Dr. Ovamir Anjum discusses the history and evolution of Sufism and tazikia, which is a more general term for purification in Islam. The center of Sufism was in Baghdad, and it gave its name to the entire phenomenon of this gear in Islam. Though these terms are often used interchangeably, they have distinct differences. Tazikia applies to the relationship between the self and Allah, while Sufism pertains to the relationship between human beings and God's creation. The early subwoof was much more about the psychology of the relationship with Allah, and the way the creation of Allah. Later on, though, much of the concepts that became very popular when established in the domain of the subwoof was actually quite later.
- **[00:40:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=emn9tgLENTA&t=2400)** In this section, Dr. Ovamir Anjum and Imam Tom Facchine discuss the concept of self-evaluation and self-critique called muhasaba and its usefulness in the practice of Islam. They mention a book that was overly critical of people's inner states during prayer, causing people to lose hope in worshiping Allah. However, they emphasize that just because something is in the domain of tasawwuf or sufism, it does not mean it is above critique by the considerations of the Sharia. They conclude that self-evaluation is a legitimate ground upon which legitimate Sufism stands. The imperative to love Allah and worship him as if you see him is essential, and it is inevitable that Muslims will collect insights on how to practice Islam better.
- **[00:45:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=emn9tgLENTA&t=2700)** In this section, Dr. Ovamir Anjum and Imam Tom Facchine discuss how Islam views ethics compared to modern society. Anjum explains how the rise of secularism has led to a purely rational approach to determining what is right and wrong, while in the past, ethics were more centered around cultivating good habits. Anjum also introduces the concept of prophetic ethics in Islam, which focuses on modeling the behavior of prophets, including Prophet Muhammad, as they embody the first commandment of existence. Anjum argues that Islamic ethics should not be confined to just the Sharia but also engage with questions and traditions beyond it.
- **[00:50:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=emn9tgLENTA&t=3000)** In this section, Dr. Ovamir Anjum and Imam Tom Facchine discuss the separation of religion from ethics and how it is the essence of secularism. Anjum explains that secularism proposes a radical move that says one can be good without God, which makes it possible for people to question if those who do not believe in a religion, or reject God, can be good. Anjum states that this question is only possible to ask after secularism has done its work. He notes that this does not mean people who are not exposed to Islam cannot be good, but rather all the good that exists even outside of Islam builds on the character that exists, and ethics ultimately needs Islam, as you cannot have the idea of ethics without God who created the world.
- **[00:55:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=emn9tgLENTA&t=3300)** In this section, Dr. Ovamir Anjum and Imam Tom Facchine discuss the concept of ethics in society, emphasizing the importance of not abandoning the fundamental task of which life is created. They explain how skills and qualities of a society must not overshadow this fundamental task. They also discuss the need for the discipline of Ethics in Islamic jurisprudence, which focuses on cultivating good habits and developing a sense of gratitude in life. While Islamic jurists focus on texts and traditions, they may not always be equipped to direct and help others in the emotional and spiritual domains of life, which is where the discipline of ethics becomes necessary.

### [01:00:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=emn9tgLENTA&t=3600) - [01:45:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=emn9tgLENTA&t=6300)

Dr. Ovamir Anjum, Editor-in-Chief of Yaqeen Institute, discusses topics such as legalistic Islam, ethical dilemmas, and the significance of iron in technological advancements. He emphasizes the importance of knowledge in Islam and how it can be pursued ethically, while also acknowledging the need for repentance and redemption in the face of human error. Anjum discusses the process of publishing papers at the institute and the three main ingredients required for publication - academic rigor, value alignment, and the proper tone. He also explains the three levels of review that any paper goes through before it gets published, highlighting the importance of academic rigor and integrity. Finally, Anjum and Imam Tom Facchine discuss the evolution of Yaqeen Institute's strategy and its review process for published articles.

- **[01:00:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=emn9tgLENTA&t=3600)** In this section, Dr. Ovamir Anjum discusses modern concerns with legalistic Islam and how it is important to not dismiss them. While one could conceptually explain that Allah has commanded acts such as praying and doing good, some individuals may question where to learn about these behaviors, leading to a need for an ethics and a flock of marriage to understand marital behavior. Anjum explains that it is important to note the structure of these teachings and that the lack of knowledge in Islamic ethics could lead to a condemnation of Fick as legalistic. Additionally, Anjum touches on the idea that Muslims' reactions to their faith are heavily influenced by Christian structures and concepts, leading to misunderstandings about Islamic ethics.
- **[01:05:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=emn9tgLENTA&t=3900)** In this section, Dr. Ovamir Anjum and Imam Tom Facchine discuss the concept of beneficial knowledge in Islam. Anjum notes that the pursuit of knowledge in Islam implicitly recognizes that there is non-beneficial knowledge, and emphasizes the ethical way to interact with knowledge. They then address ethical dilemmas surrounding modern advancements such as testing on animals, pesticides and GMOs, atomic weapons, and AI. Anjum notes the profound nature of these questions and their metaphysical implications. He also reflects on the idea of Allah's infinite power and mystery as the reasons behind the creation of both beneficial and self-destructive human capacities.
- **[01:10:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=emn9tgLENTA&t=4200)** In this section, Dr. Ovamir Anjum and Imam Tom Facchine discuss the significance of iron and the technological advancements it brings, as well as the responsibility that comes with possessing such power. They argue that the current state of modern technology, particularly AI, is driven by a civilization that lacks intellectual and spiritual maturity. Islam, on the other hand, has the potential to provide a more ethical framework for pursuing knowledge and reigning in the pursuit of power. However, they also acknowledge the inevitability of human error and advocate for tawba, the act of repentance, as a means of redemption and moving forward. They conclude by discussing the yakin Institute and its role in producing knowledge with an emphasis on ethics and guidance for Muslims.
- **[01:15:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=emn9tgLENTA&t=4500)** In this section, Dr. Ovamir Anjum, Editor-in-Chief of Yaqeen Institute, discusses the process for publishing papers at the institute. He explains that their goal is to produce beautiful defenses of Islam that are grounded in modern concerns and not alienating. The process starts by a diverse group of researchers from Islamic Studies and social sciences, imams, and traditional experts getting together to determine the most urgent problems that the Muslim community faces. They collect data on what people are asking and struggling with and use that to guide their content. The recent focus has been on the integrity of family and community in the wake of extremism on both sides of the political spectrum in American culture.
- **[01:20:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=emn9tgLENTA&t=4800)** In this section, Dr. Ovamir Anjum and Imam Tom Facchine discuss the three main ingredients that are required for a paper to be published in the JAKIN Journal. The first is academic rigor and knowledge of the subject matter expertise, while the second is value alignment, as the authors should be committed to Islam and have Yakim. The third and final ingredient is the proper tone that can speak to the masses, which is often a significant challenge for Muslim academics who must be able to address misunderstandings about Islam and write in a way to encourage others to declare themselves as Muslims. The JAKIN Journal demands good research, value alignment, and the proper tone, which distinguishes it from other academic journals.
- **[01:25:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=emn9tgLENTA&t=5100)** In this section, Dr. Ovamir Anjum, the editor-in-chief of Yaqeen Institute, explains the three levels of review that any paper goes through before it gets published. The first is the editorial review, conducted by Dr. Anjum and his editorial team. Then, if the paper passes, it goes to two blind reviewers for a double blind process. Lastly, the paper is checked by ulama for its Islamic content, including Hadith and Quranic references. There is also a fourth layer, which is less review and more rewriting, where the content is kept, but the writing is improved. Dr. Anjum also explains that Yaqeen was born in the era when there were attacks on Islam and Muslims, and its mission was to provide clear and academic responses to those attacks. Since joining Yaqeen, Dr. Anjum has helped to bring a discursive tradition to the organization and promote more academic rigor.
- **[01:30:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=emn9tgLENTA&t=5400)** In this section, Imam Tom Facchine interviews Dr. Ovamir Anjum about the importance of bringing together both traditional Islamic scholarship and modern Western academic scholarship to better understand and respond to issues related to Islam. Dr. Anjum emphasizes the significance of knowing intellectual history and acknowledging modern Western scholarly objections in responding to modern issues. He also explains his involvement in Yaqeen Institute, an organization that aims to provide defense for Islam, and his efforts to slow down the publication process and focus on quality control and direction for the organization.
- **[01:35:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=emn9tgLENTA&t=5700)** In this section, Dr. Ovamir Anjum and Imam Tom Facchine discuss how Yaqeen Institute's role and responsibilities have evolved with time. Dr. Anjum explains that the organization initially started to address doubts about Islam created by outsiders, mainly through writing rebuttals. However, as Yaqeen grew, their focus expanded, and they had to adjust their research and understanding of Muslims to suit their new role as a source of guidance on Islam and its proper practice. They also explain that processes like blind reviews and Orthodoxy checks were not institutionalized in the initial stages. Still, as Yaqeen grew, they introduced them to maintain academic rigor and integrity.
- **[01:40:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=emn9tgLENTA&t=6000)** In this section, Dr. Ovamir Anjum and Imam Tom Facchine discuss the evolution of the Yaqeen Institute's strategy. They note that as the organization grew and gained a wider audience, there was increased pressure to have a more deliberate and constructive approach, rather than simply presenting multiple voices on an issue. The goal shifted towards clarifying and instilling certainty in Islamic positions, rather than complicating things. Anjum also discusses his role as editor-in-chief and his previous work on the editorial review board, where they established a process for handling objections or critiques of published articles.
- **[01:45:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=emn9tgLENTA&t=6300)** In this section, Dr. Ovamir Anjum and Imam Tom Facchine discuss the review process for articles that have been published on their website. Anjum explains that they have a detailed and robust review process that involves blind reviews and specific questions for reviewers to answer. Recommendations are made based on whether an article should be removed, kept, or kept for record-keeping purposes only. The review process is ongoing, and anyone can offer feedback or corrections. Anjum emphasizes that while they do not intend to remove every article that people may disagree with, there is an assessment of benefits and harms to determine whether to keep or remove an article.
