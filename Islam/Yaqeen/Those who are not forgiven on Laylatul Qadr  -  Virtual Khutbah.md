In this section, the speaker discusses the concept of Laylatul Qadr or the Night of Decree, which is the holiest night of the year in Islam. It is said that whoever observes this night with faith and accountability, seeking the reward of Allah, then all of their previous sins are forgiven. The speaker urges people to take advantage of this opportunity, as not doing so would be a violation of this blessed time. He draws a comparison to Hajj, the pilgrimage for Muslims, and how an accepted Hajj when done right does away with everything before it. Similarly, not doing anything to violate the sanctity of Laylatul Qadr is the key to receiving Allah's forgiveness. The speaker also highlights the importance of leaving off abusive language and harmful expressions during Ramadan, as it negates the very essence of fasting.

The speaker concludes by praying that Allah not only exempts us from being prayed against, but also makes us amongst those who are prayed for and receives his peace in these blessed nights.
