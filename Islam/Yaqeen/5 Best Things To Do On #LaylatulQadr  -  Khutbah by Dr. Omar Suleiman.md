In this section of the video, Dr. Omar Suleiman explains the five things that people should keep in mind during the last 10 nights of Ramadan, with a special emphasis on Laylatul Qadr. Firstly, people should remember that the night starts at Maghrib and not Isha, which means they need to be cautious of indulging in actions that are not pleasing to Allah at the time of breaking the fast. Secondly, it is important to pray Isha and Fajr in congregation within Jamaa, whether in a mosque or at home. Thirdly, whoever prays Qiyam with an Imam until he finishes will have the entire night counted as prayer. The fourth point is to read Surah Ikhlas, which is equal in reward to reciting one-third of the Quran, and lastly, people should give Sadaqah and help others during these sacred nights to increase their own rewards further.

In this section, Dr. Omar Suleiman explains that praying with an imam for an established prayer from the beginning of their qiyam until the end of their qiyam counts as the entire night of prayer. He also recommends keeping oneself busy in dura and short duas, even when moving around, as it is said to be the most beloved supplication to Allah. Finally, he emphasizes the importance of diversifying good deeds and assigning a share of one's salah to one's home to prevent it from becoming a grave. Each Muslim has something to give life to every part of the night, and all of the good deeds preferred in Ramadan are even more preferred in the last ten nights of Ramadan.
