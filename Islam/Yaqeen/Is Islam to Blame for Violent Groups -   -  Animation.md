# Summary of Is Islam to Blame for Violent Groups? | Animation

The idea that Islam is the cause of violent extremist groups is incorrect according to this video. Islam generally teaches peace and anti-violence, but violent groups arise from situations of oppression, political instability and prolonged suffering. For such groups to form, three ingredients are required: political instability, a brutalized population, and fanatical leaders with totalitarian ideologies. This has been particularly evident in the Middle East, where groups in Iraq were formed following the US invasion of 2003. These groups often use religious terms but assign new meanings, typically associated with violence and destruction. It is important to educate oneself so that these narratives of hate and xenophobia can be countered, and efforts put towards addressing injustice and suffering.

In this section, it is explained that the notion that Islam is to blame for violent groups is misguided. Islam's core teachings stress peace and anti-violence, but violent groups emerge in situations of oppression, political instability, and prolonged human suffering. Violent groups require three ingredients; political instability, a brutalized population, and fanatical leaders with totalitarian ideologies. In recent history, this is evident in the Middle East. Groups in Iraq emerged from a decade of oppressive regimes, economic sanctions, and the aftermath of the 2003 US invasion. Violent groups drew upon religious terms but gave them new meanings associated with destruction and violence. People who join these violent groups often lack basic familiarity with Islamic teachings. It is imperative to educate ourselves to counter narratives of hate and xenophobia and focus on finding solutions to injustice and suffering.
