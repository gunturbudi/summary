In this section, Dr. Omar Suleiman shares a personal experience of how bumping into an old friend at Niagara Falls reminded him of the transient nature of life. He then pivots to the concept of strangers and how the plural form in the Hadith emphasizes the existence of groups of people in every generation that are grounded in the purpose of adhering to Allah's principles. This reminds us that we are not alone in our journey and that there will always be others we can aspire to be like and cling to. There are forerunners and groups of people in every generation that emphasize the importance of the group in our journey of transition together.

In this section, Dr. Omar Suleiman emphasizes the importance of companionship and the value of having good companions. He shares a personal anecdote of his teacher who reached out to him to remind him of the importance of friendship and being there for each other. Dr. Suleiman then brings attention to the fact that throughout history, there have been many remarkable individuals, including prophets, whose examples we can learn from. In addition, their guidance is available in the form of books and through studying their lives, we can gain a sense of companionship even though they lived in the past. He stresses the importance of good company and how it can have a positive impact on one's life.

In this section of the lecture, Dr. Omar Suleiman emphasizes the importance of surrounding oneself with good company. He explains how a person's surroundings can deeply impact their own sense of right and wrong, and how being around good people can help one breathe easier and feel like they can strive to be better. He encourages the audience to compete with and complete one another for Allah's pleasure, and to look to the examples of the Prophet (SAWS) and his companions for guidance.

In this section, Dr. Omar Suleiman discusses the Hadith where the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) advises believers to be in this world as if they are a stranger or a Wayfarer, conveying a sense of urgency for believers. To be a stranger in this world doesn't mean to be someone disliked or marginalized, but to stand out and be unfamiliar with the ways of the world. Dr. Omar encourages striving for excellence, to aim for achieving the highest levels of righteousness, not necessarily to reach the rank of the Prophet or the sahaba but to manifest refined qualities pleasing to Allah, in the hopes of being amongst the forerunners of this generation. The Hadith also speaks to the importance of setting high standards, determining priorities in life, and moving with speed to achieve what really matters.

In this section, Dr. Omar Suleiman discusses the concept of being strange or a wayfarer in this world due to having different standards and principles. He explains that it is not about being objectionable in behavior, but rather one's substance and mission inherently puts them at odds with society around them. This was exemplified by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) who was considered strange because of his kindness and composure, which went against the norms of his society. Dr. Suleiman emphasizes that the strangeness is a result of one's insistence on their principles, not because of their disagreeable behavior, and that it changes with circumstances due to different people having different standards. Ultimately, being a wayfarer in this world and embracing one's differences is essential to fulfilling one's purpose in life.

In this section of the lecture, Dr. Omar Suleiman discusses the concept of piety and how it can lead to ostracization even amongst Muslims. He explains that a person of piety, who is more aware of the sight of God upon them, may relinquish certain sins that have become normalized amongst the community and may embark on a journey of God consciousness. However, when this person becomes uncomfortable with things that have been normalized, others may challenge them, asking who they think they are to challenge the community's culture and ideals. Dr. Suleiman suggests that, despite facing ostracization, those who embark on the journey of piety become strangers or wayfarers even amongst people of consciousness or excellence.

In this section, Dr. Omar Suleiman talks about the importance of having a high standard and constantly striving for excellence by competing with oneself. He stresses that Muslims should not be content with just being good but should push themselves to be the best they can be. He notes that the Prophet spoke about bringing about a good practice in Islam, where whoever does so has the reward of that Sunnah and everyone that follows it. He emphasizes the sense of urgency and importance of doing the consistent small things that are in front of us now to unlock the next degree of pursuit of Talib. The goal is to live a life with perspective, to be grateful for what we have, to be focused on our eternal pursuits and our eternal abode, and to have a greater pursuit and goal like the Prophet had.

In this section of the video, Dr. Omar Suleiman discusses a Hadith that mentions being in the world as if you are a stranger or a wayfarer. He explains that a wayfarer is someone who is in a place, does what they need to do, and leaves for their journey, while a stranger does not have a home or a family to host them. The function of being a wayfarer is to detach oneself from worldly possessions and to avoid becoming a materialist. The prophet Mohammed often advised those closest to him not to take too much from the world and to only take what is necessary for their journey. The key takeaway is to avoid becoming attached to worldly possessions and remain focused on seeking something greater.

In this section of the lecture, Dr. Omar Suleiman advises his listeners to live modestly and within their means. He notes that if worldly pursuits dominate one's concerns, then their concern for the hereafter will suffer as a result. This does not mean having less excellence but having perspective. He warns against becoming an extravagant person as it can cloud one's judgment and lead to materialism. He also encourages people to pursue excellence with their degree and career without being excessively attached to possessions and creating a temporary paradise with their wealth. Suleiman emphasizes the importance of discipline in automating one's habits, but passion is what will sustain one's drive.

00:45:00
In this section of the lecture, Dr. Omar Suleiman discusses the concept of The Stranger and how they perceive things that others don't. He relates this to the idea of belief in the Unseen and an unseen reward that is very real for those who dedicate themselves to Allah. He emphasizes that discipline is the automation of habit, and advocates for striving for excellence in all things. He ends this section by congratulating a brother who converted to Islam and encouraging the audience to make dua for him and his family.
