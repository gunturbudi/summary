In this section, Sheikh Omar Suleiman discusses the collection recently released, "More Than Just a Number", which aims to contextualize the age of Aisha bint Abu Bakr in a broader context using an interdisciplinary approach. He also explains that Aisha is known as "mother" and is as beloved to Muslims as their own biological mothers. Furthermore, Suleiman explains that for centuries there were no attacks on the Prophet Muhammad's character surrounding Aisha's age, and it has only recently become a favorite talking point of Islamophobes.

In this section, Sh. Omar Suleiman discusses the issue of Aisha's age at the time of her marriage to the Prophet Muhammad. He explains that modern-day criticism of the age gap between Aisha and the Prophet was not an issue in the past and is often used to portray Muslim men as violent and in need of restraint, while Muslim women are portrayed as needing rescue. Suleiman brings up examples of age gaps in other cultures and notes that the historical context of the time must be taken into account. He also highlights how these criticisms of the Prophet's character form part of a broader colonial project to attack Islam and pillage Muslim countries in the East.

In this section, the speaker explores why there is a problem with child marriage as it is viewed in today's society and how that perception is sometimes assigned to the context of the Prophet's time. He breaks down the physical, psychological, and power dynamic dimensions of child marriage and applies them to the case of Aisha (ra)'s marriage to the Prophet. He notes that Aisha (ra) had reached the age of maturity before entering the Prophet's household and possessed a confidence and love for him that did not fit the image that comes to mind when thinking of child marriage. The speaker suggests that we need to acknowledge our cultural conditioning and biases in order to better understand and interpret the practices of the past.

In this section, Sheikh Omar Suleiman addresses the power dynamic, education, and abuse in the marriage of the Prophet peace be upon him and Aisha may Allah be pleased with her. He highlights that despite the age difference, Aisha was a strong-willed woman who would challenge the Prophet peace be upon him and others in her society. Moreover, Aisha was the most knowledgeable of the wives of the Prophet peace be upon him and grew into being a great scholar in the Islamic tradition. Sheikh Omar Suleiman emphasizes that there was no abuse present in their marriage and Aisha may Allah be pleased with her even praised the Prophet peace be upon him for his good character.

00:20:00
In this section, Sheikh Omar Suleiman discusses the portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad's marriage to Aisha, specifically regarding her age. He emphasizes that throughout history, Muslim scholars have consistently placed safety protocols for marriage, and the age of marriage varies across different times and environments. Additionally, Aisha had nothing but praise for the Prophet's character and never hinted at any form of abuse or imbalance in their marriage, contrary to commonly held beliefs. Therefore, characterizing Aisha as a child is empirically wrong and inappropriate, and it is essential to engage in intelligent discourse when discussing these topics.

00:25:00
In this section, Sheikh Omar Suleiman sheds light on the engagement of Aisha to the Prophet peace be upon him, which helps clarify the controversy. Aisha was actually engaged before him, and she was engaged to Jebaited and Muhtaram, a man by the name of Jubei had been Muhtaram. Aisha was not sought out by the Prophet peace be upon him for marriage but instead suggested to him both by a human being and an angel in Djibouti Nadi his Salam. Aisha was introduced to the Prophet peace be upon him by a woman named Halima who was trying to get the Prophet remarried after he lost his only wife for the first 53 years of his life.

00:30:00
In this section, Sheikh Omar Suleiman discusses the engagement between Aisha and Jubayr, a man who later became a fierce enemy of Islam. Jubayr was engaged to Aisha, but when he found out that he would potentially become a Muslim, he ended the engagement. Abu Bakr, Aisha's father, then invited the Prophet Muhammad to his house where the engagement between Aisha and the Prophet Muhammad was established. Aisha describes the Prophet Muhammad as a beautiful, handsome, and pleasing man, whom she fell deeply in love with and was extremely protective of. Those who claim that Aisha was dehumanized in her marriage to the Prophet Muhammad are actually guilty of dehumanizing her themselves, as they reduce her to just a number, rather than acknowledging her entire life, character, and qualities, such as her eloquence and grammar.

00:35:00
In this section, Sheikh Omar Suleiman describes Aisha, the wife of the Prophet Muhammad, as one of the most knowledgeable and eloquent companions of the Prophet. He explains that Aisha was respected by both men and women, and was known for her vast knowledge in not just Islamic jurisprudence, but also in poetry, medicine, history, and ancestry. Aisha was also recognized for her ability to correct and challenge others' opinions and interpretations of texts. Overall, Aisha was seen as a giant and an ocean of knowledge, with her wisdom and intelligence being revered by many of the companions of the Prophet.

00:40:00
In this section, Sheikh Omar Suleiman explains why Aisha (ra) was revered in Islamic history. As the wife of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), Aisha had unparalleled knowledge and understanding of Islam, even among the male companions of the Prophet. Furthermore, she was unique in that she was the only woman to be solely married to the Prophet, and her authority and leadership were undisputed. Aisha played an instrumental role in narrating over 2,000 hadith, which gives us insight into the life of the Prophet (pbuh) as a husband and father. Despite sometimes portraying herself negatively in arguments with the Prophet (pbuh), Aisha did so to defend his supreme character, a fact that illustrates her dedication to teaching the principles of Islam to future generations.

00:45:00
In this section, Sheikh Omar Suleiman discusses the character of Aisha (ra) and her acts of charity. He cites various accounts of Aisha's immense generosity, highlighting how she would give away large sums of money and even her own food, leaving herself with nothing, just to help those in need. Aisha's acts of charity were a defining aspect of her character and served as a source of inspiration to others in the society of the Prophet (pbuh). Despite not being widely known for her charitable acts, Aisha's generosity and selflessness made her one of the greatest and most beloved female companions of the Prophet (pbuh).

00:50:00
In this section of the video, Sheikh Omar Suleiman talks about Aisha (ra) and her fasting, humility, and trust in Allah. He argues that reducing her to just a number in the debate about her age is a dehumanizing act. He also refutes the opinion that she was actually much older than commonly understood, stating that this idea is not grounded in reality but rather a confirmation bias. He notes that this opinion is as new as the criticism of the Prophet peace be upon him for marrying her at a young age, and that it goes against the religious knowledge and anthropology studies of the time.

00:55:00
In this section, Omar Suleiman explains that the discourse over Aisha's age is a contemporary and minority view that arises from implicit evidence, against explicit evidence to the contrary. However, there are some thinkers out there that throw doubt on the entire existence of hadith in order to prove their point, which is a much bigger problem compared to believing that Aisha was older than what we find in the narrations. Entertaining discourse about her age is okay, so long as it doesn't uproot the tradition as a whole, but still recognizes that the majority opinion is so, as Aisha's age was never an issue in the past. Aisha's legacy, contribution to Islam, marraige to Prophet Muhammad, knowledge, and wisdom are much more important, and she was a saint, a sage, and a scholar, and that should be the focus of discourses surrounding her.
