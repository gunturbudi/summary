# Summary of The LGBTQ Question: What Does Islam Say? - Dr. Omar Suleiman

Dr. Omar Suleiman discusses the Islamic ruling on LGBTQ issues, stating that any sexual relationship outside of marriage between a man and a woman and same-sex actions are forbidden. However, Muslims should not be ostracized by their desires, and the one who acts upon those desires is sinful but can still be within the fold of Islam. Muslims should not support what Allah has prohibited but also condemn mistreatment or violence against people on this basis. Instead, they should continue to be good neighbors and colleagues, show the beauty of the prophetic way with their character, and anchor their understanding of any issue in the Quran, Sunnah, and the scholars.
