In this section, Sh. Omar Suleiman discusses the importance of tests and trials faced by Ibrahim alayhis salam. He notes that without these trials and the way in which Ibrahim handled them, many of the reasons for his honor and celebrations would not exist in the Quran and in our history. The Hajj is a commemoration of Ibrahim alayhis salam and each member of his family has a unique perspective on the trials and tribulations that they faced. Sh. Suleiman focuses on the perspective of Hajar and how her intervention into the story of Ibrahim is unique among the stories of the prophets in the Quran.

In this section, the focus is on the story of Hajar, a woman from Muscle who had a very different experience than the Prophet. She was put at the mercy of Prophet Ibrahim and his wife and then put into a spiral of uncertainty where she had to figure things out along the way. Her legacy is celebrated today, as she is honored like no other woman in history, with people constantly commemorating her patience and her rituals. The Pharaoh of Muscle had taken two attractive women by killing their husbands and approached Sarah, the wife of Prophet Ibrahim, who he believed was his sister. Sarah called upon Allah to protect her from the Pharaoh, who was overcome by paralysis when he approached her. He did this three times until he called his guards and got rid of Sarah, having referred to her as a devil.

In this section, the story of Hajar, a slave girl in the palace of the Pharaoh, is discussed. After Pharaoh becomes afraid of Hajar's harm, he gives her to Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) as a reward or compensation and orders his departure. Hajar travels with Ibrahim and his family, where she observes the belief of the Prophet and his wife Sarah, and eventually becomes a believer herself. Later on, she becomes Ibrahim's wife and gives birth to their son Ismail. After experiencing difficulties in settling in Mecca, Ibrahim leaves them with some dates, water, and faith in Allah's command, before departing again.

In this section of the video, the story of Hajar and Ibrahim (AS) is narrated, where Hajar is left in the desert with their child after Ibrahim (AS) is commanded by Allah to do so. As he walks away, Hajar asks him if Allah commanded this and he nods in affirmation, leaving her with complete trust in Allah. Hajar's statement that "Allah does not lose his people" embodies the concept of having good expectations of Allah and being conscious of Him, which the Prophet (SAW) proclaimed as the way Allah treats His servants. The story demonstrates that Allah always provides for His people in ways they could not imagine.

In this section of the lecture, Sh. Omar Suleiman tells the story of Hajar and her complete trust in Allah when stranded in the desert with her child. As she runs out of water, she remains certain that Allah will provide for her, and he does through the miraculous appearance of Zam Zam water. Later, the prophet Muhammad stands in the same spot of suffer where Hajar was stranded and where he was initially rejected as a prophet and watches thousands of believers surround him. Through Hajar's story, the prophet's struggle, and ultimate triumph, Sh. Suleiman emphasizes the importance of having certainty in Allah regardless of the situation.

In this section, Sheikh Omar Suleiman discusses the story of Hajar, the wife of Prophet Ibrahim and how she showed extraordinary patience and reliance on Allah in times of hardship. She was sent to live in a desert with her infant son without any provisions. When she ran out of water, she searched for help and found the well of Zamzam, which was a reward from Allah for her unwavering faith. This story shows that no matter what circumstance one may be in, as long as Allah is with them, they will never be lost. The lesson from this and other prophet's stories is that Allah is always with us and will never abandon us, so we should not lose hope in difficult times.
