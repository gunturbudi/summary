In this section, the speaker recounts the story of Imam Ahmed and the man who instigated his torture, Ibn Abidu'ad. Though the two men were once in similar positions, their funerals could not have been more different. Ahmed was honored with the largest janazah ever known to the Arabs and millions of people poured in from all over to attend. In contrast, Ibn Abidu'ad was a rotten corpse with no one to even pray janaza on him because they hated him for the harm that he had caused. The speaker notes that the weight of testimony is significant when it comes to determining one's place in the afterlife, and that those who encountered you the most, such as family and friends, will likely have the most to say about you. However, even something as small as relieving the debts of others or covering the faults of a brother or sister can have a positive impact and be remembered as a good deed on Judgment Day.

In this section of the video, the speaker discusses the various ways in which one can help others and be rewarded in the afterlife. Small acts of kindness, such as releasing someone from a transaction they regret, can also be rewarded by Allah. Additionally, freeing a believing slave is considered an even greater act of goodness, one that can lead Allah to free the doer of the act from punishment. The speaker reminds us that the positive effects of our actions can extend far beyond our own lifetimes, as future generations can benefit from institutions we helped to build or sadaqah that we gave. Finally, the speaker explains that good deeds we were not even aware of can testify on our behalf on the Day of Judgment, showing the importance of doing good for its own sake.
