In this section, the lecturer discusses the historical events that led to the death of religion in the West, starting with Martin Luther's protest against indulgences and the Pope's authority in 1517, which eventually led to the Protestant Reformation. He goes on to describe how Galileo's scientific discoveries in 1642 were interpreted by the church as a heresy and led to his house arrest. The lecturer then moves on to the Enlightenment period and how Denis Diderot professed religion to be nothing but a scam used by the governments to keep the Kings in power. The anti-religious sentiment reached its peak with the publication of the communist manifesto in 1848, declaring religion to be the opium of the masses. The lecturer highlights that Islam's emphasis on knowledge and critical thinking negated the need for any such crossroads in Islamic thought, as Islam was never in conflict with modernity or progress.
