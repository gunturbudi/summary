In this section of the video, Dr. Omar Suleiman highlights the connection between the story of Adam and the first people, the immediate ummah, and the people of Israel in the Quran. He notes that Allah often gives a picture of an individual and then a picture of a people, and emphasizes how Allah advises Israel to seek aid in the journey of life with patience and prayer, and to be certain of their return to their Lord. Dr. Suleiman also discusses how Allah bestowed blessings upon Adam and bani Israel, and encourages us to understand that our ultimate destination and destiny is returning to Allah.

In this section of the video, Dr. Omar Suleiman discusses the importance of controlling our desires as a way to reach Jannah. He notes that while Adam made a mistake and returned to Allahâ€™s favor, Bani Israel continuously distance themselves from Allah, ignoring the blessings upon them and hastening towards disobedience. Dr. Suleiman suggests that it is easier to turn despondence and despair into a connection to Allah while facing a trial than when the world has opened its doors to you. He says that hardships are gifts in disguise that allow one to focus once again and recalibrate on Jannah, thus an opportunity to nurture a relationship with Allah. By preparing oneself for tribulation and having patience at the first strike, it allows for materialization of this trait in the ultimate trial of death, where the words 'to Allah we belong, and to Allah, we shall return' gains weight and reward, granting one entry into Jannah.

The angels boast about those who remember Allah during these trials, and those who maintain patience are rewarded with high, lofty rooms in Paradise. Dr. Suleiman emphasizes the importance of not compromising our rewards during difficulties by saying or doing something wrong. Seeking refuge in Allah during moments of anger also brings great reward.
