The Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught that a leader is supposed to be a servant to the people, and that it is more beneficial for the leader to suffer with the people than to sit in luxury. He also demonstrated this principle by doing more manual labor than anyone else while living under constant threat of attack.

The video introduces Ali ibn Abi Talib, a man of incredible courage and strength who said that when the battle got rough, he would take refuge behind the Prophet Muhammad. The Prophet would then charge forward and never flee the battlefield. In Hunayn, Ali was one of six people who did not desert the battlefield, even when they were on a mule. After the battle, the Prophet would go and check on everyone, pray for the deceased, and console the families. Ali says that the Prophet's courage is an example for us to follow.
