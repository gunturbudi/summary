In this section, Sheikh Mikaeel Ahmed Smith discusses emotional intelligence and how it has shifted the traditional understanding of intelligence. He explains the acronym RULER, which stands for recognizing emotions, understanding emotions, labeling emotions, expressing emotions, and regulating emotions. He highlights that expression is embodied in a famous narration where the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) cried when his son or grandson died, thus demonstrating that crying is a valid form of emotional expression. Additionally, Sheikh Mikaeel emphasizes that anger is not necessarily a negative emotion when expressed in the right way, as it can bring about positive change.

In this section, the speaker discusses the importance of regulating emotions, as exemplified by the Prophet Muhammad's ability to express emotions while also exercising restraint and control. The speaker points out that it is important for individuals to express their emotions, but to also regulate them with the help of their intellect, as the intellect functions as a guiding light in understanding situations properly. By regulating emotions and taking a pause before reacting to stimuli, individuals can choose how to respond in the best possible manner. The speaker provides an example of the Prophet's ability to control his emotions when he was physically assaulted by a Bedouin and chose to respond calmly and with restraint.

In this section of the video, Mikaeel Ahmed Smith discusses emotional intelligence and its correlation to moral intelligence. Emotional intelligence is a tool for change where one can learn to recognize, understand, label, express and regulate their emotions both intrapersonally (within oneself) and interpersonally (with others). By knowing oneself, one can then effectively understand and relate to others, as exemplified by the Prophet Muhammad who managed the Arabs at a time when they were like wild beasts and managed to turn them into leaders of the world. Mikaeel notes that emotional intelligence can be used for positive purposes such as influencing people's hearts, but it can also be used negatively for manipulation and exploitation.

In this section, Mikaeel Ahmed Smith discusses the connection between moral and emotional intelligence, explaining that emotional intelligence is the tool by which knowledge of revelation is passed on to the next heart. He emphasizes that moral intelligence needs to be passed on to another human being with emotional intelligence, and this is how we understand the nature of human beings and change in them. Smith stresses the importance of understanding human beings and using emotional intelligence to master the art of passing on moral intelligence to another person's heart. He uses examples from the Hadith, such as how the revelations against alcoholism and adultery came after the small surahs about Hellfire and Judgement.

In this section of the video, the speaker talks about how the emotional aspect of Islamic education has been neglected, and how this has resulted in children feeling resentful towards the Quran. He talks about how some teachers have treated children poorly, resulting in the children developing a negative connection towards the Quran. He emphasizes the importance of emotional intelligence in Muslim men and the need to connect with others on an emotional level, pointing out that this is a prophetic aspect, not just a "fluffy psychological da da da da Western" one, and how the Prophet understood and recognized Aisha's emotions. He challenges Muslim educators to train and educate their children for their own time, using emotional nourishment to understand their needs.

In this section, Mikaeel Ahmed Smith discusses the importance of emotional intelligence and the power of emotions. He shares a story of his teacher's teacher who once called him close enough to hug him, revealing that love is the secret of religion. Smith also talks about the three parts of the brain, namely the pig brain (always fearful, always desiring food security), the dog brain (a sense of emotions), and the faculty of intelligence and emotion that discerns falsehood from truth. To foster better relationships in the workplace and in marriage, Smith suggests maximizing emotional intelligence and learning to read between the lines of what others are saying. He also mentions Hafiz's poem about taking a long journey and sitting still for three days to discover oneself.

In this section, Mikaeel Ahmed Smith discusses the importance of emotional intelligence in relationships on a friend-to-friend and brother-to-brother level. He highlights the significance of recognizing and understanding pain to alleviate it, and emphasizes the role of physical touch in conveying emotions. The biggest sensory organ of the body is skin, and physical touch can convey a lot of information. Smith stresses the prophesied uses of hugs, handshakes, and pats on the chest. Positive touch promotes deep connections, and certain cultures practice more positive touching than others. Smith presents studies on the dopamine release through skin-to-skin contact, and how physical touch can aid in therapeutic practices.

00:35:00
In this section, Mikaeel Ahmed Smith discusses the practice of skin-to-skin contact for newborns and its pricing in America. He argues that this practice should be done regardless of the cost because of the connection it allows between mother and child. He also emphasizes the importance of physical touch in emotional intelligence, citing Prophet Muhammad's habit of touching those around him and his advice to shake hands to remove hatred and animosity. Mikaeel emphasizes the role of physical touch in breaking cycles of distance with one's children and expresses hope that future scientific discoveries on the topic will further confirm its importance.

00:40:00
In this section, Mikaeel Ahmed Smith discusses the importance of presence in achieving emotional intelligence. He emphasizes that being present in the moment is what makes us truly human, and that we should not just live through moments, but truly experience them. Smith argues that witnessing and recognizing something is the greatest act a person can do, and that one cannot be a witness if their mind is not fully present in that moment. He encourages listeners to be mentally present in every moment and to not constantly be focused on the next moment, as this is what leads to a lack of true experiences and memories at the end of our lives.

00:45:00
In this section, Mikaeel Ahmed Smith discusses the importance of mindfulness and emphasizes how much life is wasted by not being present in every moment. He shares a story about a friend's grandfather who preferred his company over him doing things for him. Smith also talks about how children and elderly people can help individuals learn the value of being present. He stresses that every moment has infinite potential and that being mindful doesn't necessarily mean slowing down. He highlights the importance of slowing down periodically and practicing mindfulness, which can be done by practicing presence during the five daily prayers. Furthermore, Smith emphasizes the significance of having deep self-reflection and recognizing the difference between living through life and living in life. Lastly, he asserts that every breath is a spiritual experience, and people must stop and think about it.

00:50:00
In this section, Mikaeel Ahmed Smith provides some practical steps for mastering emotional intelligence. He suggests removing distractions from life as much as possible and bringing your mind to what you're experiencing in your body at the moment to practice mindfulness. According to Smith, Ramadan is a neurological reboot for mindfulness, presence, and intention. It's supposed to break habits so that you can bring back the habits you want in your life. Smith believes that learning to live in the moment is crucial, and Islam has already given the answers to this if you practice it the right way.

00:55:00
In this section, the speaker talks about the importance of making everyone feel loved, taking inspiration from how the Prophet Muhammad made everyone feel loved. He emphasizes the need for people to feel like they are loved the most, and hopes that listeners can manifest this in their lives. The section concludes with gratitude for the discussion and the hope that it was beneficial to the listeners.
