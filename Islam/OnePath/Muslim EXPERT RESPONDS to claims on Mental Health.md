In this section, Dr. Rania Awad explains that the Prophet Muhammad was in tune with his emotions and experienced grief and sorrow himself. Through his example, Muslims learn to depend on Allah to guide them through periods of difficulty and tribulation. Mental health issues are complex and can arise from a variety of factors, including biological and genetic influences, and cannot simply be attributed to a lack of faith and spirituality. Understanding and addressing mental health requires a holistic approach that takes into account the biological, psychological, and social factors that contribute to mental illness.

In this section, the speaker talks about how mental health issues can arise from environmental, social, or religious factors. While some people may experience depression or anxiety due to genetics or biology, others might experience it due to factors such as personal trauma, war, or a weakening of faith. It is important not to judge others for their mental health conditions and instead focus on seeking assessment and treatment. The speaker also emphasizes the importance of seeking out treatments for anxiety and stress, including therapy and advice from knowledgeable professionals, who are trained to help deal with these challenging circumstances.

In this section, the speaker states that seeking knowledge on how to deal with emotional stress as a person of faith can be beneficial. Mental conditions are multi-factorial, and the help of medical professionals and knowledgeable religious leaders may be required to work through them. The speaker also notes that incorporating one's Deen (faith) in the healing process is important, and that verses from the Quran and Hadith can help with the process. The story of the Prophet Muhammad losing his son indicates that it is normal to experience emotions such as sorrow during hardship and loss, but acceptance of fate and help from God can allow one to heal and get better.

In this section, the Muslim expert discusses three tips from religion to protect mental health. The first tip is to understand Allah and where we are in relation to Him, by knowing Allah through his many attributes and names that speak to us. The second tip is to accept the decree of Allah, remembering that Allah has predetermined our life, and realizing that no one can harm us except by Allah's decree, bringing our anxieties back to real size. The third tip is to have forbearance in dealing with the difficulties in life that were decreed, knowing that it is part of our journey and struggle to have patience and endure them.

In this section, the Muslim expert talks about how to deal with friends and family members who are struggling with mental health issues. She advises that we should inspire our loved ones to get help and reminds us that we cannot push someone who doesn't want to be helped. She suggests leveraging the help of others and inspiring through religious conversations or by making simple phone calls with their permission. If all fails, we should get help for ourselves at the end of the day. The expert also addresses how parents can develop good mental health practices for their young children and emphasizes that children model exactly what we teach them.

In this section, the expert discusses the importance of taking care of one's own mental health in order to take care of the mental health of children and young adults. In Islam, the preservation of one's intellect, body, and self is a foundational principle, and it becomes an obligation to do so. If adults in a young person's life are not taking care of themselves mentally, they become a barrier for the young person to seek mental health help and prevent them from healing. This journey of healing is something that is considered Islamic since it is part of the tradition's core values.
