The contingency argument states that for dependent things to exist, there must be a necessary existence or independent thing. Without the necessary existence, nothing contingent could exist, establishing a need-based relationship where submission is required. While the argument doesn't provide 99 attributes of God, the Quran and the Sunnah provide most attributes. Establishing the truth of the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ as the true Prophet of God, the argument affirms that anything from the Quran must be true, particularly in regards to God's nature.

In this section, the contingency argument is explained as the postulation that there cannot be a world with dependent things depending upon dependent things ad infinitum, with the entailment of such agreement being the need for a necessary existence or an independent thing. Dependency is defined as something that relies on something else for its existence, whereas independence is something that is self-sufficient and requires nothing else in order to exist. While the argument aims to bring someone from the state of agnosticism or atheism to a state of deism or theism or classical theism, it doesn't claim to give 99 attributes of God, and most attributes of God are actually found out through the textual proof, which is the Quran and the Sunnah.

In this section, the speaker argues that without the necessary existence, nothing contingent could exist or occur, therefore, anything we do is with the permission of the necessary existence by necessity. This establishes a need-based relationship, and submission to this necessity is crucial. Once pre-eternity, post-eternity, self-sufficiency, and oneness are established, the argument paves the way for the truth of the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ as the true Prophet of God. Consequently, anything that comes from the Quran must be true, especially in reference to the nature of God.
