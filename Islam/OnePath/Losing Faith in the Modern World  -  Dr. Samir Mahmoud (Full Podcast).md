In this section, Dr. Samir Mahmoud provides an overview of post-modernism, which is characterized by a distrust of grand narratives, a questioning of the foundations of knowledge, and a rejection of absolute truth. He explains that post-modernism emerged after the failure of the modernist project, which aimed to base human existence exclusively on human reason, detached from tradition, morality, and God. The failure of this project led to a moment of self-doubt in Europe, which ushered in a period of questioning and resistance in the 1960s. Post-modernism is a reaction against the certainty of the modern project and its exclusive reliance on human reason.

In this section, Dr. Samir Mahmoud discusses post-modernism and its rejection of absolute truth and moral certainty, instead promoting moral relativism and subjectivity. He believes this rejection of objective standards for what is right and wrong has led to the increasing centering of human thought and action on the individual, resulting in the birth of individualism. Dr. Samir also explains the Islamic tradition's understanding of the human being, with the rule descending from Allah and becoming embodied in a body called the Nafs, distinct from the material world.

00:10:00
In this section, Dr. Samir Mahmoud discusses the Islamic tradition of self-improvement and the different levels of the nafs or soul. He explains that in order to develop on the journey to Allah, one requires a path and guidance, which is provided by the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad's example. The Islamic tradition is rich in terms of the purification of the nafs, which allows individuals to re-actualize the purity of the soul. However, the problem with modernity is that it tries to chart the path of self-development on its own terms, cut off from God and the wisdom of tradition, which leads to an illusion of defining truth, good, and beautiful according to one's subjective morality.

00:15:00
In this section, Dr. Samir Mahmoud discusses the problem with individualism and subjectivity in the modern world. In the Islamic tradition, one aligns themselves with Revelation as a measure of truth and something higher than the self. However, without aligning with something higher, an individual's only criteria is turning inward and how they feel about things. This subjectivism provides hardly objective criteria for whether something is right or wrong. The Islamic tradition believes the self is not solely what the individual makes it out to be. The individual's idea of themselves is a combination of a long tradition of turning inward towards subjectivity.  Instead, the Islamic tradition believes the self is created upon a certain disposition, a primordial nature. If one veers off that path, one experiences psychological health, misery, and pain, leading to Contemporary pathologies of the modern world. Dr. Mahmoud goes on to explain that we cannot fully define who we are, but we can navigate the space by aligning with higher values, remaining faithful to our own tradition, and avoiding the traps of modernity.

In this section, Dr. Samir Mahmoud discusses the concept of "rooted revival" and how it applies to the modern world. He notes that in order to revive traditions, it must be rooted in the classical principles of the tradition to be successful. He compares the current reaction to modernity with the reaction of Muslim scholars in the late 19th and early 20th century, who initially thought that technology and science could be adopted without taking into account the embedded values of modernity. Dr. Mahmoud emphasizes the importance of being rooted in the Islamic tradition and understanding the essence of the modern world. He discusses the lack of a metaphysical and intellectual tradition amongst the youth, leaving them ill-equipped to evaluate the ideas they are drawn to, such as critical theory and gender theory. Dr. Mahmoud warns of "accepting everything that comes with it," and the importance of being classically trained to have the correct tools and a broad metaphysical framework to make sense of the world.

00:25:00
In this section, the speakers discuss how the absence of a larger framework can lead youth to be drawn into one ideology after another, leading to serious detrimental effects. They mention the rise of cancel culture, how the subjective self is being worshiped like an idol, and the severance between an individual's intrinsic essence and their feelings as key factors leading to this trend. The speakers argue that Muslims need to offer an alternative to this cultural phenomenon instead of engaging in debates between left and right. They believe Muslims should have more guidance and guidelines from Allah and be able to discern right from wrong.

00:30:00
In this section, Dr. Samir Mahmoud discusses the disconnection of humans from nature in the post-modern era and its implications on our relationship with Allah. Mahmoud argues that humans are born with a predisposition towards Allah, and that the fitra is a primordial, natural way of being that must be nurtured. He explains that Islam is a return to the primordial fitra that underpins all human beings and that every aspect of our tradition is closely tied to primordial patterns of nature. He encourages Muslims to follow the Sunnah as a way of life in the modern world that keeps us closely aligned with nature and its rhythms so that our relationship with nature is never mediated through technology.

00:35:00
In this section, Dr. Samir Mahmoud discusses the importance of maintaining a connection with nature and the natural world in order to maintain a healthy relationship with Allah. He believes that modern life, with its focus on technological advancements and insular discourse, has severed this relationship and become deeply problematic. Dr. Mahmoud encourages Muslims to engage with issues and concerns of the modern world and present Islamic solutions, as there is a need for an alternative for humanity to rectify global issues. By doing so, Muslims can help solve problems not only within their own community but globally as well.

00:40:00
In this section, Dr. Samir Mahmoud discusses the problem of postmodernism, which is not just a Western issue but one that affects Muslims as well. Muslims are rarely strictly traditional or modern, but rather fall somewhere in between. Dr. Mahmoud argues that Muslims must strive to embody the quality of compassion, which is a central principle in the Quran and was exemplified by the Prophet Muhammad. The Islamic Sharia, unlike other religious traditions, is not merely a set of constructed do's and don'ts, but guidelines that reorient individuals towards their intrinsic purpose. The idea of Halal captures this essence, as it requires individuals to consider animal welfare and invoke a state of compassion when killing the animal.

00:45:00
In this section, Dr. Samir Mahmoud discusses how Muslims have become too focused on demanding their rights as a minority, rather than focusing on their universal human rights. He argues that the whole tradition of Islam is based on human rights and intrinsically natural behavior, evidenced by the Quran's references to the natural world and the Prophet's establishment of Hammas natural reserves. He also emphasizes the importance of designing Islamic structures and buildings that reflect the principles Muslims want to live by, such as peace, harmony, and tranquility, and treating even sacred substances like water with dignity and respect. By positioning themselves as therapists to modern plagues and connecting with nature, Muslims can find common ground with others and have a more interesting conversation about the benefits of Sharia.

00:50:00
In this section, Dr. Samir Mahmoud discusses the importance of natural sanctuaries and gardens in the modern world and how they allow for dawah or the immersion of oneself in nature, ultimately guiding us to Allah. He addresses the issue of seclusion vs. engagement and suggests a combination of both at various moments and periods in one's life. The greatest spiritual experiences come from moments of stillness and tranquility, and while occasional retreats are necessary, it is important to maintain one's responsibilities towards others, particularly family members. The conversation also touches on the convergence of factors that make Italy an ideal place for educational and spiritual trips.

00:55:00
In this section, Dr. Samir Mahmoud discusses the importance of removing oneself from daily routines and taking time to contemplate and process experiences. He explains that it takes up to five or six days of travel to remove oneself from the mental and psychological habits of daily life and begin to experience something different. Dr. Mahmoud also emphasizes the need for extended periods of stillness to allow for contemplation, which he describes as the most profound movement of the soul. He advises against rushing around and checking messages, even on a retreat, as this is not how we are built as human beings.
