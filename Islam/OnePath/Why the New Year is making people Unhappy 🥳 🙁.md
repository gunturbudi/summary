New Year's Day is a day of hope and motivation for some, but also of self-reflection and self-accountability which can be difficult for some people. For Muslims, it is a day of Mahasabha, or self-accountability and reflection. The Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) noted that the one who practices Mahasabha regularly is from the intelligent and wise. There is a clear difference between achieving success based on luck or chance, and achieving success through Allah's decree, Qadar.
