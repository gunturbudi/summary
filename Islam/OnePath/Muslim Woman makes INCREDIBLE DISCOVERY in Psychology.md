A Muslim woman reveals her incredible discovery in psychology when researching the works of early Muslim scholars on mental illness. She stumbled upon a ninth-century book called "Masalih Al-Abdan wal Anfus," partly translated as "Sustenance of the Soul," which discussed physical and mental illnesses, including a chapter that resembled obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in modern psychology. She found that the criteria for OCD in the book matched those in the DSM 5, showing how early Muslim scholars were at the forefront of the mental health field. She also discusses the historical importance of Bimaristans, which were institutions of healing that offered holistic treatments for illnesses of the body and mind, using all of the senses to treat patients. The speaker expresses a hope for Muslims to revive this legacy, reclaim their heritage, and rewrite the narrative that has written Muslims out of the history of psychology.

In this section, the speaker discusses her discovery of a book from the ninth century by Abu Zayd Al-Balkhi called "Masalih Al-Abdan wal Anfus" which is partly translated as "Sustenance of the Soul." She found this book by looking through the works of the early Muslim scholars who had written about psychology and searched for what they understood about mental illness. The book's second half writes about physical and mental illnesses, and one of the chapters resembles obsessive-compulsive disorder, or OCD. She then took up the challenge of translating and comparing this with the DSM 5 and found that Al-Balkhi's criteria for OCD matched with it. Her professor advised her to publish the paper, which has now been published in the Journal of Affective Disorders. This work clearly shows how the early Muslim scholars were at the forefront of the mental health field and took significant steps towards its treatment and benefits, and Muslims should take pride in their rich medical heritage.

In this section, a Muslim woman discusses the origin of psychology and mental health treatment in Islamic history and how early Muslim scholars derived their interest in understanding the human psyche directly from the Quran and Sunnah. In contrast to modern psychology, which primarily focuses on empirical and cognitive and behavioral sciences, Islamic scholars took a more holistic approach that incorporated the biological, social, environmental, rational, empirical, and spiritual to develop a comprehensive treatment system for illnesses of both the body and mind. Early Muslim hospitals, or Bimaristans, included psychiatric institutions, making them the very first hospitals in history to offer mental health treatment.

In this section, the speaker talks about the historical importance of Maristans, which were institutions of healing that offered treatment for physical and mental illnesses, talk therapies, medications, spiritual therapies, and sound therapies. These institutions were holistic in their approach, using all of the senses to treat patients. Unfortunately, many factors, including colonization and political instability, have led to the loss of these institutions, and the legacy and heritage they represent. The speaker expresses a hope that Muslims will revive this legacy, reclaim their heritage, and rewrite the narrative that has written Muslims out of the history of psychology.
