In this section, Assim al hakeem, a scholar, explains that niqab, which is a face veil, is obligatory according to the most authentic opinion of scholars. Allah commands the mothers of believers in surah ahzab, verse 53, to communicate from behind a hijab, which means a screen or veil. It is the consensus of all scholars of Muslims that the wives of the Prophet must cover their faces, which is also supported by the Quran in surah ahzab, verse 59, where three types of women are commanded to lower their garments so that they are not recognized. The ruling of the Quran and Sunnah is that niqab is an obligation, and the face of a woman is her identity, which includes features of beauty and expressions, and should be covered.
