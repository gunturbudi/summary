In this section, Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem discusses whether applying perfume that contains alcohol and praying with it is permissible from an Islamic perspective. The sheikh explains that alcohol is a contentious issue among scholars who differ on whether it is physically or only spiritually impure. He notes that the evidence regarding the impurity of wine, which contains alcohol, is ambiguous and can be interpreted in different ways. Therefore, scholars who consider it pure base their argument on the fact that gambling, which is also prohibited, is not considered impure. They argue that alcohol is not physically impure, but it is prohibited because of its association with wine, which is considered harmful. The sheikh concludes that applying perfume with alcohol is permissible as long as it is not consumed, and it does not affect one's purity for prayer.
