Assim al Hakeem discusses the concept of taraweeh being an innovation (bid'ah) in Islam in this video. He argues that taraweeh is not an innovation because Prophet Muhammad initiated the Sunnah, and the Hadith authenticates this. Although Umar ibn al-Khattab added the practice of leading taraweeh to the Congregational Prayer, it is not a form of religious innovation because the Prophet had already initiated this practice. The term bid'ah refers to innovations mistakenly seen as religious obligations, and that is not the case with taraweeh.

In this section, Assim al Hakeem refutes the idea that taraweeh is an innovation in Islam, or a bid'ah. He explains that Prophet Muhammad himself initiated the Sunnah and the Hadith authenticates this, as the Prophet prayed taraweeh prayer leading the Companions for three or four nights, then he stopped. After the Prophet died, Umar ibn al-Khattab realized that what the Prophet had feared, obligating night prayer, no longer existed. Hence, he ordered Ubay ibn Ka'b to lead taraweeh in congregation. Although it was something new, it is not a form of religious innovation because the Prophet initiated this practice, and "bid'ah" refers to innovations mistakenly seen as religious obligations.
