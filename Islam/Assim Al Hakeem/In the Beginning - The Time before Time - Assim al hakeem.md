In this section, the speaker begins by discussing how the Quran is considered the ultimate book that contains all the necessary information about Islam and provides clarification for all things related to religion, Sharia, and Islam. He explains how Allah revealed the Quran to tell us about our existence, how things happened, and where we come from, and that all we need to know about Islam is found in the Quran. However, he notes that Allah does not speak about things that do not matter and provides an example of how Ibrahim attempted to prove to his people that stars were not gods but did not give a specific planet's name because it does not hold any value to our religion.

In this section, Assim al hakeem talks about how Allah has completed the religion and Prophet Muhammad is the seal of prophethood. He mentions that in the time of the Prophet, companions used to do things that were not from the Sunnah, but the Prophet did not stop them because those actions were not innovations in religion. However, nowadays, people do not have the right to innovate in religion. Assim al hakeem says that it is not permissible to create new forms of worship or ask about things that have been completed in religion. He emphasizes that acts of worship should only be directed towards Allah and not towards any other dignitaries.

In this section, Assim al hakeem discusses the topic of the time before time and provides insight from a hadith. The hadith states that there was nothing but Allah, and His throne was over the water, and He wrote everything in the book and created the heavens and the earth. All creatures acknowledge the existence of Allah, and this is the challenge that Allah gives to atheists. This hadith brings understanding to the origin of everything and the power of Allah. Finally, al hakeem emphasized that no matter how strong, wealthy or powerful we may be, we are nothing without Allah, even breathing is not in our control.

00:15:00
In this section, Assim Al-Hakeem discusses the concept of Allah's creation and attributes, focusing on the beginning of time before time. Al-Hakeem explains that Allah is the first and the last and that he created the throne, the pen, water, and the universe. He also emphasizes that Allah does not need the throne or angels to carry it as it is only a manifestation of his majesty and power. Al-Hakeem highlights that Muslims should not measure things of the unseen with their own logic and intellect but should have faith in Allah and his creations.

00:20:00
In this section, Assim al hakeem discusses the idea of believing in the unseen and describes how it is essential for Muslims to believe in certain things without knowing how or why they happen. He explains how we live in the dimensions of length, width, and depth and have a limited understanding of time, which is considered one of the four dimensions. He then goes on to say that after we die, we will be liberated from the three dimensions and be introduced to new ones. Al hakeem states that these dimensions will make our ability to see things sharper and clearer.

00:25:00
In this section, the speaker discusses the pillar of belief in destiny, which is the sixth pillar of Iman, and its importance in a Muslim's life. He emphasizes that a Muslim should believe in the concept of destiny and not question it, as it is written in the Quran and Sunnah. Everything that happens in a person's life is predetermined and written in the preserved tablet, including their destiny, spouse, children, and time of death. The belief in destiny helps a Muslim to have contentment and peace of mind in all situations, making them grateful for what they have rather than resentful towards what they lack. There are four pillars of belief in destiny, including writing, knowledge, intention, and execution. The divine will is also a crucial aspect of one's belief in destiny, as Allah wants everyone to believe and become a mu'min by fulfilling both types of divine will, legislative and universal.

In this section, the video explains the different pillars of the Islamic faith, from the belief in one god, to fulfilling the universal and religious will of Allah, to the concept of creation. It is emphasized that humans are not creators, but rather assemblers of materials that were already created by Allah. The purpose of creation is to worship Allah, which is not limited to prayer, fasting, and giving zakat. Rather, any action done with the intention of pleasing Allah, whether it be helping others or being kind in the community, can be considered a form of worship.

00:35:00
In this section, Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem emphasizes the importance of tawheed in Islam, which is knowing Allah azzawajal and believing in His oneness. He clarifies the misconceptions surrounding the term "Wahhabi" and discusses the three types of tawheed, which include the head of lordship, worship, and beautiful names and attributes. Additionally, he explains that the belief in tawheed is from the essence of the Islamic religion and should not be associated with ignorance or a particular group. Lastly, he gives an example of how even the idol worshipers believe in the tawheed of lordship.

00:40:00
In this section about the different types of tawheed (the oneness of Allah), the second type of tawheed is discussed, which is the realization that Allah is the only entity worthy of worship, and all types of worship must be devoted to him alone. The dispute between the messengers of Allah and the idol-worshippers took place here when the idol-worshippers refused to limit their worship to Allah alone. The third type of tawheed concerns belief in Allah's beautiful names and attributes, without distortion, misinterpretation, or denial of the reality, and without questioning how they are. Believing in these types of tawheed conditions one's mind not to go astray and prevents falling into shirk (associating partners with Allah). It is crucial to understand that Allah is unlike anything we know, and one should not have any thoughts of Allah needing his creation or any partner in his dominion.

00:45:00
In this section, Sheikh Al Hakeem explores the concept of shirk, which means associating partners with Allah. He emphasizes that even though Muslims may not believe in idols, they can still fall into shirk in their actions and hearts. He warns that shirk leads to worthless work and ultimate loss, as Allah threatened in the Quran. The Sheikh gives examples of how Muslims may express their dependence on other than Allah, such as turning to doctors before making dua when in trouble, and relying on their bosses for their paycheck rather than Allah. He concludes by summarizing that time is a creation that only exists in this period and reminds us that being in Jannah has no end, as it stems from Allah's grace.
