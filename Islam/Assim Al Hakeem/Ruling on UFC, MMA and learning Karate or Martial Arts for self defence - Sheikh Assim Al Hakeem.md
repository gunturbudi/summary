Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem addresses the permissibility of learning martial arts, such as MMA, for self-defense in Islam. He notes that as long as there is no haram element involved, such as free-mixing or hitting the face, it is permissible. However, he explains that striking the face is prohibited in Islam, even in self-defense. Therefore, if one learns martial arts for quick response and exercise, without the intention to harm, and with segregated training, it is acceptable.

In this section, Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem discusses the ruling on learning mixed martial arts (MMA) or other forms of martial arts for self-defense in Islam. The Sheikh explains that learning such skills is permissible as long as there is no haram element included in it, such as free-mixing or hitting the face. He explains that MMA is not permissible as this sport involves striking the face and is used to inflict harm as much as possible on one's opponent. According to the hadith, Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) prohibited striking the face during a fight even if it is in self-defense. However, if students learn martial arts with segregated training and avoid hitting the face and intending to harm their opponent and doing it for the sake of exercising and quick response, then there is nothing wrong with it.
