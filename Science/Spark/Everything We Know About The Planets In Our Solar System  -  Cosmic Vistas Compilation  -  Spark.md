The video describes how Cassini has been gathering data on Saturn and its rings, revealing new details that would have been missed if the spacecraft had not been given the extra time. The video also describes how the planet's seasons differ from Earth's, with a year on Saturn taking nearly 30 Earth years.

00:05:00
In 2009, Saturn's equinox, the sun shone directly onto the planet's equator, revealing peaks in its Rings that were previously invisible due to shadows cast by the moons. This video compilation shows various visual effects that occur as the seasons change on Saturn.

00:10:00
This video features a compilation of images from the Cassini spacecraft of Saturn and its largest moon, Titan. The images show the progress of a massive storm system on Saturn. The video also explains some of the findings from the images.

00:15:00
Cassini spacecraft discovered that Titan, one of the largest planets in our solar system, has lakes and rivers similar to Earth. These discoveries suggest that Titan's atmosphere and surface are dynamic and that the moon may have been able to support life in the past.

00:20:00
The video discusses the planets in our solar system, including Saturn, Titan, and Earth. It notes that while Earth is a world of the present, with constant change, Titan presents an alien landscape with lakes and rivers that behave like solid rock due to its atmosphere. Foreign scientists are now considering future missions to Titan that could include dropping a boat onto one of its lakes or perhaps the Kraken sea, the largest liquid feature on Titan.

00:25:00
The asteroid belt is a zone of flying rocks and miniature worlds that forms a vast ring of material orbiting around the Sun. The asteroid belt is a place of transition between the inner solar system or small rocky planets like Earth and the outer solar system where the planets are massive spheres of liquid gas. Scientists are seeking insights into a different transition- the one that billions of years ago LED from small bits of cosmic dust and debris to the planets that populate our solar system today. There are hundreds of thousands of objects in the asteroid belt most are only a few kilometers in size, but a handful of asteroids are hundreds of times larger than that and much more interesting. Don's mission is to explore the two most massive asteroids, Ceres and Vesta, both were discovered more than two centuries ago. Once free of Earth's gravity, Dawn spread its two enormous solar panels giving the spacecraft the appearance of a great bird in flight. The panels are part of an Innovative propulsion system that generates electricity from sunlight and uses it to drive a high-speed stream of ionized Xenon. The foreign belt is the place where such objects can still be found, but even here they are rare. Most of them were broken apart by collisions with other asteroids long ago, but the largest survivors of this

00:30:00
In this video, scientists discuss the first spacecraft to closely examine Vesta in an effort to tease out some billion-year-old secrets about the formation of the planets. Vesta is one of the largest asteroids of all and is tiny compared to Earth with the surface gravity that is only two percent what we experience on our world. Despite this, Dawn is able to keep in orbit around Vesta due to its small gravitational pull. After arriving in July of 2011, Dawn began imaging the asteroid's entire surface end to end. Among other discoveries, Dawn found a group of three craters that are dubbed the Snowman. Other features are more mysterious, such as the deep parallel troughs running roughly along the asteroid's equator. Scientists eventually realized that these troughs are related to the large-scale collisions that have rocked Vesta in the distant past. The fate of an asteroid is determined by its encounters with others in the early days of the solar system, and asteroids such as Vesta were built up from smaller bodies that collided and stuck together.

00:35:00
Scientists have analyzed the sunlight that reflects off of Vesta and have found that it is more similar to rocks found on Earth than any of the other planets in our solar system. Vesta is believed to have been a molten body billions of years ago, and today as Dawn patrols the planet's pockmarked surface, there are no obvious signs of past volcanic activity. However, scientists believe that Ria Sylvia, the largest and most impressive feature on Vesta, was created when a massive star exploded nearby.

00:40:00
This YouTube video explains how the two largest impacts on Vesta history created two large craters on the asteroid, each with its own unique features. The video also describes how Don Stewart's one-year study of Vesta has yielded new insights into the planet's history.

00:45:00
The video discusses the planets in our solar system and their properties. One of the most distinguishing features of Earth is that it has a vast ocean of water on its surface. Other planets in our solar system have mountains, deserts, and water in liquid form. Water shapes our world, moves energy around, and is essential for life. Scientists are searching for water on other planets in our solar system and beyond in order to determine whether or not they have the ingredients necessary for life. 

The video discusses Saturn's moon Enceladus, which has a bright surface and mysterious markings that scientists have nicknamed the tiger stripes. They speculate that the stripes are related to the presence of water on Enceladus. In July 2005, Cassini spotted dramatic fissures on Enceladus's surface that scientists believe were caused by water freezing and breaking apart the rock. If water is found on other planets in our solar system, it would support the theory that life may exist elsewhere in the universe.

00:50:00
The video showcases the discovery of jets of water vapor spewing from the south polar region of Enceladus, which has been revealed to be an incredibly unique occurrence. It is also speculated that Enceladus may be gaining additional heat from the gravitational pull of Saturn, which could mean that it has been active for a long time.

00:55:00
The video discusses evidence that there is water on Mars, including small gullies that were found on the surface of the planet. Scientists have been unable to explain some of the evidence, but suggest that water may be responsible. If water is present on Mars, this would have significant implications for the future of the planet.

01:00:00
The video discusses the various instruments used to search for life outside of our own solar system, including orbiting telescopes and space probes. One such planet, designated HD 209458b, has been found to have an atmosphere with evidence of water vapor. This discovery suggests that water may be present on other planets in similar solar systems.

01:05:00
According to this video, Kepler-22b is a planet that orbits a sun-like star and is similar in size to Kepler-22b but much closer to its star, making it easier to measure the planet's mass. Astronomers have determined that the planet is not nearly massive enough to be made entirely of rock, indicating that it is either a small rocky world with a vast atmosphere or a true Water World. If this is confirmed, the notion of a planet made almost entirely of water will no longer be science fiction.

01:10:00
In this video, cosmic vistas are compiled of the planets in our solar system. Earth is the largest and most massive planet in our system, and has a strong gravitational pull that holds almost anything to its surface, including the moon. Grace, a gravity recovery and climate experiment, measures subtle variations in Earth's gravitational field to study our planet's hidden structure and monitor its ongoing transformations. Other planets in our solar system are being explored using similar technology, and gravity is providing an exciting new way of seeing what was once hidden.

01:15:00
The video features a compilation of footage of the planets in our solar system, including footage of Isaac Newton and his work on gravity. The video also discusses the Grail Mission, which is designed to use gravity to explore the moon's gravity. The mission is ongoing, and so far, the Grail satellites have been able to make incredibly accurate measurements of the moon's gravity.

01:20:00
In this video, Grail explains how gravity is a force that can be used to explore other planets and galaxies. It takes one month for the moon to rotate on its axis, which allowed Grail to map the moon's entire gravitational field in exquisite detail. Scientists are now continuing to analyze the Treasure Trove of data that Grail has provided, hoping for a definitive glimpse of the moon's mysterious heart. This is the promise of gravity as a tool for space exploration, which offers a way for us not just to see other worlds, but to feel what's happening inside them.

01:25:00
gravitational wave astronomy is a relatively new field of study that uses lasers to detect minute changes in length across different distances in space. Lisa, the laser interferometer space antenna, will consist of three spacecraft precisely spaced in a triangle that is 5 million kilometers to a side. By using laser beams to track their relative positions, Lisa will be able to detect a change in their separation down to five trillionths of a centimeter. Such extraordinary precision lies at the very limits of current technology, but it should be just enough to allow scientists to listen in on a universe filled with gravitational waves.

01:30:00
The Space Shuttle program successfully completed 133 missions and nearly 150 astronauts have flown in it. It has helped to make space flight more routine, taught us about the dangers of Extreme Exploration, and blazed a trail for science in space.

01:35:00
The space shuttle was designed to fly in harsh conditions and be able to glide into a low-impact landing, and it was successful in doing so. The shuttle's imaging radar was able to see hidden information in the underlying rocks and soil, and it was also able to explore more remote volcanoes from orbit.

01:40:00
The Space Shuttle was used to study the possibility that the asteroid broke up into pieces before it struck, leaving not one crater but a chain of at least three craters. Foreign elsewhere, the same technology has also helped document more immediate changes here, such as a shuttle radar view of Chile's vast and remote Patagonia ice Fields taken in October of 1994. In this view, red and purple indicate areas of high elevation by comparing this image to one taken in the same shuttle mission researchers were able to measure the speed at which different parts of the glacier are moving. Such measurements are crucial for understanding how Earth's icy regions are responding to global climate change.

By the year 2000, the use of the Space Shuttle as a radar platform had evolved into the shuttle radar topography mission. Producing high resolution elevation data for 80 percent of Earth's surface, the mission was at that time the most detailed map of our world ever made. The Space Shuttle also explored our home planet in other ways, on three missions between 1992 and 1994. It carried the atlas experiment, designed to measure the chemistry of Earth's atmosphere and its interactions with the Sun. Among its many contributions were data that support the realization that chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs are

01:45:00
The space shuttle was crucial to building up our understanding of what happens to the body when it's in space, and it became the essential tool for creating the International Space Station. Starting in 1998, it began ferrying up many of the modules and other elements needed for the giant habitat. The space shuttle became less available to scientists as it became more difficult to pursue experiments in orbit, but the end result is something far greater and more versatile. In November of 2000, astronauts began arriving for the first long duration missions to the station, and the station has been occupied ever since, setting a new record for continuous human presence in space. The decision to accommodate six astronauts gives researchers an unprecedented platform for many to conduct experiments in life sciences, materials science, earth science and astronomy.

01:50:00
The ams2 will give scientists their best information yet about the high energy particle environment in our solar system, which is crucial for understanding how astronauts may one day avoid the hard radiation exposure that is one of the main hazards of a long interstellar voyage.

01:55:00
The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) is a spacecraft that has been orbiting Mars since 2006. It has revealed a great deal about the planet's surface, including the presence of fresh impacts, dark streaks on the plains, and dust devils. These findings help to tell the story of Martian history and the planet's dynamic nature.

02:00:00
The video discusses how the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has been able to help researchers understand the planet Mars more clearly. One particularly interesting discovery is a small crater that appears to have a dark center, which was only discovered when the orbiter zoomed in closer. This suggests that there may be a cave hidden below the surface.

02:05:00
The Mars Science Laboratory (mro) was sent to Mars in 2006 and has been helping surface missions find the best landing sites for the next Rover. The mission has also been exploring for evidence of water on the surface of Mars. Foreign was used to help narrow down the list of landing sites for the next Rover, and the final four were chosen based on criteria such as geology, potential for finding evidence of past water, and accessibility. One of the final sites chosen was a mysterious mountain that could unlock the secrets of ancient Mars.

02:10:00
Curiosity landed on Mars in 2012 and is currently exploring the planet. The Rover's nuclear power supply gives it the potential to explore Mars for years, allowing scientists to select a more ambitious target. One of the features on Mars that is a scientific curiosity is the mountain in Gale crater called Mount Sharp after a pioneering planetary scientist. By July of 2011, Curiosity's fate was sealed and it was announced that their new Rover would become a mountain climber. However, the Rover was different from all its predecessors in a crucial way- it was the first Mars mission to combine the mobility of a Rover and the scale and complexity of a field mission.

02:15:00
The video discusses how a new rover, called MRO, will help us understand Mars better. MRO will have the ability to operate for years on the surface, and it will be the longest journey ever attempted to another world. However, it will not be as lonely as Curiosity has been on Mars. MRO will be watched from above by the "Eagle Eye" rover, which has become a part of day-to-day life on Mars. The video also looks for signs of life in the past.
