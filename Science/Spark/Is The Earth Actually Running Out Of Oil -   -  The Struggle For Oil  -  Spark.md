The video discusses the idea that the earth may soon run out of oil, and the challenges that will arise as a result. It states that many scientists believe that we have already passed the peak of world oil production, while oil producers remain silent about the remaining reserves. The video also discusses the importance of horizontal drilling techniques over vertical drilling techniques, and the potential for Saudi Arabia to become a major global oil supplier in the future.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
In 2010, a drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico blew up, releasing an estimated 780 million liters of crude oil into the Gulf. This ecological disaster has led to a growing debate about whether or not the Earth is running out of oil. Many scientists believe that we have already passed the peak of world oil production, while oil producers remain silent about the remaining reserves. Houston Texan Matt Simmons worked as an oil technology investor until 2010 and says that there is zero transparency about what's really happening in the top 100 to 200 oil fields in the world. If and how many new oil fields will be discovered will determine our world's future.

The video discusses how oil is extracted from the earth, how it became profitable in the past due to high global energy prices, and how drilling at such depths is difficult and can cost millions of euros per hole. The geologist discusses how there is still no guarantee of success at extracting oil from deeper layers of the earth, and if Asia were to catch up to the U.S. consumption rates, the global production would have to increase by 300% per day. Finally, the video discusses how modern agriculture would not be able to feed the world population without oil, and how industrial fishing fleets would cease working if the price of diesel rises too high.

This video discusses the challenges of finding and extracting oil, and the potential for new oil reserves to be discovered. It also discusses the importance of horizontal drilling techniques over vertical drilling techniques, and the potential for Saudi Arabia to become a major global oil supplier in the future.

According to the video, the increasing water to oil ratio is a sure indication for a depleting field, and only through incredible investments can new oil fields be developed. Consequently, more research dollars are spent on increasing the recovery factor of an aging field. In Oman, the injection of polymers started on a large scale in 2010, and if successful it means a quantum leap for the global oil production. If we take a look at this particular oil and surfactant mixture, we assume to be able to increase the recovery factor by 10 to 20 percent. If the recovery can be increased by only one percent globally, it could secure enough extra supply for another three years. However, the technology to scan the deep basins for oil is based on compressed air so-called air guns, and the sound produced by these guns is so loud that it can be heard within milliseconds. This technology has the potential to find oil and gas deposits that reflect a known echo pattern.

The video discusses the challenges of extracting oil and gas from the Earth's surface, and how technology has changed in order to make the process more difficult and expensive. It also touches on the potential for oil and gas reserves in the polar region, and the dangers of a spill. Finally, the video discusses the development of a deep sea drilling platform, and how it was a long and complex process.

The video discusses the challenges of drilling in deep water, and how an unexpected event, such as a hurricane, can lead to a large oil spill. Eleven workers died in the 2010 Deepwater Horizon blowout, and the incident led to the largest oil spill in American history.

00:30:00
The video discusses the risks of oil spills and how BP's attempts to stop the flow of oil have resulted in a large amount of the crude oil spreading out and becoming more toxic. Corexit, a chemical dispersant, is discussed in depth and it is shown that it can cause serious health problems when dispersed in water. BP's decision to use the chemical in the Gulf of Mexico has resulted in an increase in engine damages and a increase in the amount of oil floating on the surface of the ocean.

The video discusses the possibility that the earth may run out of oil. It states that, due to the drilling operation, some fractures occurred along the well which may allow oil and gas to continue to seep up into the water. Life seems back to normal in the gulf of Mexico, but the U.S. government doesn't want to injure its national oil production. However, at what price half the gulf of Mexico is almost depleted and the other half is resting on a handful of supergiant fields that will not be super giants five years from now? Only two fields reached their design capacity and the average field only got to 50 percent of the design capacity for about a month or two, so they were all effectively commercial failures. In a sense, because had they basically known that they could only produce that little, they would have spent one-third the amount of money and come up with smaller things. The best minds in the industry are excited about these things, but they don't tend to go back and look at their own data. However, Matt Simmons, who owes much of his success to high-end oil technology investments, is concerned. He worries that if you were five thousand feet under water, you would have a problem putting it out. The answer

The video discusses the current situation with regard to oil, and how it is currently difficult to find new reserves. It also discusses the possibility that oil may be coming from places we don't previously think of, such as the depths of the earth. If this is true, it could mean that we may not be running out of oil quite yet.

The video discusses oil production and the possible sources of new oil. It states that the concept that the earth is producing continuously oil is not new, and that it was first theorized by Dimitri Medelliv 100 years ago. However, western oil researchers remain skeptical of the non-biological origin of oil. Russian oil experts have a conference on the regenerating oil reservoirs in the ramoskino field. This is interesting because it shows that even western experts are open to the possibility that oil can be produced in a non-organic manner. However, various exceptions still exist, such as in Vietnam where oil and gas are found in granite rock.

The video discusses evidence that suggests that oil does not come from a biological source, and that hydrocarbons can be created through natural processes without the need for life. The researchers discuss the potential for new oil fields to be discovered in close proximity to active and deep faults, which indicates that the abiotic theory may be correct. Despite this, the oil industry continues to battle over the idea of a "scarcity" of oil, with no clear resolution in sight.
