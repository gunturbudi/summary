The planets in our solar system are different in many ways from Earth, including being much colder and drier, having weaker gravity, and having less atmosphere. Scientists have been trying to figure out if Mars has ever been habitable, and while there is still much we don't know about the planet, recent missions have revealed more about its surface and atmosphere.

The Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, were sent to Mars in 2004. Spirit became stuck in a sandstorm, but was able to be freed and continue its mission. Opportunity landed on the opposite side of the planet and found evidence of water on Mars. In 2004, NASA announced that it would extend the Rovers' missions. The Rovers were able to grind away a rock's surface for a more detailed analysis of geological samples, which was a first on Mars. There are now plans to send a second rover to the planet to continue its investigations.

The video presents a compilation of incredible facts about the planets in our solar system. Among the highlights are that hot water provides an environment in which microbes can thrive, Spirit limped on for another three years before it became stuck in loose sand again, the engineers began working with a replica which they placed in an identical situation where nothing was able to free the Rover, it was declared a stationary research platform, further attempts were made to position the Rover so its solar panels could operate more effectively but even this was not possible, the last communication from Spirit was in March 2010, Opportunity lasted until June 2018 when dust clogged its solar panels, in March 2006 NASA's Mars reconnaissance Orbiter arrived at Mars and began the now routine business of Aero breaking though this procedure took roughly six months the saving and fuel will see the craft functioning at Mars into the 2030s, one of the primary functions of the new Orbiter is as a Communications relay station, it's three meter antenna transmitting in the ultra high frequency band enables very high data rates, by November 2013 it had tripled the amount of data sent to Earth by all the other NASA missions combined, the poles of Mars were now attracting keen interest follow the water had become NASA's catch cry, the Phoenix Lander was targeted at the northern

The video presents information about the planets in our solar system, including Mars. The current mission to Mars, Curiosity, is investigating if conditions suitable for life ever existed or still exist on the surface of Mars. Curiosity has also gathered detailed information about the current conditions on the planet, including radiation levels that will have an impact on proposed manned missions.

The planets in our solar system are fascinating for a variety of reasons, including the fact that Mars had a warm, wet past, but it is now cold and dry. The inner probe on Mars also hammered a thermal sensor into the surface to measure heat flow from the planet's core. By understanding processes within Mars, we can learn how the geological histories of Mars and Earth began to diverge. Saturn is more than 100 times the mass of Earth and is orbited by at least 62 moons. Our only detailed examination of the Saturnian system ended in 2017 when the Cassini probe was intentionally crashed into the planet's dense atmosphere.

00:30:00
The Voyager probes were sent to explore the outer planets, Saturn in particular. The first probe, Voyager 1, encountered the ring system around Saturn and captured images of the moons Titan and Enceladus. However, the thick atmosphere of methane and nitrogen on Titan was impenetrable, and Voyager 1 was unable to go into orbit around Saturn. Voyager 2, which had a different trajectory, reached Saturn in 1995 and captured detailed pictures of the Rings. The Rings are named for letters of the alphabet, in the order they were discovered, and it became apparent that they had changed since Voyager 1 observed them. The probe also returned pictures of the moon Enceladus, which has a cracked uncrated surface made of ice below which is an ocean. Voyager 2 was unable to go into orbit around Saturn and sped on toward Uranus. Cassini, a collaboration between NASA, the European space agency, and the Italian space agency, was launched in 1997 and reached Saturn in 2004. Its 12 different instruments each had a dedicated team of research specialists on Earth to interpret the data it sent back. Cassini's High Gain antenna was used for high-speed data relay back to Earth, but it was also used as a shield to protect the spacecraft from debris impact when crossing

00:35:00
The Cassini-Huygens mission was successful in studying the Saturnian system, including the moon Enceladus. The mission also uncovered that Titan, which is much colder than Earth, has weather and surface features similar to Earth, but is composed of different chemical elements.

00:40:00
Enceladus is a small, icy planet that is notable for its global ocean, hydrothermal vents, and the presence of organic material. The Cassini spacecraft has detected a range of signs that suggest life could exist on Enceladus, including hot water under the ice and organic material coming out of the hydrothermal vents. However, the stability of these conditions over time is still unknown.

00:45:00
The Cassini spacecraft was able to collect a wealth of data about the planets and moons in our solar system during its lengthy mission. One of the most amazing facts about Cassini is that it was able to collect data about the rings even as it was being pulled towards Saturn by the planet's gravity. By the time the mission was ended, Cassini had collected information about more than 60 moons.

00:50:00
The Cassini spacecraft's mission ended on September 15, 2017, after studying Saturn and its many moons for more than two dozen years. Cassini's data was sent back to Earth for analysis, and it is now being processed. One of the major findings from Cassini's mission was that Jupiter is much more complex than previously thought. The ancient Romans knew Jupiter as the celestial representation of the king of the Gods. Pioneer 10 and 11 were two of the spacecrafts that were used to make the trip to Jupiter, and they left Earth in 1973 and 1974, respectively.

00:55:00
The Voyager spacecraft were the first probes to be launched into deep space, and their mission was to explore the planets in our solar system. Voyager 1 visited Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, while Voyager 2 visited Europa and Saturn's moon, Titan. The data collected by the Voyager spacecraft has revolutionized our understanding of the planets and their moons, and has also shown us that our solar system is quite old.

01:00:00
This video covers the history of the Galileo probe, which was sent to Jupiter in 1989 in order to study its atmosphere. Along the way, it discovered that the planet has very little water vapor in it, and that its interior is very hot.

01:05:00
The Juno spacecraft was successfully sent to Jupiter by the Atlas V rocket in 2016. Its mission was to study the planet's atmosphere and its magnetic field.

01:10:00
Juno is a spacecraft that has been orbiting Jupiter since 2016. The mission is to study the planet's composition and atmosphere.

The planets in our solar system are fascinating and varied in their properties. Jupiter has a profound influence on the rest of the planets, and has more mass than any other planet combined. Venus presents different problems because it's our closest planetary neighbor and easier to reach, but its surface has hellish conditions. The Mariner 2 probe successfully reached Venus in 1962, but was destroyed a few minutes after launch because of a coding error.

01:20:00
The Moon had failed Mariner 2 on its way to Venus, and it was functioning but its transmissions were weak. After a week, instructions for a complex course correction were transmitted to the spacecraft, and about an hour later, Mariner executed the maneuver which involved a roll turn, followed by a pitch turn and finally a main engine burn. Foreign objects in the spacecraft's path caused some problems, but eventually Mariner regained lock on the Sun and the Earth, and its attitude reference points. Next, the signal strength increased to its normal level, but a short in a solar panel left it low on power. This time, although both America and the Soviet Union had been sending probes toward the planets, nothing had succeeded. Finally, Mariner 2 lost several Telemetry sensors and it began to overheat. It continued limping toward Venus but some of the spacecraft's problems were solving themselves. Mariner 2 was now close enough to the Sun that it could function effectively on just one solar panel. Past slightly less than 35,000 kilometers above Venus's Cloud tops, it could detect no planetary magnetic field and it recorded temperatures across the planet approaching 500 degrees Kelvin. Clearly landing on the surface would present problems, but first real success in space finally doing something that the Soviets had

01:25:00
The Venera probes were instrumental in revealing the surface of Venus, which has undergone extensive change over time.

01:30:00
This video discusses the history and technical challenges of two missions to Mercury, Mariner 10 and Messenger. Mariner 10 was the first mission to successfully fly by Mercury, and Messenger was the first mission to orbit the planet. Both missions used Venus's gravity to reduce their speed and approach the planet at an acute angle. However, Messenger was not able to map all of Mercury's surface due to the lack of sunlight at the poles. Messenger also discovered substantial amounts of water ice at the poles.

In this video, several interesting facts about the planets in our solar system are recounted. Voyager 2, which has been exploring the solar system beyond the planets, ceased transmitting data in 2006 due to power constraints, but has since been revived and continues to explore the outer reaches of the solar system. Additionally, Pluto was reclassified as a planet after more objects of similar size were discovered in the Kuiper Belt. Finally, the Earth is unique in that it is the only planet in the universe to have given rise to life.

The video discusses the origins of the planets in our solar system, including the processes that led to the emergence of Jupiter and Saturn. It also discusses the stabilizing effects of the moon upon the Earth's rotation, and how the Earth's axis would vary without the moon's influence.

01:50:00
The Earth's distance from the Sun was just right for the abundance of water on the planet to exist in liquid form, as the moon had drifted away. The rapid rotation of the planet had slowed, and the sun's heat was evenly shared across the surface. The Earth's large metallic core combined with the planet's rotation meant that a magnetic field stretched out around the planet, deflecting the charged solar wind. In a hostile Universe, Earth was a uniquely benign environment. The geological record shows that around 2.7 billion years ago oxygen began occurring in the atmosphere. The vast iron ore regions of Western Australia were formed as iron in the oceans reacted with the new abundance of oxygen to form iron oxide. Simple plant life was using the sunlight and carbon dioxide to live, producing highly reactive oxygen as a waste product. This enabled more complex life to emerge, building an intricate web of interconnected plants and animals. This change in the atmosphere had other dramatic consequences, including the beginning of ice ages. Though there is an abundance of evidence showing planetary glaciation punctuated by warm periods, the factors triggering these Cycles are complex and largely unknown. The effect of volcanic activity on the atmosphere and changes in the direction of the Earth's axis with regard to our planet's elliptical orbit

The video discusses the history of Earth observation, with particular focus on the development of weather satellites. It goes on to say that, although there is still variability in the climate cycle, humans are increasingly affecting it in a negative way.

Since 1913, spectroscopy has shown that a layer of ozone in the stratosphere blocks harmful UV sunlight from reaching the ground, in 1974, Mario Molina, a postdoctoral fellow working on hot atom chemistry, published a paper suggesting that the family of industrial chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) could damage the ozone layer, in the 1980s, meteorologists working in Antarctica found the evidence that the polar vortex above the southern continent concentrates the CFCs in the stratosphere, mother of pearl clouds in the polar skies contain ice crystals which in combination with ultraviolet split chlorine from the CFC molecule, each chlorine atom can break down over one hundred thousand ozone molecules, a large area centered over Antarctica showed almost no ozone, became known as the hole in the ozone layer, the UN began talks aimed at limiting the production of CFCs and in 1989, an international treaty known as the Montreal protocol capped the production of CFCs and ultimately resulted in a 10-year phase out of CFC production, all countries signed the agreement and the Montreal protocol is seen as a model of international cooperation, in the 1980s, an upward Trend in global temperature averages was becoming clear and a scientific consensus emerged that the burning of fossil fuels
