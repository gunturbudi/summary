The Euro Tunnel is the world's longest underwater tunnel, connecting France and England. The tunnel is a source of controversy because of its cost and the recent fire that occurred in it. However, the tunnel is still operational and is considered a marvel of engineering.

The European Union is planning to build the longest underwater tunnel in the world, and some workers will not survive the journey. However, the creation of the tunnel is a story of triumph, one of this century's great superstructures.

The video discusses the construction of the world's longest underwater tunnel, which was funded solely by private investment. There was much public opposition to the project, with some opponents concerned about the environmental impact of the tunnel and others not wanting to surrender England's status as a proud island empire. The project's decision-making body, a consortium of ten companies called Trans-Maunch Limited or TML, is undaunted and plans to design three parallel tube-like tunnels when finished. Engineers envision a system that will carry thousands of passengers and hundreds of tons of freight each day on this circular 30-minute trip between the French terminal at Calais and the British terminal at Folkstone. No other project has ever attempted to tunnel this far in such a hostile environment, and there are many technical and logistical problems that must be addressed before issues regarding the tunnel's operation can be addressed. At the Robbins Company, a firm specializing in heavy mining and tunneling equipment, the next breed of super machines is being created: a mechanical beast called a tunnel boring machine or TBM. When finished, the giant snake-like earth mover will be over 800 feet long and weigh over 1500 tons. Its rotating head almost 50 feet in diameter consists of hundreds of cutting edges made from tungsten

The article describes the construction of the longest underwater tunnel in the world, which will link England and France. The tunnel will be constructed using a machine called a tunnel boring machine (TBM), which is part boring machine and part submarine. The TBMs will be lowered into the tunnel one piece at a time, and will have to be assembled on site. The race to complete the tunnel on time and on budget is already a daunting task, and is only made more difficult by the cultural barriers that must be overcome between the French and British workers.

The video discusses how the construction of the longest underwater tunnel in the world is a difficult and challenging process, with various problems and setbacks along the way. Eventually, the tunnel is completed and is operational.

This video tells the story of construction of the longest underwater tunnel in the world, which started off smoothly but soon ran into difficulties. The tunnel is made up of two machines, one from Britain and one from France, which are meant to meet up and be joined together. However, due to various problems, including a death, the tunnel has been delayed multiple times. If the tunnel is not completed on schedule, it could mean the end of the project.

The workers constructing the world's longest underwater tunnel are facing many dangers, including the risk of being submerged in water up to three feet deep. However, despite the hazards, the tunnel remains unchanged. It's always dark down in the tunnels, and while the workers are down there, they must keep a careful eye out for other workers and machines, as well as for the constantly-dark environment. The tunnel is also home to some of the world's most powerful locomotives, each of which must be able to pull a 2400-ton train by itself. The new service, exclusive to the Euro Tunnel, is called Le Shuttle.

The video discusses the history and construction of the world's longest underwater tunnel, which was completed in 1990. The tunnel links England and France, and was a major accomplishment for both countries.

The world's longest underwater tunnel is nearing completion, and in order to ensure that it is as safe as possible, engineers have created a system of fireproof walls and cooling stations. In the event of an emergency, the train drivers will also be able to use onboard computers to control the train's speed.

The video discusses the construction of the world's longest underwater tunnel, which was completed in 1994. The first section of the tunnel was completed in 1991 and the final section was completed in 1994. The tunnel links France and Britain and has been a source of controversy because of its cost (now almost 21 billion dollars).

The Euro Tunnel, a tunnel between England and France, was closed after a fire caused by a train carrying cargo. The accident caused damage estimated at almost 100 million dollars, making it one of the costliest rail accidents in history. The tunnel's safety is still a debated topic, with some critics accusing the officials of staging an emergency evacuation drill to reassure the public instead of actually safety. Despite the accident, freight traffic resumes on June 15th, almost seven months after the accident.

The Euro Tunnel, which stretches beneath the ocean between France and Spain, is a marvel of engineering. The video describes the tunnel's construction, which involved thousands of workers and incredible technology. The tunnel has helped to unify Europe and has symbolized the continent's growing unity.
