The documentary reveals how Cadbury is using technology to reduce sugar in popular products like Cadbury Dairy Milk without comprising its taste and texture. With the factory's highly skilled workforce and advanced technologies, Cadbury can produce up to 500 tons of chocolate a day, but also has to carefully manage waste.

In this section, cameras are given rare access inside the secretive Cadbury Chocolate Factory, where real-life "umpa lumpers" work to create Britain's insatiable appetite for chocolate. The company is facing its biggest challenge in a century, to dramatically cut sugar from its popular Cadbury Dairy Milk. To solve this problem, Cadbury is using everything at its disposal, from computers that can taste to the most finely tuned human taste buds. Despite being bought by an American food giant nearly a decade ago, Cadbury's dedication to making delicious moments of joy has not changed, and they continue to be a favorite among British chocoholics.

In this section, we learn that the Cadbury factory can produce as many as 400 bars of chocolate per minute and up to 500 tons of chocolate a day, which gets stored in a massive seven-story high warehouse. With the demand rising for reduced sugar products, Cadbury faces a challenge to produce chocolate bars that contain less than the existing 50% sugar content. Chocolate scientist Adam Harris has spent the past two years developing a new recipe with less sugar and more fiber that mimics the taste and texture of the original dairy milk. Harris is now testing the new recipe and is excited to see its success in the marketplace.

In this section, we see a behind-the-scenes view of the Cadbury chocolate factory, including the massive production of Cadbury's famous creme eggs. However, health experts warn that these small chocolate eggs pack a massive sugar punch, equal to a whole day's recommended intake for a child. Meanwhile, in Cadbury's pilot plant, chocolate scientist Adam Harris struggles to reinvent Cadbury Dairy Milk with 30% less sugar, a massive challenge given how the brand's fans are "religious" about the original recipe. Other researchers analyze chocolate and breath into a machine to study flavor perception, while the Department of Mouth Feel studies the ideal chewing time for a chocolate bar.

In this section, the video explores how Cadbury markets their products, specifically the Creme Egg. A nationwide Easter egg hunt has been created for the white chocolate Creme Egg, some even containing golden tickets worth up to Â£10,000. 5,000 of these eggs are being hand-crafted by Parmeseet and Maggie, which is a difficult process as the filling is made mostly of sugar. Even though Parmeseet has worked with chocolate before, she hasn't actually hand-made them, which makes the process more challenging. The video shows their progress and how they deal with the casualties and casualties along the way.

In this section, it is shown how even with new technology and expensive machines, accidents can still happen in the chocolate factory that can cause a significant amount of waste. Despite the changes and investments in automation, the number of people working in the factory has reduced. The documentary also takes a quick stroll down memory lane, with former employees reminiscing about the "family" culture and how the Cadbury's factory has changed since it was owned by an American food giant. The reduced sugar team has also produced a new liquid version of dairy milk, which they are trying to get to form into solid bars, experimenting and adjusting the temperatures until they get the right consistency.

In this section, the video explores Cadbury's new ad campaign promoting a competition for the public to come up with flavor combinations for a new chocolate bar. One of the finalists is Melanie Fuller, a primary school teacher from Manchester, who talks about how she and her sick mother came up with the flavor combination of raspberry and chocolate. Fuller shares that getting the packaging right, including little hidden details, will be crucial to the success of the raspberry bar. While Fuller is awaiting the public vote on the new flavor combination, the video also shows Adam, a chocolatier, molding his own bar and undergoing a taste test. Additionally, the video features Cadbury's design agency hard at work creating a wrapper for the sugar light bar, with the challenge being that it has to have all the indulgence with none of the compromise.

In this section, we see how Acer, the creator of Cadbury wrappers, seeks inspiration by touring the Cadbury archive and understanding the brand's DNA. Sarah Foden, the keeper of the archive, shows some of the earliest Dairy Milk packaging and emphasizes the flowing shape as an essential element of the brand's history. Acer and his team try to make the bar irresistible to health-conscious chocoholics with the reduced sugar version, but ensure that it feels indulgent enough. Additionally, we see an undercover operative hiding 5,000 winning white Creme Eggs, and the reverse shoplifting practice of Jeremy Stern. Lastly, the competition to invent a new Cadbury chocolate bar reaches its climax with Melanie's campaign to win the public vote.

In this section, we see a glimpse of the life of Louise Attenborough, one of the winners of the Cadbury's contest, which allowed her to design her own Dairy Milk Bar. Her beloved late mother collected butterfly figurines, and Louise received a call from a Cadbury representative who said they added a hidden butterfly to the wrapper design of her customized bar. Meanwhile, Adam, a food inventor, is presenting his 30% Less Sugar Chocolate prototype to a panel of tasters who will determine if it can match the original Cadbury Dairy Milk bar. The panel noted a difference in texture and flavor but provided generally favorable feedback on Adam's creation.

In this section, we see that the white cream egg campaign of Cadbury has been a massive success with sales skyrocketing. The new 30% less sugar wrapper has won the approval of the marketing team, stating that a treat should look good and tasty. Following extensive testing, the new reduced sugar bar is finally ready for launch, offering customers a choice to have less sugar in their diet. Adam and his team are happy and emotional about the new release, with the new bar expected to be available in supermarkets up and down the country. Chocolate superfans have mixed reviews, with some appreciating the change, while others believe that the original is better.

In this section of the video, the speaker discusses the reduction of sugar in Cadbury chocolate and questions whether this means it is a healthier option. However, while the sugar content may have decreased slightly, the calorie count remains the same, leading to confusion about the health benefits of the chocolate. The video also shows a cool visual of the chocolate making process at the factory.
