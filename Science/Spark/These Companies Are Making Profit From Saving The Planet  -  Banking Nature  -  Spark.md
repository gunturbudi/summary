The video discusses the concept of financialization in relation to nature, where assigning value to nature and investing in its protection can lead to high financial returns. The idea of putting a price on the destruction of natural resources has led to the emergence of environmental markets, allowing companies to profit while still protecting the environment. However, there is concern over letting profit-driven institutions decide which species are worth saving, and the involvement of some companies with poor environmental records in partnerships for nature conservation efforts. Some environmentalists express concern over the "green economy" label, which they see as a guise for the privatization of nature. Despite this, partners in these alliances see it as the only way to save the planet.
This video explores the idea of companies and financial institutions profiting from nature preservation and biodiversity markets. However, it also highlights the potential issues with these markets, such as the harmful impact on indigenous populations and the potential for these markets to crash. The video argues that valuing nature solely in economic terms is dangerous and suggests finding other ways to prioritize preserving the planet. While some companies are making positive impacts, there are concerns about leaving nature in the hands of these entities given their history of causing crises and environmental damage.

Detail Summary:

In this section, the video explores the idea that financialization could help save the planet by assigning value to nature and investing in its protection. The economic invisibility of nature means that much of what it provides, such as clean air and water, is not transacted in markets. However, economists and finance professionals argue that if we assign value to nature and invest in its protection, there can be high financial returns. Despite this, some are concerned that treating endangered species and forests like financial products could lead to risks and price distortions.

In this section, the video explores how the current economic system has been designed to value capital and labor, rather than natural resources or ecosystems. However, with the increasing importance of the environment, a new economic sector has risen that promises huge returns for investors. Banks, finance corporations, and even states are investing in this sector, as they understand that on a dead planet, they won't be able to do business. The supply and demand theory is applicable to natural resources, and as the demand continues to grow while natural resources dwindle, the pricing system in place for these resources will have to change. This new thought process is a recent concept as up until recently, no one had thought about putting the pricing system into life itself.

00:10:00
In this section, the video discusses how modern lifestyles have led to an increase in our ecological footprint, causing the earth's resources to be overused, leading to a scarcity of clean air, water, and other resources. The video highlights how this scarcity opens an opportunity for companies to profit by putting a price on the destruction of natural resources. The video cites an example of a mitigation bank that purchased the habitat of the Delhi sand flower loving fly and did nothing with it, allowing the rare insect to live in peace. The bank then sold shares, which entrepreneurs bought to offset their impact on the insects' habitat, allowing the bank to make profits of 20 million dollars. The video argues that the free market can achieve a balance between conservation and development while allowing companies to make a profit by investing in the protection of natural resources.

00:15:00
In this section, it is discussed how species protection is now being handled by "mitigation banks" in the US. Businesses, estate agents, and road builders, among others, must pay these banks if their activity endangers any animals, and the banks protect over a million acres of land and sell credits for various species. The biggest of these banks is Wildlands, which generates over $40 million annually from mitigating for various endangered species. The decision of which species to protect is dependent on market demand, causing concern over letting profit-based institutions decide which animals are worth saving. While some argue this is a new and innovative way to save the planet and be profitable, others question the ethics of profit-driven species protection.

00:20:00
In this section, we learn about the concept of natural capital, which refers to capital created by nature such as the climate system, trees, and biodiversity. Ecosystem services are the benefits that nature provides for humans, making it a real business that can offer its services to consumers. Pavan Sukhdev, the global guru on economy and biodiversity, asserts that the economic value of nature must be calculated and accounted for in order to fully understand the losses that occur when it disappears. While some disagree with putting a price on nature, Sukhdev argues that it is short-sighted, and many people participated in demonstrations to demand stronger policies to solve the environmental crisis.

00:25:00
In this section, the ecosystem marketplace, a non-profit company based in Washington D.C., is introduced as a leading business in promoting and implementing markets for ecosystem services, such as biodiversity and carbon. The company created a matrix to show the potential growth of such markets, including 10% each year for biodiversity markets and 55% for carbon markets. The concept of natural capital, whereby ecosystems and natural resources are recognized as valuable assets, is discussed, and the belief that markets can help solve the environmental crisis is gaining ground. However, this idea has been shaped over 50 years and has faced opposition from those who believe regulations stifle economic growth.

00:30:00
In this section of the video, it is shown how environmental regulations were cut back or made more flexible, which opened up the creation of market instruments to save nature. For example, businesses could now destroy parts of the wetlands as long as they offset the damage they caused. This led to the creation of environmental markets where companies could profit while still protecting the environment. In Borneo, an investment fund set up the world's largest mitigation bank, which is seeking to monetize the ecological value of the forest and make a profit by offering credits to customers like pension funds and insurance companies. This commercial approach to conservation seeks to protect Borneo's unique 150 million-year-old forest and its species from extinction caused by logging and palm oil plantations.

00:35:00
In this section, we learn about the concept of natural capital and how companies can profit from it through the sale of "jungle credits" or certificates that allow them to destroy primary forests. Melua Bank is one such company that sells these credits to palm oil producers and other food processing companies. Environmental markets, although initially seen as niches, are becoming more promising as investors recognize the potential in long-term value generation. However, it is concerning that many of the same banks that were involved in trading that led to the last financial crisis are also actively involved in the trading of natural capital.

00:40:00
In this section, the video focuses on individuals who made successful careers in finance and banking, but then went on to lead successful conservation efforts. The CEO of The Nature Conservancy, a former environmental banker at Goldman Sachs, recognizes the value of nature, and he uses his skills and expertise in finance to provide innovative financing mechanisms for environmental conservation efforts. Similarly, the Ecologist Banker, a former employee at Deutsche Bank, argues that putting a price on nature doesn't mean turning it into a commodity, but rather aims to make states more aware of their ecological riches and make companies more responsible. These individuals have recognized that the direction in which they use their economic weaponry is an ethical choice, and they have chosen to shoot in the right direction by championing environmental causes.

00:45:00
In this section, it is highlighted that the world's largest gathering for environment conservation, the Earth Summit in Rio, did not include many corporations 20 years ago. Currently, multinational corporations have fashioned an effective lobby group by influencing UN's Earth Summit, with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development having a goal to do so in 1992. The council comprises around 200 corporations, many of which have a poor environmental record, and was created to influence the Rio Summit. Companies like Shell, BP, and Rio Tinto have successfully partnered with the UN, making commitments towards deforestation and understanding ecosystems even though their lobbying activities contradict those claims.

00:50:00
In this section, the video highlights the idea of a "green economy" and the involvement of businesses and corporations in environmental protection. Some environmentalists express concern about the "green economy" label, seeing it as a guise for the privatization of nature. However, some companies and organizations have formed partnerships to work towards environmental goals. The video questions the ethics of this alliance, but also considers the possibility that it may be the only way to save the planet. The Nature Conservancy is mentioned as an example of an NGO that partners with multinationals to fund nature conservation efforts.

00:55:00
In this section, the video highlights the promise of additional profits for businesses that commit to preserving the environment, along with their desire to improve their image. Vale, a mining giant with a turnover of over $46 billion operating in 38 countries, committed itself to the green economy and started reforesting certain areas of the Amazon. Despite its ecological impact, the company has already planted over 100,000 acres of trees and has a further 400,000 in the pipeline. However, Vale has also faced criticism for corporate irresponsibility, triggering the creation of an international victims' organization. The video suggests that systemic improvements are needed, rather than just recognition of what is wrong with environmental practices.

01:00:00
In this section, we learn how some companies are profiting from "green" investments and biodiversity markets, despite not actually protecting the planet's biodiversity. One example is a multinational that operates the Amazon's most important iron mine and claims to offset its impact by running streams, but is actually only growing a single species of tree - eucalyptus - in the Amazonian forest it claims to be replanting. Markets cannot protect biodiversity, and this is highlighted by the failure of the Kyoto Protocol and the growing threat of climate change caused by carbon emissions.

01:05:00
In this section, the video discusses the concept of creating a global trading platform for carbon that acts as a global commodity market where carbon credits are distributed to industrialized nations to reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. Companies can invest in clean energy or purchase carbon credits from other companies who have not utilized their own carbon quotas. Western companies, from small to multinational corporations, invest in developing nations to protect nature or plant forests to generate ecosystem services and natural capital that can be used to offset carbon emissions. The carbon hunting methodology used by carbon hunters is detailed and explained, but concerns arise around the efficacy of carbon trading as numbers and results don't seem to be adding up.

01:10:00
In this section, the video discusses the controversial use of environmental markets, where companies can make profit by selling carbon credits that promise to protect forests and reduce carbon emissions. However, many of these markets are causing harm to indigenous people in developing countries who are being forced out of their homes to make way for new forest plantations. Additionally, the speculative nature of these markets leaves them vulnerable to potential crashes, which could have disastrous consequences for conservation efforts. Despite this, many investors are still contributing to these markets in the hopes of making a profit in the future.

01:15:00
In this section, the video discusses the dangers of financialization and pricing when it comes to preserving nature. The World Bank and several major banks are offering green bonds, which they say will redirect finance to serve the environment. However, some experts fear that a market-based approach may not be the best way to protect the planet, as the banks may develop the hardware and software of this new market to benefit themselves more than nature. They draw parallels to the financial crisis of 2008-2009, where financial derivatives were traded rapidly and not used to help house owners safely finance their homes, but rather increase bank profits, leading to devastating consequences for both the economy and ecosystems. The video argues that pricing and financialization are diseases that may lead to the degradation and destruction of nature.

01:20:00
In this section, the video discusses the issue of trading biodiversity and nature preservation on financial markets. While securitizations can be good in some instances, there is a fear that some investment funds and banks view species as something that can be bought and sold, leading to the potential for disaster. Many banks commit to protecting species for only 50 years, which is just enough time to make a profit. However, the video suggests that valuing nature only in economic terms is a dangerous mentality to have. Instead, we need to find other ways to value nature and prioritize preserving it, recognizing that it has value beyond just monetary worth.

01:25:00
In this section, the video discusses the idea of financial institutions and corporations profiting from saving the planet. The question is raised on whether it is a good idea to leave nature in the hands of these entities, as they have a history of causing crises and damaging the environment. However, the video also highlights companies that are making a positive impact on the environment, such as those that provide solar panels to suburban homes. The potential for companies to market themselves as environmentally conscious and make a profit while also saving the planet is discussed.
