Dr. John Wass' documentary explores the role of hormones in human biology. Among his findings is that testosterone plays a major role in turning boys into men. His experiments demonstrating this were largely ignored by his contemporaries, who instead made bizarre claims about the testicles. In 1922, Brown published a book claiming that he had found a way to rejuvenate old men off of just two testicles. This ridiculous claim led to significant consequences, including the mass delusion that testicles could keep people young.

This video discusses the history of hormones, including the development of Organo therapy, which involved the injection of various glands into people with very little scientific evidence to cure various illnesses. However, the real credit for these breakthroughs goes to two British doctors, Victor Horsley and Bronzor Card, who pioneered the use of hormones to cure endocrinology ailments such as mix edema and ISM. Today, thanks to their work, mix edema is completely manageable and thyroid problems are a thing of the past.

In 1890, Dr. John Wass was the first to successfully treat mixed steamer with hormone injections. However, the mechanism by which hormones worked was still a mystery. In 1901, Dr. George Oliver invented an arterial meter which allowed him to measure the effects of adrenaline. This was a breakthrough, but the practice of offering surgery to women for conditions such as hysteria, anorexia, and anxiety was a scandalous and costly burden to society.

Doctor John Wass discusses the role of hormones in the body. He explains that, due to a misconception, women in the 1800s had their ovaries removed in order to cure various womanly ailments. However, this operation led to additional problems, and doctors eventually realized that hormones were not controlled by nerves. This revelation led to the development of the endocrine system, which provides a modern understanding of hormones' separate system of internal secretions. Finally, Starling and Gabe electret named the secretions hormones, and the term stuck.

Hormones play a vital role in the body, and their effects can be seen throughout the lifespan. Dr. John Wass explains the molecular structure of hormones, and how they function in the body. He also discusses a patient with a condition called kromagg alack gigantism, which is caused by overproduction of growth hormone.

The documentary discusses the importance of hormones, with particular focus on the role of the pituitary gland. Harvey Cushing discovered that tumors on the pituitary gland can cause a person to grow unusually tall, and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his work in this area. Chris Greener and Charles Byrne also died from untreated diabetes, and Frederick Banting was the first person to successfully treat diabetes with insulin therapy.

00:40:00
In 1922, Canadian doctor Frederick Banting discovered that insulin could be used to treat diabetes. This discovery led to a new wave of hormone research, but it also led to a wave of "bizarre fads" in medical history.

Dr. John Wass discusses the history and science of hormones in a fascinating documentary. He explains that while Stein axe technique may have been ineffective, it was a major milestone in the field of endocrinology.

John Wass discusses the role of hormones in everyday life and how they work to control everything from appetite to weight. A new system of hormone regulation was discovered in recent years, involving leptin produced by fat cells. This is a key factor in the treatment of obesity in patients who lack the ability to produce this hormone.

This video discusses the effects of hormones on human biology, and how little is currently understood about them. It discusses the history of hormones and how recent discoveries have led to a renewed understanding of their power. It reminds viewers that while hormones are only just over a century old, there is still much to learn about them.
