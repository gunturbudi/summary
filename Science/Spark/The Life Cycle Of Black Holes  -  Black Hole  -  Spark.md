This video discusses the life cycle of black holes, from their birth during a violent chain of events in the core of a large star to their eventual decay through Hawking radiation. The video explores the role that black holes play in shaping the universe and explains how they can have a profound impact on their host galaxies and beyond. The video also discusses the possibility and implications of creating black holes in a controlled lab environment.

In this section, we learn about black holes - objects so dense that nothing can escape their gravitational pull, including light. Scientists have found evidence of black holes in nearly every large galaxy, with some millions and even billions of times the mass of the sun. By studying the life cycle of black holes, scientists are finding clues to the fate that awaits our galaxy and the universe at large. They are able to do this thanks to a flash of gamma radiation observed by astronomers in 2008, which had come from halfway across the visible universe and gave scientists valuable data on the behavior of black holes.

In this section, the transcript discusses the birth of black holes, which is the end result of a violent chain of events that occurs within the core of a large star. As a star runs out of fuel, its energy flows out into space, and the resulting shrinkage leads to an inward collapse. If the star's core builds up to around 1.4 times the mass of the sun, it can no longer maintain itself against the pressure, leading to implosion. If enough matter falls onto the neutron star that is created next, which is an ultra-dense ember resulting from a supernova, beyond a critical threshold, it can be crushed down to form a black hole. Black holes are areas of space and time that are black and empty, and the matter from which they were formed has been completely destroyed, leaving behind only gravity.

little interaction from nearby galaxies, but simulations show that galaxies in more active areas can merge and create supermassive black holes at their centers. In this section of the video, scientists explain that black holes play a critical role in shaping the universe we know and have evolved alongside galaxies. By using supercomputers to simulate the sweep of cosmic history, scientists can recreate the shared history between galaxies and black holes and see what marked these early black holes left on the universe.

In this section, the video explains how astronomers use virtual simulations to understand the cosmic conditions that gave rise to black holes and galaxies. From knowing the initial condition of the universe through the WMAP observatory, Tiziana Di Matteo sets in motion a simulation covering a region of over a hundred million light-years on a side. The result depicts the intricate cosmic web with gravity drawing matter into filaments and knots on the largest of scales. Tiziana's simulation shows that black holes start to appear where filaments come together, and as they gain mass, gravity pulls them toward the densest regions where a few grow larger than all the rest. To grow large, one black hole must draw the other in close enough to swallow it, and Albert Einstein's prediction shows how they do it, transferring energy to waves that move outward along the surface or carrying energy away from the orbit itself.

In this section, we learn that during the time period when the universe was half its current age, black holes were growing rapidly due to the fact that most major mergers were occurring then. Through a simulation, we see how galaxies like our own were formed through a series of mergers and collisions, with black holes growing in size and ferocity as a result of being fed matter. While some black holes grew to an enormous size, these were rare events, and black holes didn't continue to grow rapidly all throughout the universe, but rather only in places that were dense with matter, such as the centers of galaxies. Scientists are still studying the role that black holes play in shaping the universe, and attempting to solve the mystery of the ultra-bright beacons of light from the distant universe called quasars.

In this section, the video explains how the energy and jets emanating from a black hole can have a profound impact on their host galaxies and beyond. The jets generated can push huge volumes of gas beyond the central region, which then results in new stars not being able to form. This explains why some of the largest galaxies are filled with old stars. However, black hole jets can also seed the surrounding regions with the heavy elements needed to form solar systems and planets like ours. The video then explains how the black hole's spinning motion generates magnetic fields that twist around as matter swirls in, and these fields channel some of the inflowing matter out into a pair of high-energy jets.

In this section, astrophysicist Andrew Hamilton discusses what happens when matter falls into a black hole using Einstein's equations, theorizing that falling into a black hole is equivalent to tumbling over a waterfall. The outermost region of the black hole is the event horizon, where space flows relentlessly in. If the black hole is spinning, the central region is bounded by the inner horizon. In a case defined only by Einstein's equations, an object may whip around so fast it gets flung outward, passing through what's known as a white hole and possibly into another time or place. However, there is a turbulent and chaotic milestone deep inside the black hole where all order disappears.

00:35:00
In this section, the video explains the inner horizon of a black hole, where streams of energy pass through each other very rapidly, creating a counter-streaming of material that builds up to the point where it gravitates, and that gravity accelerates those streams even faster through each other. The energy in a black hole does not dissipate, but instead, it builds on itself, rising to an extreme state known as the plank density, which is the most extreme place in our universe outside the big bang. In this state, temperatures rise to a trillion trillion times hotter than the center of our sun. Fortunately, extreme gravity holds the energy tight within the black hole's event horizon, but astronomers believe that turbulent times lie ahead as they project the continued evolution of our galaxy.

In this section, the video discusses the life cycle of black holes and how they will eventually become the last bastions of the universe. Stephen Hawking's theory on quantum physics applied to black holes predicts that they will glow with heat radiation as they decay, which will come from tiny particles emerging from the vacuum of space outside the event horizon. However, radio astronomers have yet to observe any electromagnetic pulses associated with black hole decay. The video also explores the possibility of creating black holes in a controlled lab environment to observe their decay, which would provide a unique window into the future of black holes. Physicists at Brookhaven National Lab in New York are currently using advanced technology to create a hot soup of gluons and quarks by blasting gold atoms in opposite directions at almost the speed of light.

In this section, the transcript discusses the possibility of creating black holes through the Large Hadron Collider in Europe. Some scientists believe that by colliding subatomic particles, they can create a black hole, but it would require more energy than any earthbound collider can pack. However, non-standard theories of gravitation predict that black holes can be created through this method. The discovery of black holes and their fundamental role in our universe is a major discovery of science, but if black holes have a finite lifetime, then their end will signal the end of our universe, which could be within a Google year, an unfathomable spread of time but short of forever.
