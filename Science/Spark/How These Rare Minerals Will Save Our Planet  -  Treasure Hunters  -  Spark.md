The YouTube video discusses the importance of rare earth elements, and how they are essential for green technologies. The video also discusses the difficulty of finding rare earth deposits, and the potential for an underground mine shaft to be the best option.

Detail Summary:

The periodic table is a visual representation of the elements that make up the world. There are a few rows of elements that are not quite fitting in, and are located at the bottom. These elements are rare because it was very difficult to isolate them once isolated. Some of these rare elements are used in modern technologies, such as smartphones and tablets, hybrid cars, and electric vehicles. China is the world's largest producer of rare earths, with 97% of the global supply. However, because of the way the resource is mined, China is also the leading producer of rare earths that are not rare earth metals.

The video discusses how rare earth elements are in high demand due to their use in electric cars, wind turbines, smartphones, and other technologies. Researchers are looking for new deposits of rare earths and are worried about potential damage to the ocean floor if scooping for them is done improperly.

Rare earth elements are minerals that are needed for modern technology, and until recently scientists didn't know what to do with them. In the 1800s, an inventor came up with a bright idea of using them for lighter Flint's and making incandescent mantle's for gas lamps. However, later applications were found for rare earths, including making gasoline much easier and cheaper and ruining and simpler sandwich lungs from Washburn han-shan. The price of gasoline would probably be between 10 and 30% higher than what it is right now if it weren't for rare earths.

The video discusses how rare earths are necessary for modern technologies, and explains that China has taken over most of the world market for these minerals. While it is difficult to determine the reasons for China's recent export restrictions, analysts believe it is related to environmental issues or China's power in the world economy.

The author of the YouTube video is discussing the issue of rare earths and the current shortage of the material. The author notes that because of the high prices of rare earths, many industries have been hit hard, including the magnet manufacturing industry. The author also notes that because of the strategic dependence on a single supplier, the prices of rare earths have jumped dramatically in recent months.

Bill McCollum is working on a process to recycle rare earths from magnets, which would help solve the global commodity crisis. His process is still in its infancy, but has the potential to be used on an industrial scale. Dysprosium is a heavy rare earth, which is much rarer than the light rare earths, and is present in only a few percent of the total rare earths in natural abundance in the Earth's crust. Without dysprosium, it is not possible to make magnets with heat-resistant motors for electric cars.

The author of the video discusses the importance of rare earths and their role in electric vehicles. They explain that the search for a "super magnet" is a difficult process that requires a lot of time and money, but that recent developments show that tradeoffs can be made in order to create materials with reduced amounts of expensive rare earths. The production facilities of the American sports car manufacturer Tesla are an example of something that is possible without the use of rare earths. Other manufacturers are now working on similar devices. If the price of rare earths reaches a certain point it is possible that they will abandon their use in electric vehicles.

In 2020, six percent of global electricity will come from rare earths, which equals 130 nuclear power plants. To recycle these valuable materials, researchers at MIT are using a scanning electron microscope to find even the tiniest amounts. If manufacturers realized that they were wasting valuable raw materials, they would understand that this old device is a source for making new devices.

The video discusses how rare earth metals are essential for various industries, and how they can be recycled. The narrator mentions that the prices for these minerals are increasing, and that this is prompting companies to invest in recycling technology.

00:50:00
The video discusses the benefits and drawbacks of using rare earths, and how we can work to make sure that their use does not have negative environmental effects. The speaker points out that we need to think about how these materials can be recycled and used in a more sustainable way, in order to reduce our reliance on them.
