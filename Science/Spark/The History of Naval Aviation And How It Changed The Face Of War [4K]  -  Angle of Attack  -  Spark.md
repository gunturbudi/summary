In this section of the video, we see how naval aviation has left its mark on America's history, changing the course of wars and giving birth to a new generation of pilots in the Marines. Despite questions about its practicality, extravagance, and obsolescence, the aircraft launched from carriers have become a crucial weapon in warfare. Young pilots today are learning their craft and are part of a lineage of people who have witnessed the biggest events of the 20th and 21st century, and they feel a sense of pride and responsibility in being part of something bigger.

In this section, the history of naval aviation is explored, beginning with the Americans' fascination with airplanes during air meets in the early 20th century. While the Army saw the potential of flight and quickly began purchasing airplanes, the Navy was hesitant about using them on the open sea. It wasn't until Captain Washington Irving Chambers attended an air show in search of a pilot willing to try launching an aircraft from a ship that the idea of using planes in naval warfare became a possibility. Eugene Ely, a pilot who didn't even like water nor looked like The Dashing Aviator, was convinced to attempt the experiment, and soon, a makeshift wooden deck was built to his specifications on the USS Birmingham.

00:10:00
In this section, we learn about the historic landings of airplanes on the decks of a moving ship at sea. Eugene Ely, an experienced pilot, developed the idea of using sandbags and hooks to stop the airplane once it lands on the ship's deck. Though Eugene Ely died months later in a plane crash, his inventions and ideas of flight decks, arresting gears, and tail hooks remain vital in many aircraft and are still used a century later.

00:15:00
In this section, we learn about the history of naval aviation and how it evolved from humble beginnings. Despite being initially hesitant to invest in aircraft technology, the Navy eventually embraced seaplanes for reconnaissance, but there was still a long way to go in terms of making planes faster, more maneuverable, and capable of carrying heavier payloads. Captain Washington Chambers was one of the key figures in advocating for the development of naval aviation, but it took years of persuasion and innovation to convince the conservative brass to invest in this new technology. In the end, carrier Aviation became a reality and changed the face of modern warfare forever.

00:20:00
In this section, we learn about how the final push towards carrier aviation came unexpectedly from an inter-service rivalry fueled by a Brash Army General named Billy Mitchell. Mitchell aimed to consolidate all military air power under one service, an independent Air Force under his command. In an attempt to prove that airplanes could kill ships, he orchestrated a show in which his airplanes successfully demolished a captured German battleship with a newly-invented two-thousand pound bomb. This triggered Navy leadership to embrace aviation as an adjunct to the fleet and led to the creation of the Langley, the first experimental aircraft carrier. This began the Golden Age of Naval Aviation and set the stage for the reputation of Naval Aviation to be built through dangerous and deadly experiences.

00:25:00
In this section, we learn about the history of naval aviation and how it changed the face of war. Initially seen as a job for those seeking glory, naval aviation evolved rapidly in the mid-1920s with the arrival of Admiral Joseph Mason Reeves. Reeves was a hard-charging Naval Academy football player who saw the potential of aircraft carriers as offensive weapons rather than just for reconnaissance. He believed in maximizing the number of planes that could be launched from a flight deck to bring concentrated firepower onto a target. With the arrival of two powerful battle cruisers, naval aviation began to take its place as a lethal weapon in warfare.

00:30:00
In this section, the development of aviation technology for naval warfare is explored, focusing on the carriers Lexington and Saratoga, which were loaded with almost a hundred planes each within a year of their development. The challenge of launching and landing dozens of airplanes in rapid succession on a constantly moving and shifting flight deck was described as a complex ballet choreographed by the deck department, making naval aviation a game of inches requiring precision and accuracy. The technique of dive bombing was invented for more accurate delivery of bombs, and in a series of war games called Fleet problems, naval aviation proved successful in independent operations, leading to the expansion of the Fleet of large carriers to six by the Japanese in the following decade.

00:35:00
In this section, the video discusses the history of naval aviation and highlights the significance of carrier aviation as a super weapon. The carrier force that moved toward Pearl Harbor in 1941 was the largest and most powerful in the world, and the attack on Pearl Harbor proved that carrier aviation was the future of warfare. The video also includes interviews with Naval aviators who share their experiences of flying and landing on a carrier, emphasizing the importance of skill and safety in this high-stakes environment. The video shows how the development of naval aviation has changed the face of war and how it remains a critical component of today's military operations.

00:40:00
In this section, the video discusses the experience of trap landings on aircraft carriers, where planes come to a sudden stop upon landing. This is followed by a historical overview of how naval aviation played a significant role in the outcome of World War II. After the devastation of Pearl Harbor, the US was forced to develop a carrier-based naval strategy since most of their battleships had been destroyed. American aircraft carriers held the line against Japan's Imperial Navy and were crucial in the Battle of Midway, which resulted in a significant victory for the US. The video emphasizes the transformative impact of naval aviation on modern warfare.

00:45:00
In this section, we learn about the American sortie with around 50 ships against almost 200 enemy ships during World War II. Despite the Americans' rough start with the Japanese bombers sweeping through defenses, the U.S carriers Enterprise, Hornet, and Yorktown launched their planes in hopes of attacking the Japanese carriers before they could unleash a second strike. While no torpedo scored, foreign squadrons of SBD dauntless dive bombers launched from the Enterprise and spotted three Japanese carriers, catching two by surprise and attacking them.

00:50:00
In this section of the video, we learn about the Battle of Midway, which was the most decisive single naval battle in US history. The victory at Midway was achieved by newly enlisted ordinary men who followed McCluskey on that day. This victory decisively took the Japanese Navy out of the war, and the Japanese never went on the offensive ever again. Carrier Aviation had proved itself beyond measure, and over the course of World War II, Navy airplanes would provide the dominant firepower in every important battle in the Pacific. Finally, we see young Naval Pilots training in El Centro, California, and how flying these planes is a reminder of the sacrifices made by previous generations in America's wars.

00:55:00
In this section, the transcript discusses the challenges and criticisms faced by Naval Aviation over time as it evolved alongside warfare. Despite being written off many times as impractical, too dangerous, or obsolete, a handful of daredevils and visionaries in the teens and 20s pushed through to create a super weapon that proved decisive in every major battle in the Pacific during World War II. However, the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki shattered established military doctrine, leading to the creation of a new independent Air Force that was assigned the mission for delivering atomic bombs. This left the Navy staked its future on a massive new carrier, but construction was stopped abruptly by the Secretary of Defense who declared, "there's no reason for having a Navy," which left Naval Aviation at risk of becoming extinct.

01:00:00
In this section, we learn that during the Korean War, the US was faced with the challenge of its air bases being overrun and captured by North Koreans, leaving the nation with its nearest air bases located hundreds of miles away. As a result, the military decided to dust off its World War II carriers and rush them to the Korean peninsula, marking the beginning of the use of carriers as the nation's forward-deployed airbases. This decision led to the construction of one supercarrier per year for the Navy and the Marines, eventually increasing the fleet to eight more supercarriers. However, the Korean War came with significant losses, with over 500 planes lost, and many pilots lost their lives in battle. Still, the war saw the birth of the helicopter, an ideal aircraft for rescue missions, which was successfully used to rescue the life of the first black combat Aviator, Jesse Brown.

01:05:00
In this section, we learn about the close relationship between fellow aviators Jesse Brown and Thomas Hudner, and their assigned routine mission that ended in tragedy. After Brown's plane had to make a crash landing due to loss of oil pressure, Hudner attempted to save him by making a crash landing of his own nearby. Despite their efforts, they were unable to get Brown out of his crashed plane in time and had to leave him behind. This event highlights the dangers of naval aviation and the risks that aviators face every day. Additionally, the introduction of Jets changed the game for carriers and marked a major transition in naval aviation.

01:10:00
In this section, the video explores the challenges faced by pilots during the transition from propeller planes to jets. The aircraft's high speed and the carrier's limited space posed significant safety risks for pilots, resulting in several accidents and deaths. However, three significant innovations, the angled deck, automated landing systems, and British steam catapults, mitigated the dangers and made jets practical on aircraft carriers. By the late 1950s, the US Navy's naval aviation program had become the most potent military force, and its pilots' skills were in high demand—their expertise in flying jets fueled their success in the space race, and they played a critical role in the development of the military's nuclear-capable aircraft.

01:15:00
In this section, the importance of the mobility of carrier aviation in the Cold War is explored. The Soviet Union knew where all of the US's nuclear weapons and bombers were located, but they couldn't keep track of the aircraft carriers, which could be anywhere in the world. This made carriers a major threat to the Soviets. The danger of being on a mission during this time was ever-present, and even routine surveillance played a crucial role, as evidenced by the Cuban Missile Crisis. Naval reconnaissance was extremely important in discovering the Soviet nuclear missile sites in Cuba, and it was the recon pilots who were able to capture high-resolution images of the sites, providing valuable intelligence for the US government.

01:20:00
In this section, the video discusses the turbulent era of the Vietnam War and how Naval Aviation struggled during this time. President Johnson's bombing campaign in the north, called Rolling Thunder, was not successful due to important targets being off-limits. Pilots called it rolling blunder, and they were discontent with it. The video also highlights the difficulties of fighting wars without modern technology, such as GPS and laser-guided munitions. The pilots were flying over Soviet ships in North Vietnam that were unloading materials, but they were not able to hit them due to no-fly zones.

01:25:00
In this section, we learn about the racial tensions that existed onboard the USS Kitty Hawk during the Vietnam War. The aircraft carrier represented a microcosm of American society with a classic social structure where the captain and officers are the rulers, and the enlisted men were mostly African Americans who served as working-class individuals. The crew had been deployed for over 200 days, working eight hours on and four hours off, causing tensions between the different races to grow. After a violent incident during Shore Leave, the situation spiraled out of control, resulting in an all-out riot that took 12 hours to quell.

01:30:00
In this section, the video discusses the changes in Naval Aviation that led to equal treatment and opportunities for women and minorities. The number of blacks in the Navy rose steadily after the Vietnam War, and women were finally allowed to serve their country by going to sea and becoming Navy pilots. Rosemary Mariner was one of the first women to enter pilot training and land a jet on a carrier deck. However, there were still challenges for women and minorities trying to break into Naval Aviation. The 9/11 attacks ushered in a new and difficult military mission that relied on GPS technology and the expectations of its Pilots, like Eric Doyle, who flew one of the first missions in the Iraq invasion of 2003.

01:35:00
In this section, a Navy pilot describes the intensity and focus required during a mission to destroy a missile production facility in Iraq. The pilot dropped four 2,000-pound weapons, hitting their intended targets, before facing the challenge of finding and landing on an aircraft carrier at night over the water. The reality of the situation starts to seep back in as the adrenaline drains out of the pilot's system, and the pilot feels a mix of emotions while reflecting on the experience. Although civilian casualties have decreased with the use of laser guidance and GPS, each one was still a human and propaganda loss in the Middle East.

01:40:00
In this section, the video discusses the changing role of carrier jets in conflicts that shift to the ground. As a result, naval aviators become more routine in their mission and may go on flights without ever having a tangible impact on the ground. The costs of naval aviation and technology advancements, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), lead to questions about the future of naval aviation, such as the possibility of pilots never leaving the ship and UAVs taking over missions. While certain operators believe that UAVs make the military stronger by taking the emotion out of decision-making, the end of manned aircraft may signify the end of an era in aviation and lead to a decline in worldwide basing options.

01:45:00
In this section, pilots discuss the importance of human decision-making in aviation rather than relying entirely on computers and drones. They acknowledge that while technology can be useful, it cannot replace the personal excellence and moral responsibility that comes with controlling an aircraft. They also recognize the historical significance of naval aviation and the responsibilities that come with wearing the wings of gold. Despite the challenges, they are proud to be a part of this legacy and are motivated to continue making history.
