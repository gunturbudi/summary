The video discusses the various ways in which sound can have magic-like effects. Some creatures, such as some blind people and some who can see with sound, can be enhanced by beautiful music. Zone can even change the taste of food. Sound can also burn away tumors and may soon treat Alzheimer's disease. Some people have created instruments called the cyma scope that convert sound into geometric images. The video also discusses how sound is the sense that never sleeps in the brain, and how it can be used to monitor events in the environment even while someone is dreaming.

Trevor Cox, an acoustic engineer, explains how sound can play tricks on the brain, causing echoes and turning words to mush. He demonstrates this by speaking in a room with a headlight device that mimics human hearing.

The Secret Study of Seeing with Sound is a fascinating look into the world of acoustic engineering. It provides a glimpse into how sound can be used to enhance and beautify music, speech, and other forms of communication. This video is a great introduction to the topic for anyone interested in learning more.

The video discusses how sound affects the taste of food, and how high levels of sound can be harmful to hearing. It also discusses how modern cities are noisy, and how this noise can be damaging to people's health.

The acoustic landscape of a city can be greatly affected by the noise of traffic, and the world soundscape project created a way to measure and preserve the sounds of a city. While the ringing of the Holy Rosary Cathedral can be heard up to forty blocks away, the sound of city streets in Vancouver was entirely different a century ago. This video provides a brief overview of the project and its effects.

The author takes a tour of Venice, where he hears what the city sounded like before the Industrial Revolution. He also discusses the importance of sound in cities and how it has changed over time.

The video demonstrates how bats use sonar to navigate their environment and how humans can also do the same, using clicks and echoes. The professor explains that humans and bats form 3d images of their surroundings, which helps them process information quickly.

In this video, the author discusses the secret study of seeing with sound. Researchers have found that humans can see with sound just like bats, and that hearing loss is only part of the problem. As we age, our brains process audio signals slower, making speech harder to understand.

The study is looking at how a drug can improve some perception by stimulating nerve channels in the brain. The drug is designed to make speech clearers not louder. If it actually improved their ability to hear speech and understand speech and background noise in the future, it would be a homerun for the study.

The video discusses how ultrasound can help to treat diseases and restore memory function in mice.
