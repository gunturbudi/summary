Richard Hammond's Wild Weather series explores the impact and power of wind on weather and the environment. Hammond demonstrates the effects of wind by standing in 65-70 miles per hour wind and explains how small gestures like rustling a newspaper or a garden chair flying away can occur due to wind's strength. The video shows the creation of a 10-meter high fire tornado using foam and fans. The team uses tracking technology to measure that the fire tornado is spinning at a speed of a shade over 22 miles an hour, the first time such a speed has ever been measured near the ground. Furthermore, the team attempts to retrieve data after sending a flying probe into the base of a tornado, becoming the first to ever do so. Though the probe was too damaged to recover data successfully, it is a significant advancement towards understanding the conditions in a twister.

In this section of the video, Richard Hammond introduces his series on weather and the powerful force that drives it - wind. He explains that wind is the force that almost unnoticed moves around us, creating much of the extreme weather on the planet. Hammond travels to Mount Washington in the US, where one of the fastest wind speeds ever recorded was measured, hitting 231 miles an hour. Despite the dangers of extreme weather such as frostbite, Hammond prepares for further experiments to show just how fast and powerful wind can be.

In this section, Richard Hammond explains the power of wind and demonstrates the effects of it by standing in 65-70 miles per hour wind for the audience. He explains how small gestures like rustling a newspaper or a garden chair flying away can happen due to the strength of the wind. The place where he stands is the site of the most exposed area, which should make it the windiest place on Pole Mountain. Richard explains the importance of storm systems and long-distance weather patterns on this occasion.

In this section, Richard Hammond explains why it's so windy at the top of a hill and how to predict weather changes by observing clouds. He illustrates how the wind is forced through the gap between the top of a mountain and the troposphere, speeding up as it goes through a narrower gap. Hammond shares a weather forecasting trick involving clouds: if clouds are moving from right to left, the weather is going to improve, and if from left to right, it's going to get worse. The next morning, Hammond ventures back outside and describes how ice crystals carried in the air by the wind freeze tight to the first object they touch, gradually building outwards in the direction they blew in from.

In this section, Richard Hammond explores the concept of a vortex and how it affects extreme weather conditions. He starts by observing the swirling patterns of confetti created by the wind and mentions that all extreme weather conditions including hurricanes, dust devils, and water spills are based on this vortex path. Hammond then travels to the tinder dry forests of Western Australia to build and examine a fire whirl, which is a vortex made entirely of flames. He is accompanied by two of the world's leading authorities on fire whirls, but the fact that it is their first full-scale build worries him. They explain that they are trying to create a fire whirl on top of baking pans by putting a combustible liquid in them and arranging them in an L shape.

00:20:00
In this section, Richard Hammond works with a team to create a spinning vortex of fire. To create a swirling motion, they need asymmetry, which is why they arrange 30 baking tins in an L-shape configuration. The team will use a remote-controlled copter to capture the wind patterns at work, and they will introduce colored smoke to see if the eye in the sky can capture these patterns. The team uses a flammable liquid called heptane to fill the pans and then sets them on fire to create a massive fire. Heat can create winds, which makes a massive fire the best way to create an extreme wind.

00:25:00
In this section, the team attempts to create a 10-meter high fire tornado to see how it works. They start by lighting up 30 baking tins and as cold air rushes in, the flames grow higher and turn into a real-life fire world. Hai, the helicopter pilot, even gets close enough to the fire tornado to see how it works. To visualize how the fire tornado starts, the team introduces smoke and observes how it behaves around the L shape. Ultimately, they successfully capture the fire whirl on camera, and it's revealed that natural fire whirls occur when two separate fire fronts meet, creating their own opposing wings.

In this section, Richard Hammond discusses the danger of tornadoes and why their spin speed is still a mystery to scientists. He visits the president of the Center for Severe Weather Research in Boulder, Colorado to ask why measuring the spin speed of a tornado is so challenging. The strongest winds in a tornado are below 10 meters, which makes it difficult to measure using remote sensing with radars, as debris pieces of houses and cows flying around in the tornado block the radar. Scientists also find it hard to get something inside the tornado to collect data as the tornado is moving unpredictably and can destroy the object. Understanding the spin speed data of a tornado can help engineers build better buildings and create better shelters that can save lives.

In this section of the transcript, Richard Hammond visits the Wind Engineering Energy and Environment Research Institute, also known as "Windy," to witness the creation of a 10-meter high fire tornado. Windy is the only facility in the world that can duplicate the dynamics of a real-life tornado, using 106 giant fans hidden behind the walls and ceiling of the building. Hammond requests to experiment with measuring the speed of the wind and introduces pink foam squares to track their progress inside the tornado. After several failed attempts to get something to fly inside the tornado, they use foam squares and try to get them trapped in the tornado's rotation to time their full lap, but it requires a lot of effort and luck.

In this section of the video, the host and his team successfully create a 10-meter high fire tornado using foam and fans. They use tracking technology to measure that it is spinning at a speed of a shade over 22 miles an hour, which is the first time such a speed has ever been measured near the ground. With this knowledge, they begin to plan on how they can get the technology to fly inside a real tornado. After some failed attempts on his own, the host meets a scientist who shows him the Dominator 3, a hand-built tornado-proof armored car that they will use to measure the speed of a tornado near the ground.

00:45:00
In this section, Richard Hammond and storm chaser Reed Timmer explain the significance of understanding the rotational wind speed of a tornado, which directly impacts the damage it causes to structures. They discuss the level of risk involved in getting close to a tornado, which begs the question of whether Timmer is a scientist and adrenaline junkie or a lunatic. They examine the Dominator vehicle and the possibility of firing a data recording probe into a tornado to measure its rotational wind speed. They recall the F5 tornado that hit the same area and recorded the strongest wind speeds ever on the planet at over 300 miles an hour, causing over a billion dollars in damage. Finally, they explain how they plan to park next to a real-life tornado with the Dominator vehicle and fire a probe into its heart to measure its rotational wind speed.

00:50:00
In this section, the team attempts to get a probe inside a 10-meter-high fire tornado to collect data on its wind speed. They manage to get it in, but retrieving it proves to be challenging. The team locates the damaged probe and is ecstatic about their success, even though retrieving the data would have to wait as they were unable to do it on location. The team eagerly awaits the opportunity to analyze the data retrieved from the fire tornado to gain a better understanding of the conditions in the twister.

00:55:00
In this section, the team successfully manages to send a flying probe into the base of a tornado, becoming the first to ever do so. Despite the probe being too damaged to recover much data, it is still a significant achievement in the field of weather science. By observing the way winds start to spin and how these spinning winds are the basis for extreme weather, the team has gained greater insight into weather patterns and is one step closer to uncovering the mystery of how fast a tornado can spin.
