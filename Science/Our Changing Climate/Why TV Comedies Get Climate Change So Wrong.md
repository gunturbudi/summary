The video explores how TV comedies have historically portrayed climate change and environmentalism in a problematic way that trivializes the issue, casts doubt on its existence, and discourages action. It points out that while some shows have incorporated skeptical characters, South Park has promoted climate denial the most. The video suggests that TV writers can do better by following science communication best practices to create comedy around climate change that has social impact and doesn't age poorly. The video stresses the importance of evidence-based, science-led coverage of climate change in television shows, particularly as Joe Biden's climate policy is promising but requires public support.

In this section, the video explains how television comedies often trivialize climate change and frame it in a way that casts doubt on its existence, treats activists as scam artists, and discourages action. The video analyzes how climate change is framed in sitcoms of the past 30 years and found that in the 90s, most shows highlighted the positive side to warmer weather while others centered on the perceived obnoxiousness of environmentalists. The humor in this approach came from the outlandish and extreme environmental views expressed by these characters, which made their perspective less valid than the main characters. However, these framing began to die out in the 2010s as awareness of the true impact of climate change increased.

In this section, the video discusses the problematic portrayal of climate change and environmentalism in TV comedies. It mentions how shows often depict environmentalists as obnoxious and easily dismissible, while characters who take climate action are often portrayed as extreme or abnormal. This framing can lead to skepticism about motives and disinterest in learning more about the issue. Moreover, while some shows incorporate characters who are skeptical of climate change, none promote climate denial more than South Park. The video argues that TV writers can do better by following best practices from science communication to make climate change a solvable problem that can inspire action.

In this section, it is suggested that writers can produce comedy centered around climate change that has social impact and doesn't age poorly. By focusing on a local climate issue of personal relevance to the main character and having the character find success in making a change, viewers are encouraged to take action. From 2010 to 2015, there was almost no discussion of climate change in television comedies, which is less than any other five-year time period since 1990. It's important for television shows to engage with climate change coverage in an evidence-based, science-led way without alarming the public, particularly as Joe Biden's climate policy is promising but cannot operate in a vacuum.
