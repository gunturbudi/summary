The fast fashion industry has emerged due to capitalism, which has led to worker exploitation, environmental destruction, and wastefulness. Clothing brands use exclusivity, belonging, power, and self-worth as marketing tools, making clothes more desirable and expensive. Fast fashion exploits workers by squeezing them under deadly conditions and pushing waste onto the environment. The textile industry produces vast amounts of waste and uses an estimated 79 trillion liters of water a year. The production of clothes must change to end fast fashion. The author argues that collective action among textile workers and consumer boycotts must be implemented to create a future with ethical and environmentally sound clothing practices. The end of capitalism is necessary to end fast fashion, with a socialist economic model involving communal ownership of textile factories led by worker democracy as the sustainable alternative. Harm-reduction strategies could be implemented while workers build power and establish solidarity networks across industries.

In this section, the transcript excerpt explores the history of the fashion industry, particularly its emergence during the industrial revolution, which led to capitalist exploitation and drove textile mills to use young girls and women as factory workers up to 100 hours per week in terrible conditions. At the same time, enslaved Black people were working for cotton plantation capitalists, which contributed to the massive profits of factory and farm owners. The lower the wages of these exploited workers, the more waste factory owners could dump and the more profits they could make. This ultimately led the industry to become based on fast fashion, where clothes are produced cheaply and quickly, leading to environmental destruction and worker exploitation.

In this section, it is explained that capitalism plays a major role in the fast fashion industry. Clothing, as a symbol of exclusivity, belonging, power, and self-worth, is sold by attaching these values to the garments in advertisements, making them more desirable and expensive. Clothing brands constantly change their collections, keeping the consumers one step behind, and creating a culture of pressure to keep up with trends. Fast fashion thrives by squeezing workers under deadly conditions and pushing waste onto the environment. The global textile industry is driven by a constant desire to gain profits, with little regard for resilience and the well-being of employees. The collapse of Rana Plaza is one of many factory disasters that highlight the dangerous and inhumane working conditions faced by millions of workers, mostly women and children of color, in the imperial periphery.

In this section, the detrimental effects of fast fashion on the planet and workers are discussed. The textile industry produces a vast amount of waste and uses an estimated 79 trillion liters of water a year, with total carbon emissions ranging from 2-8% of total global emissions. The author argues that the problem of environmental damage and worker exploitation resides with the production of clothes, rather than consumers alone. To end fast fashion, the author argues that textile workers must collectivize and agitate for better working conditions and pay. Consumers can show solidarity by boycotting and divesting from fast fashion. The solution lies in changing the conditions within the factory and the way we produce clothes.

In this section, the video suggests that ending capitalism is necessary to end fast fashion. A future with ethical and environmentally sound clothing practices involves a model where textile factories are communally owned by workers who democratically decide what to make. In this socialist economic model, production is not about how much can be made and sold, but how much is needed for comfort and happiness. This would lead to an end of over-production, waste, pollution, and exploitation that are essential ingredients to fashion under capitalism. However, to make this happen, workers must build power, organize, and establish networks of solidarity across industries. While building that power, harm-reduction strategies, such as using hemp fibers instead of synthetic materials, could be implemented.
