Ecosia is a search engine that focuses on planting trees instead of owning half of the internet. Its search results and ads are powered by Microsoft's Bing, which some people criticize for being environmentally harmful. However, Microsoft has committed to a 75% reduction in carbon emissions across its whole operation by 2030, and Ecosia's tree planting projects are essentially carbon negative. Additionally, the switch from Google to Ecosia is not difficult and the way Charlie sees it, Ecosia is an easy way to bring a little bit of green back into the world.
