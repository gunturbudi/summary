The video discusses the problems associated with consumerism and how it hampers green growth. The American culture of consumerism and purchasing, particularly during Christmas, leads people to purchase unnecessary items that do not increase their well-being after basic needs are met. The video also suggests that the blame should not be placed solely on individuals, but on corporations and companies that incentivize overconsumption. The video cites a study recommending that reducing consumption levels and using technology to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy is necessary to achieve zero-carbon living. Governments and corporations have a role to play to reduce consumption levels and tackle climate change.

In this section, the video explores the issue of consumption and how it contributes to the failure of green growth strategies. The video highlights how the consumerist culture in America, particularly during the Christmas period, leads to individuals purchasing unnecessary items in the hopes of finding happiness or political change. However, studies have shown that once people's basic needs are met, purchasing more items does not increase their well-being. Additionally, the video argues that the blame for overconsumption should not solely be placed on individuals but corporations and companies who have a vested interest in making people buy more by slapping green labels on their products. The video concludes that the capitalist growth model, which prioritizes consumption, is not the solution to climate change.

In this section, the video discusses how consumerism and economic growth can lead to an increase in carbon emissions and why reducing consumption must be an integral part of efforts to tackle climate change. The video cites a study that suggests that the world could support three times the current global population if global consumption levels dropped 60% down to 1960 levels while still maintaining a decent lifestyle. The researchers suggest that reducing consumption levels should be coupled with massive rollouts of advanced technology in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and other sectors to allow the global population to live well in a zero-carbon world. The burden of achieving a drop in consumption should not lie upon individuals but on governments and corporations that created the mess in the first place.
