In the video, "How We Can Build A Solarpunk Future Right Now," the artist Andrewism discusses how we can create a future based on the principles of Solarpunk. Solarpunk is a movement that emphasizes environmentalism, community solidarity, and technology that is accessible and tangible. Some of the technologies mentioned in the video include Earthships, which are environmentally sustainable homes made from recycled materials, and sailing cargo, which is a zero-carbon shipping method. While some of these technologies already exist, they are not prevalent due to capitalism. Patreon supporters are essential to Our Changing Climate, the YouTube channel where this video is featured, as they help to finance creative risks and difficult topics.

This video discusses how we can build a future based on the tenets of Solarpunk, which emphasizes environmentalism, community solidarity, and technology that is both accessible and tangible. Some of the technologies mentioned include Earthships, which use recycled materials and are built to be environmentally sustainable.

In the 21st century, Solarpunk envisages a world in which the technologies we use help us to appreciate the rhythms of the planet, including sailing. Sam Merrett runs a zero-carbon shipping company using sailing, and this example epitomizes a Solarpunk future.

The video features Andrewism, a Solarpunk artist, and talks about how we can build a Solarpunk future right now. Although Earthships and sailing cargo do exist in this world, they aren't prevalent due to capitalism. Some of these technologies are still in development, but when it comes to these beautiful Solarpunk worlds that artists around the world have begun to render, I can't help but think about capitalism. The profit-centered global economy we've built has driven us to create technologies that, for the most part, function to expand margins and make more money for the capitalist class. Ideas and inventions that can't compete in the market, regardless of whether they are zero-carbon or build community health, are pushed to the margins. Patreon supporters are the financial backbone of Our Changing Climate's operation, without them I wouldn't be able to take creative risks and dive into difficult topics.
