The video discusses the problem of Black Friday, which is a day where companies slash their prices in order to lure customers into their stores. This consumption-centric day of sales has become less popular over time, as shoppers are increasingly choosing to browse online instead. The rise of online shopping has also led to increased wastefulness, as more packages are shipped and burned during transportation. Black Friday and Cyber Monday reflect and perpetuate social problems, such as the rise of needless consumption.

Noam Chomsky discusses the problem with Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which are allegedly good for people without much disposable income but in fact contribute to the exploitation of working-class people. He encourages greater participation in the social movements for justice, such as the Sunrise movement or indigenous climate action, that already exist. Only when we create new modes of operating beyond a profit centric model will we be able to form healthier cultural norms that attempt to foster what the holiday season is supposed to be about.
