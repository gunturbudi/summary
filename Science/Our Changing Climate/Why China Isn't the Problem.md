# Summary of Why China Isn't the Problem

The video explains that China is not solely responsible for climate change, as historical and cumulative emissions from the US and Europe have had a greater impact. While China has high annual emissions, it is also the most populous country in the world and is relatively efficient in emissions per capita. China has made efforts towards renewable energy, investing over $546 billion into low-carbon infrastructure and doubling the share of electricity derived from renewable sources. However, some critics argue that their plans are not ambitious enough to achieve emissions reduction targets. The transition to green energy has led to the hyper-exploitation of minerals in the Democratic Republic of Congo, leading to environmental destruction. Overall, the video highlights the need for state intervention to transition to a zero-carbon economy.

In this section, the video argues that China's politics and economics are not set in stone, and its economy is a mix of state-owned and privately-owned enterprises that function within a profit-oriented market. While there is debate over whether China has become more socialist or more capitalist, its ultimate path will have a significant impact on global emissions. However, when viewed historically, China was not always the biggest polluter. For most of the last two centuries, the United States and England were the biggest emitters of carbon dioxide, which have locked the world into soaring past the maximum amount of CO2 emissions. Therefore, when considering carbon emissions, they must be considered cumulatively, and not only in terms of current emissions.

In this section, the video explains why China isn't solely responsible for climate change. The US and Europe are the main culprits due to their historical and cumulative emissions. Although China has high annual emissions, it is also the most populous country in the world and is actually pretty efficient when it comes to emissions per capita. Furthermore, the CO2 emissions from China's coal plants are largely due to the production of exports consumed by Americans and Europeans. However, China is still on an unsustainable path due to an increase in fossil fuel output, primarily through the construction of bigger coal plants and expanding oil pipeline infrastructure. The Chinese government recognizes the issue and has made efforts towards renewable energy, such as the Golmud solar park, but the question remains whether they are doing enough to curb emissions and tackle climate change.

In this section, the transcript introduces China's commitment to renewable energy and clean infrastructure. By investing over $546 billion into low carbon infrastructure, China is set to rapidly move towards a zero carbon economy. China has already made significant strides towards renewable energy, with the share of electricity derived from renewable sources doubling and the share from fossil fuels dropping by 14% since 2011. In addition to wind and solar, China is also leading the way in battery power and electric transportation, as well as tree planting projects to sequester carbon. However, Climate Action Tracker deems that the country's five year plans and clean energy projects are not ambitious enough to achieve the necessary emissions reduction targets. Nonetheless, China's initiatives reveal the possibilities and the need for state intervention in transitioning to a zero carbon economy.

In this section, it is discussed how China's transition into green energy has led to an insatiable appetite for minerals found in the Democratic Republic of Congo, including cobalt, which has led to hyper exploitation, imperialism, and environmental destruction.
