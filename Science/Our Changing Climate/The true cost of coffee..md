The video "The true cost of coffee" discusses the negative environmental impacts of industrial coffee production, which relies on chemical herbicides and pesticides resulting in deforestation, erosion and pollution. In contrast, the traditional method of shade-grown coffee cultivation is more sustainable, environmentally friendly, and economically sustainable for local farmers. However, the shift to the industrial method has been encouraged by organizations like the World Bank, and the solution requires a global economy that prioritizes environmental health, communal well-being, and quality goods. The video promotes the streaming service Nebula and invites viewers to support the creators on Patreon.

In this section, the video explores the environmental impact of coffee production, which reaches beyond the waste of to-go cups. The global addiction to coffee has led to a stark split between consumer and producer countries, with countries like the US, Germany, and France primarily importing coffee while the biggest producers such as Brazil, Vietnam, and Colombia are situated in the global south. Industrial coffee production methods have resulted in sun-grown coffee, which is reliant on chemical herbicides and pesticides, leading to ecological issues like erosion, pollution, and deforestation. This method demands high yields and low prices at the expense of the environment and community. Shade-grown coffee cultivation, on the other hand, is a sustainable alternative that existed until recently, which protects other trees and supports local farmers.

In this section, the focus is on the environmental benefits of the traditional system of growing coffee in a biodiverse landscape, rather than the industrial system of monoculture. Shade-grown coffee, which allows coffee plants to thrive in their ideal habitat of shade and intercropped with fruit or nut trees, requires fewer chemicals and mechanized input, and also helps to reduce deforestation and sequester carbon. In addition to being environmentally sustainable, traditional coffee growing also provides farmers with more economic security and a more diverse harvest. However, the transition to an environmentally destructive practice is happening due to the influence of free market-oriented organizations like the World Bank, which have created conditions for the switch to larger global economies of industrialized farms. Therefore, the solution is not as simple as just buying single origin shade-grown varieties, but rather a global economy that prioritizes environmental health, communal well-being, and quality goods.

In this section, the video promotes a streaming service called Nebula that was built by independent creators, such as CGP Grey and Wendover Productions, to experiment and expand their reach with short, easily consumable original series. Nebula is described as a complement to Curiosity Stream, a platform that offers access to thousands of high-quality documentaries, and viewers can sign up for a year of the service for as low as $2.99 a month using the offer code OCC. Additionally, the video invites viewers to support the creator on Patreon to receive early access to videos and help choose a nonprofit organization to donate to each month.
