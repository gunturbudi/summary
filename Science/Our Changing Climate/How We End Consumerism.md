# Summary of How We End Consumerism

Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=omcUaD8pxaY

The video discusses the issue of overconsumption caused by consumerism and capitalist growth, which has a negative impact on individuals and the environment. While minimalism and zero waste are popular ways to counter consumption, they lack a structural approach that addresses the system itself. Degrowth is an anticapitalist framework that aims to reduce consumption, production, and GDP to create a sustainable and equitable society. The concept of degrowth ultimately requires systemic pathways at the policy level and reverting back to 1960s levels of consumption means a life that centers people and experience in well-being instead of relying on extra stuff to manage our emotional health. Degrowth requires ecosocialism where reducing consumption bubbles up democratically from the masses who have full democratic control of the workplace and state.

In this section, the video explores the issues of consumerism and capitalist growth, which have led to overconsumption in the Global North and the detrimental impact on both individuals and the environment. While some people turn to minimalism or zero waste as a way to counter consumerism, these lifestyle choices lack a structural approach that addresses the system itself. This is where degrowth comes in, as an anticapitalist framework that aims to reduce consumption, production, and GDP to create a sustainable and equitable society. The video argues that degrowth is a viable solution to end consumerism and address the urgent need for zero-carbon emissions.

In this section, the concept of degrowth and its goals have been introduced. Degrowth aims to decrease overconsumption and production of goods that do not fulfill real needs like housing, health, education, transport, and arts. The idea is to achieve a contraction of rich countries and increase well-being for poorer countries. The call to buy less, repair, reduce meat consumption, and eliminate unnecessary marketing are some ways to reduce consumption but degrowth ultimately requires systemic pathways at the policy level. The paper asserts that reverting back to 1960s levels of consumption would mean a 1960s lifestyle for everyone on the planet; a life for all that centers people and experience in well-being instead of relying on extra stuff to manage our emotional health. However, degrowth cannot happen under state capitalism and instead requires ecosocialism where reducing consumption bubbles up democratically from the masses who have full democratic control of the workplace and state.

In this section, the video notes the need for an ecosocialist degrowth intervention to address the continued increase in global consumption and capitalist decoupling. It questions why we prioritize work over other aspects of life and why we choose to purchase instead of repair items.
