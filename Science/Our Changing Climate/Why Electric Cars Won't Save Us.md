The author of the video discusses the benefits and drawbacks of electric cars, noting that they would require significantly more renewables to make up for added electricity demand. He also points out that cities need to be designed around people, not cars, and that this kind of degrowth won't happen overnight. In addition, he suggests that transportation infrastructure be redesigned to make public transportation more appealing.
