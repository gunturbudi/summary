The video discusses the differences between the response to COVID-19 and climate change, noting that while the former is an immediate threat and has spurred swift action, the latter is a gradual threat that is often doubted due to the lack of direct cause-and-effect. However, the video suggests that the COVID-19 response teaches us about the connection between emissions and the economy, and presents evidence that China's response to the virus temporarily decreased CO2 emissions by a quarter. The video emphasizes that rapid structural change is possible and necessary to drastically cut emissions, and that social safety nets must be put in place to avoid harming millions. Ultimately, the section concludes by stressing the need to treat climate change like the crisis that it is and to have the courage to break away from the status quo to take action.

In this section, the video discusses the differences between the global response to COVID-19 and climate change. While the coronavirus is an immediate threat and has spurred swift action, climate change is a gradual threat that is often scrutinized and doubted due to the lack of direct cause-and-effect. However, the video suggests that there are still lessons to be learned from the COVID-19 response, particularly in the connection between emissions and the economy. The video presents evidence that China's aggressive response to the virus temporarily decreased CO2 emissions by a quarter, potentially reducing air pollution-related deaths.

In this section, the video highlights that the Coronavirus pandemic shows that rapid and drastic structural change is possible in the face of a crisis. The response to the virus has demonstrated that planned economic slowdowns, such as reducing travel and embracing video chats, are not only possible but necessary to drastically cut emissions. However, this type of rapid structural change needs to incorporate strong social safety nets such as a clean jobs guarantee, free public transit, and low-cost public housing systems to avoid hurting millions. This section concludes by stressing that climate change needs to be treated like the crisis that it is, and we need to have the courage to break away from the status quo and take action.
