The video discusses Ireland's population history, which has seen a continuous decline since the 1800s. Around 36 million Americans claim Irish ancestry, which indicates the influence of Irish immigrants on American culture. The video also mentions that Ireland is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, and that its population is now the third-fastest growing on the European continent.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
The Republic of Ireland today has a population of 5 million, which ranks it as only the 26th largest nation in Europe, and 122nd largest in the world. Though its population is only the 26th largest in Europe, the Irish economy is the 14th largest and Irish citizens earned the 10th highest incomes on the continent. The Irish economy is larger and stronger than most bigger nations in the world, but Ireland more than any other country in the 21st century world has a major problem deep within its past that has kept their country from expanding beyond the mere middle power it is in Europe. The 21st century Irish are working with a seriously bad historical handicap that continues to limit their Island's potential to this day.

Ireland experienced a population crash in the mid-19th century due to a combination of factors, most notably the potato blight and the resulting famine. By the end of the century, almost three-fourths of the population had fled the island.

Ireland is projected to have a population of just over 8 million people by the late 2030s, due to rapidly increasing rates of population growth. If Earth's rate of population growth continues at this rate, Ireland may finally reach its pre-famine population.
