# Summary of Germany's Catastrophic Gas Problem

Germany is in the midst of a gas crisis due to a decline in Russian gas supplies. The country is trying to quickly build offshore floating LNG facilities to import gas from other countries, but these projects are running behind schedule and are expensive. If the gas supply from Russia were to decline further, it could have serious consequences for the German economy.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Germany is heavily reliant on Russian gas imports, and the war in Ukraine has caused a significant decrease in Russian gas supplies. To make up for the shortfall, the Germans have been forced to pay higher prices for Russian gas, and the Russians are now artificially cutting their own supplies to the Germans in order to increase the price. This is causing major economic problems for Germany.

Germany is facing a crisis due to high gas prices, which have increased tenfold in the past decade. The German government has decided to phase out coal as an energy source, in order to replace it with cleaner, renewable energy. However, this is proving to be difficult, as wind and solar power are not prevalent in Germany.

Germany relies heavily on imported natural gas, which is in high demand because of Germany's industrial economy. However, because of technological advances, solar energy only accounts for four percent of Germany's total energy supply. Other renewable sources, like hydro, are even less in total. Non-nuclear renewable sources make up around 20 percent of Germany's energy consumption, but oil and gas still dominate. The Netherlands and Norway are the third and second largest sources of natural gas to Germany, but the Netherlands' gas supply is coming to an end. The drilling for gas within the Groningen field ended up causing sustainability issues, which has caused unrest among the local residents. The Dutch government is now imposing serious restrictions on gas production within the field in order to phase it out gradually. The plan is to end gas production completely within the field between 2025 and 2028.

In 2005, Gerhard Schroeder, the second Chancellor of Germany, negotiated a deal with Russia to construct a new gas pipeline, Nordstream, which would transport gas directly from Russian fields to Germany. Schroeder, who had been voted out of office a few months earlier, signed the deal hastily. Nordstream was completed in 2011, and since then, it has been supplying Germany with 20% of their natural gas needs. In 2017, Schroeder was nominated to serve as the independent director of the board of directors for Rosneft, a Russian state-owned oil company, and in 2022, he was nominated to the board of directors of Gazprom, the Russian state-owned natural gas company. Schroeder has been earning an estimated 1 million dollars a year from Russia for his positions within all of these state-owned oil and gas companies.

In just a decade, nuclear power's share of electricity in Germany had fallen from a third to just 13 percent, due to a combination of factors including the push towards renewable energy, the closure of three nuclear plants, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In response, the German government announced in September that it will keep two of the final three nuclear plants running just a little bit longer.

00:25:00
In December of 2019, the Trump Administration slapped sanctions on the completion of a $11 billion pipeline that would have doubled Germany's direct imports of gas from Russia. In response, the Germans announced that they would scrap the pipeline entirely. Germany is currently operating under the assumption that by the winner of the Russian gas delivery race through their pipeline network will be effectively zero, and so the race has been on to secure enough alternative supplies to get them through the winter.

The video discusses Germany's gas problem, which is caused by a decline in Russian gas supplies. The country is currently trying to quickly build offshore floating LNG facilities to import gas from other countries. However, these projects are running years behind schedule and are expensive. If the gas supply from Russia were to decline further, it could have serious consequences for the German economy.

The video discusses Germany's gas problem, which is caused by the world's largest chemicals production complex. If the facility is unable to find enough natural gas, it may have to temporarily shut down. This could have a major impact on the German economy, and possibly other countries that rely on German manufacturing. The German government is working on a solution, but it is unclear how long the conflict will last.
