# Summary of Why You Canâ€™t Measure the Coastline of Britain

The coastline of the United Kingdom is notoriously difficult to measure due to its complex coastline. The coastline paradox is a mathematical principle that states that the length of a coastline is more complex than the span of that coastline, meaning that the more open the coastline is, the longer the coastline is. This has important implications on global geopolitics, as one example, during the late 19th century dispute between the United States and the United Kingdom over the border between Alaska and Canada, each party used a different method to measure the coastline, resulting in wildly different claims.

Detail Summary:

The coastline of the United States is 29,093 miles long, but the coastline of Norway is reportedly 51,748 miles long. The discrepancy between these two lengths is due to the complexity of the coastline, which is dominated by jagged fjords and islands. The length of a country's coastline can be estimated by measuring the length of several equally-sized segments around the perimeter of the country.

Today, the coastline paradox is still a problem in cartography, as different methods of measuring a coastline can produce wildly different results.

In this video, the coastline of Britain is discussed. The video explains that the length of the coastline is an estimate and is based on the biases and methods used by the person or organization that did the measuring. The video also explains that the coastline paradox and the beauty of geometry are explored through today's sponsor, Brilliant.
