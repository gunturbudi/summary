Djibouti's strategic location at the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, which is crucial to maritime trade, makes it an important geopolitical hotspot. The strait plays a vital role in ensuring a steady supply of oil, gas, and manufactured goods to Europe and the US, making it a potential target for outside powers to construct their military bases to protect their interests in the region and ensure continued global trade flow. Djibouti's stability in a region full of conflicts has earned it outsized power and influenced over Ethiopia and the globalized trade network, resulting in the presence of American, French, Italian, Japanese, German, Spanish, Saudi Arabian, and Chinese military bases. Saudi Arabia has a particular interest in building an overseas military base in Djibouti to free up the Strait of Hormuz, which is under constant threat from Iran and Houthi rebels in Yemen.

In this section, it is explained how Djibouti's location at the western side of the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, which is crucial to maritime trade, makes it an important geopolitical hotspot. As the Gulf region contains a highly concentrated amount of oil and natural gas reserves, the Persian Gulf is the most important location on the planet, with Persian Gulf oil and natural gas entering the Indian Ocean through the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, passing Djibouti, and traveling west to ports across Europe. As it is a crucial chokepoint for maritime trade, every great power has established a military base in Djibouti, making it the country with the highest per capita concentration of foreign military bases in the world.

In this section, it is discussed why Djibouti is home to military bases of various countries, including Saudi Arabia. The country has critical importance to the Saudis because it is the easiest way of exporting their oil to global markets. However, the Strait of Hormuz, which is the most common route for Saudi oil, is vulnerable and is under the constant threat of being shut down by Iran. The Civil War in Yemen also poses a threat to Saudi oil exports as the houthis block the Babelmandeb Strait. Saudi Arabia has been attacking the houthis and is interested in building its overseas military base in Djibouti to free the Strait up as soon as possible.

In this section, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which connects the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden, is examined in terms of its global importance as a critical Maritime choke point that keeps the pace of globalized trade alive and well. The strait plays a vital role in ensuring a steady supply of oil, gas, and manufactured goods to Europe and the US. Unfortunately, it is located in a geopolitically turbulent neighborhood with countries like Yemen, Eritrea, and Somalia, all experiencing some level of fragility and instability, which puts Maritime shipping through the choke point into jeopardy, threatening the economies and security of countries dependent on it.

In this section, it is explained that Djibouti's strategic location near the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait makes it an important location for outside powers to construct their military bases to protect their interests in the region and ensure the continued flow of global trade through the dangerous neighborhood. Djibouti's relative stability in a region of the world usually full of conflicts has made it a suitable location for these military bases. Djibouti's location and relative stability within its challenging neighborhood grant it outsized power and influence over Ethiopia and the globalized trade network, making it a potentially lucrative target to many outside powers. Djibouti has welcomed military-grade powers from all around the world to set up their bases there and dissuade any potential hostile outside power from ever trying anything funny, hence the presence of American, French, Italian, Japanese, German, Spanish, Saudi Arabian, and Chinese military bases in Djibouti.
