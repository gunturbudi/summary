The video discusses the potential for Russia to invade Ukraine again, this time through Belarus. Belarus has allowed the Russian military to build up around 30,000 troops on its southern border, and recent Western satellite images have shown increased military activity in Belarus near the Ukrainian border. It is estimated that around 20,000 Russian troops have entered Belarus, and it is possible that a second Russian attack against Kiev is imminent. Belarus' ideology and goals have been to preserve Belarus as a miniature version of the Soviet Union, and its economy is still largely owned by the state. Lukashenko has sidelined the Belarusian language in favor of Russian, and Russian is the dominant language in nearly every aspect of public life. Belarus has been ranked 28th from the bottom out of all the world's countries in press freedoms.

The video discusses why Belarus might invade Ukraine, citing the country's recent history of fraud in favor of President Lukashenko and the large number of people (5% of the Belarusian population) who have taken to the streets in protest. Belarus has responded by generating another crisis, this time by threatening to flood the EU with migrants.

Belarus is a country located in Central Europe, between Germany and Russia. It has a population of approximately 9.5 million people. Despite being a neutral country, Belarus has been a part of several wars in the past, most notably the Second World War, and is still sensitive to the deaths of its soldiers. In 2018, a British think tank found that 79% of Belarussians believe that the deaths of their soldiers in Ukraine would be an unacceptable cost for their country to bear. This reluctance to send troops to fight alongside of the Russians has bought Belarus some good will among the Belarussians, but would be immediately soured if he changed his mind and sent them in. There have been at least 80 reported incidents of Belarussians resisting the Russian occupation of their country since the war began.

The video discusses how, based on recent events, it seems as though Belarus may invade Ukraine in order to help the Ukrainian government fight against Soviet-era authoritarianism. If Ukraine emerges victorious, it is possible that Lukashenko will lose his biggest backer, and may lose his own power.

Today's sponsor, Ren, offers an easy way to calculate your own carbon footprint and reduce it by finding diverse carbon reduction projects. As someone from California with direct family members in the state who've been forced to evacuate their homes due to approaching wildfires, I'm particularly interested in their projects supporting biochar in California. Biochar is aimed at preventing future wildfires in the state by removing dead inflammable trees and turning those dead trees into biomass. It will take a lot from all of us to end the climate crisis, and Ren is what I'll be using going forward for all of my own personal carbon offsetting. It's probably costs a lot less than you think, and it's even less considering that when you click the button here on your screen right now or head to the link down in the description below, they'll actually pay to offset the first month of emissions for the first 100 people who sign up. It's a great way to genuinely help fight against the climate crisis and help support real life lore at the same time. Thank you so much for watching.
