# Summary of South Africaâ€™s Catastrophic Water Problem

Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=5TuZlEy_HFk

This video discusses Cape Town's catastrophic water problem caused by a three-year drought that started in 2015, which depleted the city's water reservoirs, leading to a water apocalypse. This crisis was exacerbated by factors such as a rapidly growing population, inadequate water infrastructure, and tensions between local and national government factions. The city implemented strict water restrictions, which helped to conserve water, but the potential threat of future water shortages remains. The video highlights the need for cities and countries to invest in water storage and infrastructure, and among the solutions being pushed is a much-debated plan to tap into underground reserves.

In this section, it is explained how Cape Town, South Africa, was on the brink of being the first major city to run out of water in 2018 due to the worst drought in decades in the region. Cape Town's water supply is primarily based on a series of six modern dams constructed along a river that is replenished during the rainy winters that only occur on an irregular schedule. The three-year drought that started in 2015 created a major issue for the water supply as the reservoirs started to deplete, leading to a water apocalypse. Although the city weathered the storm, other water vulnerable cities throughout the world may potentially face similar issues.

In this section, we learn how Cape Town's catastrophic water problem was exacerbated by factors such as a rapidly growing population, inadequate water infrastructure, and tensions between local and national government factions. The city's population more than doubled from 1970 to 2000, yet water storage infrastructure only increased by 17% during the same period. This led to a further factor that exacerbated the water crisis when Cape Town was hit by a drought in 2015. The city's water system relies almost entirely on rainfall, which, coupled with the lack of alternative sources, made Cape Town particularly vulnerable to the crisis.

In this section, we learn about Cape Town's recent water crisis, where severe drought and low rainfall in 2017 left the major South African city with less than five months' worth of water reserves. The city implemented strict water restrictions, which helped to conserve water, but the potential threat of future water shortages remains. With global temperatures predicted to continue rising, more water scarcity issues are likely to arise worldwide, affecting billions of people in water-stressed regions. This highlights the need for cities and countries to invest in water storage and infrastructure to minimize the risk of critical water supply failures. Among the solutions being pushed is a much-debated plan to tap into underground reserves also known as aquifer.
