Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=LXIu9YEr7UM

The relationship between Russia and Iran has evolved into a military alliance due to their shared goals of undermining the American-led world order, unifying the Islamic world, and destroying Israel. Iran has become Russia's main source of resources, providing ammunition, artillery, ballistic missiles, and body armor to the Russian army. The two countries share a common enemy in the United States, with Iran seeking to unite Muslims globally under a single authority, while Russia seeks to expand its borders and control across the former Soviet Bloc. The partnership was solidified through their efforts in Syria, where they support the Bashar al-Assad regime and Hezbollah, and Iran provides a vital transportation route for Russian exports through the International North-South Transport Corridor.

In this section, it is revealed that Iran has become Russia's greatest ally by sending military advisors and soldiers to Ukraine alongside hundreds of manufactured Kamikaze drones, and providing much-needed ammunition, artillery, ballistic missiles, and body armor to the Russian army. Iran has become the main source of resources for the Russians as they find it challenging to replace their losses in tanks, aircraft, artillery, microchips, and other advanced weapon systems that are essential for the effective 21st-century war. The close military cooperation between Iran and Russia marks the birth of a full-blown Russian-Iranian military alliance that could define the 21st century in the region.

In this section, we learn about the long history of tension and conflict between Russia and Iran, with the two nations having fought multiple wars against each other since diplomatic relations were first established centuries ago. Russian expansion into the territories that would later make up modern-day Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, and Dagestan added to the historical tension. However, things changed with the Islamic Revolution in 1979, which brought about the emergence of the ultra-conservative Iranian Shiite Muslim clergy class under Ayatollah Khamenei. The new regime set out to export Iran's Islamic revolution abroad and gradually unify the Islamic world under the rule of Iran's clergy. This new and aggressively ambitious goal brought the new revolutionary Iran into conflict with pretty much every other state in the world.

In this section, the transcript explains the historical context behind Iran becoming Russia's greatest ally. The transcript delves into the history of Iran's Islamic Revolution and how it sent shock waves throughout the Soviet Union, which invaded Afghanistan to prevent the Islamic Revolution from spreading beyond Iran's borders. However, the Soviet Union eventually collapsed, allowing for relations between it and Iran to improve. The relationship between the two countries fully evolved into a full-fledged alliance when civil war broke out in Syria in 2011, and they found themselves engaging in the conflict on the same side by supporting the Bashar al-Assad regime.

In this section, it is discussed how Iran has become a great ally of Russia due to their shared interests in the region regarding their common enemies, such as Israel and the United States. Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon all play important roles in Iran's "axis of resistance" strategy, which is aimed at countering their perceived enemies across the Middle East. Iran and Syria share many commonalities, including their desire to see the destruction of Israel and the rolling back of American influence in the Middle East. As a result, they have found significant common ground with each other, which has led to them being great allies.

In this section, it is explained how Iran has become Russia's greatest ally, supported by their shared goal of unifying Islamic people, expelling Western powers from the Middle East, and destroying Israel. The partnership was solidified through their efforts in Syria, with Iran funneling weapons and supplies through Iraq and into Syria to support Hezbollah, whom they rely on to attack Israel and project power in the Eastern Mediterranean. With Western financial sanctions crippling both nations, Vladimir Putin made his first official state visit outside of the Soviet space to Iran, where trade and cooperation between the two nations continued to increase. Additionally, India's policy of non-alignment and increased purchases of discounted Russian oil, gas, and fertilizer has further boosted Russia's economy, making them the largest supplier of oil and fertilizer to India and the largest supplier of weapons and equipment to the Indian Armed Forces.

In this section, the importance of Iran as a key intermediary between Russia and India in their economic relationship is discussed. Due to the complicated and geopolitically tenuous route for Russia to export to India, Iran is able to assist in the transportation of Russian exports through the International North-South Transport Corridor, which will reduce costs and travel time for Russian exports and enable them to avoid passing through any sensitive maritime choke points. Iran's ability to provide this vital transportation route to export Russian goods is just one of the reasons why Russia is keen to expand its collaboration with Iran, with Russia providing military equipment to Iran and vice versa for various reasons, such as testing equipment and defending their nuclear weapons research facilities.

In this section, it is explained that Russia and Iran are becoming greater allies because both countries share a common goal of undermining the American-led world order. Additionally, Iran wants a nuclear weapon to protect itself from foreign intervention, especially since the US has invaded non-nuclear-armed countries in the past. The normalization of relations between Israel and several Arab nations has left Iran feeling isolated and vulnerable, which is why it made an unprecedented deal with Saudi Arabia under Chinese mediation. Despite their differences, Iran, Russia, and China are united in their belief that the unipolar world order dominated by the United States is coming to an end.

In this section of the transcript, it is explained how Iran and Russia have become close allies due to their shared view of the United States as a common enemy. This is because both Iran and Russia perceive the US as standing in the way of their foreign policy objectives, with Iran seeking to unite Muslims globally under a single authority, while Russia seeks to expand its borders and control across the former Soviet Bloc. This burgeoning military alliance has been particularly evident in Syria, where the conflict has become the epicenter of the Russian-Iranian relationship and their clash with the US.
