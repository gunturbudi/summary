The island of Greenland is melting at an alarming rate, and if it continues to do so, it could result in catastrophic flooding around the world. The island is losing approximately 200 billion metric tons of ice per year to the ocean, and research has shown that this could end up accelerating the global sea levels rise by around 30 centimeters by the end of this Century.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Greenland is a massive island with a small population. The vast majority of the island is uninhabitable due to the cold weather. The island has a huge ice sheet covering most of it. Ice cores drilled out from the sheet by scientists have revealed that the island has been covered in ice for at least the past 18 million years.

The Greenland ice sheet is hiding a wealth of resources, including hydrocarbons, rare earth elements, and minerals. If these resources are ever realized, Greenland could become one of the richest countries in the world. However, the future geography of Greenland is uncertain, as it is unclear how the ice sheet will melt in the future and what will happen to the resources hidden beneath it.

The warming of Greenland and the melting of the ice sheet is changing the geopolitical landscape, as the tiny town of Narsak is now home to vast reserves of rare earth minerals and uranium. This has the potential to make Greenland a major player on the world stage, but there are also concerns about the impact of mining operations on the local environment and way of life.

Greenland is rich in resources like hydrocarbons and rare Earths, but it will take a very long time for Greenland to ever be rich in another major resource food. At the present only 0.002 percent of Greenland's land is actually arable and suitable for agriculture which means that nearly all of the Island's food supply for the 56,000 people who live there today has to be imported from Denmark or from abroad.
