The video discusses the unique status of Washington DC, which is a federal district under the direct control of the United States Congress. This fact leads to a lot of strange consequences for all the citizens of the United States, including the stateless residents of Washington DC. There is a fierce fight going on right now within DC to finally gain their voice and representation in Congress through becoming America's newest and 51st state.

The video discusses the history of DC and its lack of representation in Congress. In 1846, Congress agreed to return DC to the residents of Virginia. In 1961, the 23rd Amendment to the US Constitution granted DC residents the ability to vote for the president. In 1973, the District of Columbia Home Rule Act allowed DC residents to elect their own city council and mayor.

The video discusses the history of the District of Columbia, which has been in a state of limbo since 1978. The proposed amendment that would have granted D.C full representation in Congress failed in 1993, but a new movement to allow D.C to become a state began in 1982. In 1993, a bill to allow D.C to become a state was voted on in Congress, but it failed by a wide margin. The majority of the votes were from Democrats, but Republicans opposed the amendment because it would have made Washington, D.C., a very solidly Democratic state.

The video discusses how Democrats and Republicans across America have historically been very partisan in their support or opposition of DC statehood, with no progress ever being made on the issue. However, in 2016, a new statehood proposal began gaining momentum, and if successful, it would transform the majority of the current District into the new state of Washington D.C. Meanwhile, the federal enclave that currently covers just the National Mall, the White House, Capitol building, and the principal Federal buildings would become America's first city-state.
