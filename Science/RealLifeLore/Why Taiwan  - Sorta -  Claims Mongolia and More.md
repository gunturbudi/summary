The video discusses the complicated history of Taiwan and its relationship with Mongolia. The commentary argues that Taiwan "sorta" claims Mongolia because the PRC does not officially recognize the PRC as a legitimate government, meaning that any subsequent attempt at incorporating Taiwan into the PRC would have far-reaching diplomatic consequences. However, Taiwan has done some things in recent years to at least somewhat recognize Mongolia's independence.

This video discusses why Taiwan "sorta" claims Mongolia, and how this issue has been complicated by China's history. Taiwan's government officially refers to itself as the Republic of China, which dates back to 1911 when the Qing dynasty was overthrown. In the 1920s, Mongolia fought a war against the Bolsheviks, who had recently emerged as a major power in Russia. This led to Mongolia's independence being recognized by the Republic of China. However, Taiwan has never recognized Mongolia's independence, and has instead claimed all of Mongolia's territory as its own. This has led to ongoing border disputes with 17 other countries, many of which are located across Asia.

In 1949, the Chinese communists declared the People's Republic of China on the mainland, after defeating the nationalist government of the Republic of China (ROC) in a civil war. The ROC continued to claim Mongolia as part of the realm of China, while the PRC recognized the independence of both Mongolia and Tibet. The PRC absorbed Tibet in 1959, and has since maintained some border disputes with other countries. The ROC revoked its recognition of Mongolia in 1953 and has been a permanent member of the UN Security Council since 1971.
