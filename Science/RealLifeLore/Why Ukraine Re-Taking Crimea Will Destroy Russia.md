# Summary of Why Ukraine Re-Taking Crimea Will Destroy Russia

Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=MFYDYSYapz4

The video explains that Ukraine re-taking Crimea would be a difficult task due to the peninsula's geography, which favors defenders, and Russia's control of the region's beaches and headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet. However, severing Russia's land bridge through occupied Ukrainian territory could greatly increase the difficulty of supplying Crimea, making the situation unsustainable for Russia in the long term. Yet, retaking Crimea via military action could result in significant casualties and a risk of escalation, and deporting the pro-Russian population could lead to massive hardship and become a propaganda defeat for Ukraine. Therefore, the video suggests that making Russia fear losing Crimea may be the wiser solution, and proposes three potential solutions, including Russia surrendering all occupied territories in Ukraine except for Crimea, Ukraine retaking Crimea, and Crimea becoming an independent and demilitarized country.

Detail Summary:

In this section, the complexities of re-taking Crimea by Ukraine are discussed. The Ukrainian government's ultimate goal is to reclaim all occupied lands, including Crimea, but this objective would be the most challenging, dangerous, and bloody task to achieve. Crimea's geography inherently favors defenders, with only the narrow Isthmus of Peracop acting as a bottleneck for armies advancing into the peninsula. The Savage, a large shallow lagoon to the northeast, provides a window of opportunity for attacking units to advance across and flank the defenses at the rear of the Isthmus, but this strategy carries a heavy risk as the tide will inevitably come back and sever the supply line to the mainland until the next low tide.

In this section, the video explains why Ukraine retaking Crimea would be nearly impossible due to the geographic advantages of the peninsula. Crimea's beaches and the headquarters of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Sebastopol are difficult to attack, and Ukraine does not have the necessary equipment to establish air and naval superiority. The only other options involve attacking across the Isthmus of pericop, a narrow strip of land connecting Crimea to Ukraine, or through the swampy Savage. However, these methods have resulted in catastrophic casualties in previous assaults, and the defenders have always had a significant advantage. Ukraine would need to possess either naval or air supremacy or a significantly larger number of troops and equipment to overcome the geography and historical precedent.

In this section, it is discussed how re-taking Crimea by Ukraine would be a major challenge that would require a large number of troops and result in significant casualties. The geography of the region makes it difficult for the Ukrainian army to attack directly, and they will have to rely on attacking through Zaparizia and Don yet's provinces to reach the coastline of the Sea of assav. The key objective is to sever one of the primary supply arteries that the Russians are using to keep a hold over their position in Crimea, the land bridge from the Russian Mainland to Crimea through occupied Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainians have been pleading with the West to send them tanks and armored personnel carriers, which they will need to launch an offensive. However, even with the right equipment, there's no guarantee of victory. The Russians are preparing for an attack and have been digging in and concentrating new, freshly recruited conscripts in the area to resist. If the Ukrainians fail to sever the land bridge during this offensive, they stand to permanently lose the southern chunk of their country, but if they succeed in cutting off Crimea from Russia, they could initiate a blockade that would work more in their favor and against the Russians.

In this section, it is explained how Ukraine could potentially sever Russia's land bridge in the north and turn Crimea back into an island, which would greatly increase the difficulty of supplying Crimea with essential resources. The north Crimean Canal, which supplies 85 percent of Crimea's water, was shut down by Ukraine after the annexation, causing widespread water shortages and a crash in agriculture. The construction of the Kurt straight Bridge in 2018 helped alleviate some of these issues, but if the land bridge is severed, supply routes will become limited again, making the situation unsustainable for Russia in the long term. Losing Crimea would be a significant blow to Russia's national security as well as Putin's personal political power, since the port of Sevastopol is a vital strategic location for projecting power in the Black Sea and beyond.

In this section, we learn why Crimea is so valuable to Moscow and the potential risks involved if Ukraine tries to take it back. Losing control over Sevastopol would doom Russia's Black Sea Fleet, leaving Mermansk as its only good harbor. If Crimea falls into Ukraine's hands, Putin would have wasted hundreds of thousands of lives and untold amounts of treasure trying to cling onto it, which would permanently tarnish Russia's ability to influence world defense. It is of higher core strategic value to Moscow than it is to Washington or Brussels. There is a risk, no matter how small, that Moscow may decide that it is worth the risk of escalation to deploy a weapon of mass destruction to prevent losing the peninsula. Crimea's demographics also make it unique, as the area is a majority ethnic Russian and probably a very pro-Russian territory.

00:25:00
In this section, it is discussed that the demographic situation in Crimea has shifted heavily towards Russia's favor over the past nine years since the annexation, with pro-Ukrainian residents leaving or being expelled and Russian citizens encouraged to migrate to the peninsula. If Ukrainian troops were to retake Crimea, they might face partisan resistance and insurgency from the Russian population that had moved there. The question of what to do with the Russians who moved there since 2014 arises, and it seems unlikely that they will receive amnesty if they collaborated with Russia. The only way to revert the situation back to 2014 would be to forcefully deport hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people, leading to massive hardship and suffering and becoming a propaganda defeat for Ukraine. Thus, the article suggests that it may be more prudent and wiser for Ukraine to make Russia fear losing Crimea than to try and take it back by force.

In this section, the video presents three potential solutions for the situation regarding Crimea. The first is that Russia surrenders all of its occupied territories in Ukraine, except for Crimea, which poses a security risk for Ukraine. The second is that Ukraine retakes Crimea via military action, which would likely result in the destruction of Russia due to their nuclear weapons. The third solution is that Russia surrenders all occupied land in Ukraine and Crimea becomes an independent and demilitarized country, separate from both Moscow and Kiev. This would be possible with U.N peacekeepers deployed to the peninsula and Ukraine agreeing to keep the water flowing through the Crimean canal. This section concludes by acknowledging that wars occur due to a failure of diplomacy and a clash of core interests that cannot be reconciled. Despite having objectives, the futures of Crimea and its inhabitants remain uncertain.
