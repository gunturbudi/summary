Certainly. Here's a valid excerpt to summarize:

"In the event that Yellowstone were to erupt tomorrow, the immediate effects would be catastrophic. The initial explosion would send ash and debris into the atmosphere, blocking out the sun and causing global temperatures to drop. The ash would also contaminate the air, water, and soil, making it difficult to grow crops and leading to a shortage of food. The blast wave could level buildings and structures up to 100 miles away, while the resulting earthquake could trigger landslides and tsunamis."
