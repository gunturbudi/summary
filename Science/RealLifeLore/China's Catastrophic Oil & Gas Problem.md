China is heavily reliant on importing energy from abroad, primarily from Iran and the Arab states, through the Strait of Malacca. If the strait were to become blocked or obstruction, China's economy would collapse.

China has become the world's largest consumer of energy, relying heavily on imported oil and gas. As China's economy grows, its demand for energy continues to increase, meaning that China relies heavily on imports. In 2021, China will surpass Japan to become the world's largest importer of oil. China's reliance on imported oil puts it at risk of being blockaded by the United States.

The video discusses China's oil and gas crisis, which the presenter believes is eerily similar to the US situation in 1941. The crisis could lead to a military conflict between China and the US, with other members of the Indo-Pacific Quad coalition also involved.

China has been investing aggressively into naval and air bases built out of nothing across the tiny coral atolls within the south China sea itself, giving their ships and planes proximity to both the malacca and taiwan straits. This has led to Beijing's aggressive territorial claims in the south China sea.

Another way Beijing is attempting to overcome their malacca dilemma is by attempting to revive the ancient silk road of the past for Beijing's energy transportation and export needs in the present. They call it the belt and road Initiative, or bri. This has resulted in China investing 1.4 trillion dollars, more than seven times the amount invested in America's Marshall Plan during the Second World War.

The video discusses China's oil and gas problems, which include a lack of access to domestic resources and reliance on foreign imports. The narrator explains that both Russia and China are investing heavily in liquefied natural gas (LNG), and that this relationship is the reason why China and Russia are friendly with each other. In February, just weeks before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, both countries announced that their friendship had no limits. China is seeking new, more eager customers for its energy, and is unwilling to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The pipelines discussed in the video include a pipeline from Myanmar to Kunming, a pipeline from Pakistan to Kashgar, and a pipeline from India to Gwadar.

The video discusses China's oil and gas crisis, and highlights the logistical difficulties and geographic constraints of building a pipeline through the mountainous regions of China. The construction of a highway to transport fuel and exports between mainland China and the Chinese-invested port of Wadar has helped solve this issue, but the Chinese are increasingly worried about the security of their holdings in Central Asia. The Chinese regime has begun a genocide against the Uyghur people, a minority ethnic group living in Xinjiang, in order to secure Xinjiang within Beijing's orbit.
