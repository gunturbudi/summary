The YouTube video "Why Visiting This Lost Island Will Kill You" discusses the dangers of visiting North Sentinel Island. The island is home to the Sentinelese, a small hunter-gatherer tribe that has managed to remain isolated and uncontacted from the outside world for tens of thousands of years. The Sentinelese are hostile to any outsiders who visit the island, and there have been numerous instances of visitors being killed by the tribe. The Indian government has given full legal immunity to whatever actions the Sentinelese take on the island, including killings of any outsider who visits. Consequently, visiting the island is not worth the risk, and those who do so should stay alive.

John Allen Chao, a 26-year-old American, arrived in Port Blair, the capital of the remote Andaman Islands, in October of 2018 in an attempt to spread Christianity to the Sentinelese tribe. He contracted an unknown disease and died, resulting in widespread news coverage. The Sentinelese are a small hunter-gatherer tribe that have managed to remain isolated and uncontacted from the outside world for tens of thousands of years.

The video discusses how the British colonization of the Andaman Islands resulted in the deaths of many indigenous peoples, including the sentinelese. It goes on to say that the return of World War II led to the Japanese invasion of the islands, and that the sentinelese have remained hostile towards any other visitors since then.

This lost island will kill you, as the Japanese committed atrocities during World War II, including 10% of the pre-war population of Port Blair dying beneath their occupation. The Andaman Islands were granted to India as part of its independence, but the Sentinelese, a tribe of indigenous people who speak a language only known to them, are too hostile to allow anybody close enough to gain any linguistic clues from them. The Indian Anthropologist, trilognath Pandit, began visiting the island in 1967 in an attempt to gain the trust of the Sentinelese, but the project failed. In 1975, he led the king of Belgium on an overnight cruise just offshore the island, but other visitors from the outside world occasionally found themselves washing up on the island's beaches. In 1977, a cargo ship registered in Panama, the MV Primrose, ran aground on one of the island's Coastal reefs and the crew became Shipwrecked. They had to wait patiently for another ship to arrive and rescue them. In 1978, a Japanese cargo ship, the MV Yakumo Maru, ran aground on the same reef, and the crew became stranded. The American Helicopter pilots who happened to be working in the area nearby were contacted and airlifted around 30 of

The YouTube video "Why Visiting This Lost Island Will Kill You" warns that visiting North Sentinel Island will kill you due to the dangerous interactions between the Sentinelese and outsiders. In 1988, Pandit observed a sentinelese man dancing after receiving a coconut gift from a visiting anthropologist. In 1991, the first known contact between the Sentinelese and outsiders took place, and from that point forward, there have been numerous visits by outsiders to the island, but every one has ended in death. In 2006, two Indian fishermen illegally fishing in the Sentinelese territory were hacked to death. In 2018, a Christian missionary visiting the island was killed by the Sentinelese. The Indian government has given full legal immunity to whatever actions the Sentinelese take on the island, including killings of any outsider who visits. Consequently, visiting the island is not worth the risk, and those who do so should stay alive.
