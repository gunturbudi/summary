# Summary of Why Turkey is Transforming Istanbul Into an Island

Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=F6I7eHVXh2A

Turkey plans to transform Istanbul into an island to gain more control over the critical Bosphorus Strait, which connects the Black Sea to the Mediterranean and separates Europe and Asia. The country intends to build a new canal to relieve pressure on the existing Bosphorus, subvert the 1936 Montreux Convention, and bypass restrictions on the kinds of ships that can traverse the strait. Although Turkey argues that the new canal will only relieve congestion and create more real estate opportunities, critics argue that the canal will displace thousands of residents and cause environmental damage. The proposed plans have also faced significant opposition from Russia and other international powers.

In this section, the video discusses the importance of the Bosphorus strait, which separates Europe and Asia and connects the Black Sea to the Mediterranean. The strait is critical to many countries for international trade, especially Russia as it is the only way for them to ship oil out to the world's oceans. However, Turkey benefits very little from this possession as they make zero dollars from it and can't allow certain allied warships through. To fix this, Turkey plans to transform Istanbul into an island to gain more control over the Bosphorus and its traffic. The video also delves into the history of treaties and conventions that have impacted Turkey's control over the strait.

In this section, it is discussed that Turkey is planning to build an artificial canal adjacent to the natural Bosphorus strait, transforming Istanbul into an island. This would effectively subvert the 1936 Montreux Convention, which restricts the ability of the US and other non-Black Sea nations to send significant large ships, like aircraft carriers and submarines, through the Bosphorus. While Turkey argues that the restrictive terms of the Montreal Convention only apply to the Bosphorus strait, they are planning to bypass the congested shipping lanes, and alleviate ferrying dangers to Istanbul City Center. The new Istanbul Canal Mega-Project would, therefore, permit Turkey to begin charging tolls, and allow US/NATO access to the Black Sea via artificial canal.

In this section, it's explained that Turkey wants to develop a new canal that would relieve the congestion in the Bosphorus strait and open up more real estate. Critics believe that the canal won't be able to attract enough ships to divert them from the Bosphorus, and it will cause displacement of thousands of residents and environmental damage. Additionally, some of the property along the canal's planned route is already owned by members of the Qatari royal family and the Turkish minister of finance, who is the son-in-law of President Erdogan himself, meaning that he would personally benefit from the canal's resulting real estate development. Furthermore, the idea of the new canal is heavily opposed by many outside powers, especially Russia, as Turkey argues the Montreal Convention will not apply to it, which could theoretically enable massive US ships, aircraft carriers, and submarines into the Black Sea for the very first time.

In this section, we learn about the importance of the Bosporus Strait and its potential disruption. The Bosporus Strait is a vital route for several industries and resources, especially wheat, as Russia and Ukraine are the world's largest and fifth-largest wheat exporters and together, they export more wheat than all of North America combined. Disruption in the Bosporus could lead to catastrophic consequences like the 2010 once-in-a-century drought event that hit Russia and Ukraine, causing Russia to temporarily ban all wheat exports and leading to widespread food shortages that contributed to the Arab Spring event that year. But President Erdogan and the Turkish government are committed to completing the Istanbul canal by 2023, a move that would change Istanbul's geography and strain relations between Russia and Turkey, jeopardize Russia's monopoly of power in the Black Sea and open Turkey to future conflict.
