The video discusses the reasons why Russia and China are cooperating, mentioning that each country has strengths and weaknesses that complement each other. China is particularly worried about being encircled by hostile regimes, and Russia provides resources that China needs to fuel its growing economy. The video discusses Russia's vulnerability to China, which is due in part to Russia's small economy and capital base, as well as China's larger size and population. Russia has vast natural resources, but lacks the population and capital to exploit them. China can provide these resources to Russia, and over time reduce its dependence on importing resources. The relationship between China and Russia is an aberration in their history, and is not likely to last forever.

Detail Summary:

The Russian and Chinese leaders declared during a meeting that their partnership is one without limits. The Chinese have never condemned the Russians for any of their actions and they have abstained on every critical vote in the United Nations. The Russian and Chinese relationship has shifted closer into a military alliance in the 2020s, making sense for geopolitics but not for long. The two countries are authoritarian great powers who each want to disrupt and change the status quo in Eurasia. Germany has reunited every former Warsaw Pact country and NATO has expanded to the three former Soviet Baltic republics, Belarus remaining loyal to Moscow. If Ukraine were to join NATO, it would cement NATO's presence across nearly the entirety of the Eurasian step, enabling NATO forces to land unopposed in Crimea. This would place a NATO and American military presence directly along the greater Caucasus Mountains, around which are flatter Coastal strips that can be utilized by an invading army into the Eurasian step across from these mountains and through the low easy to pass through Coastal entrances. This situation would understandably make Moscow nervous, leading to the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008.

The video discusses the reasons why Russia and China are cooperating, mentioning that each country has strengths and weaknesses that complement each other. China is particularly worried about being encircled by hostile regimes, and Russia provides resources that China needs to fuel its growing economy. China also has territorial disputes with several other countries, and its air defense zone in the East China Sea clashes with those of Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. India is also a contested region for both countries.

The video discusses the strategic importance of Russia to Moscow, but also the 1860 treaty that surrendered all of this land to Russia under duress. This has locked the Chinese out from being able to directly access the Sea of Japan, limiting them instead to just the East and South China Seas. This may have an alternate timeline where the Russian Conquest never happened, where the Sea of Japan would have been referred to in Beijing as the North China Sea. Chinese nationalists have never forgotten what happened, and many have labeled the loss of outer Manchuria as another of China's unequal treaties to foreign powers. The relationship between China and the Soviet Union began to deteriorate significantly over their different interpretations of Marxism, and in 1964 Mal privately made comments with a delegation from the Japanese Socialist Party that the Russians had unilaterally absorbed outer Manchuria into their country a century ago. This sparked outrage in Moscow, and four years later in 1968 the Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia in order to put down revolt and published the Brezhnev Doctrine insisting that Moscow reserved the right to topple any other communist government that was strained too far away from the global communist movement. This appeared to indicate an ideological justification for the Soviets to invade China and overthrow Mao, and so he decided to manufacture a crisis along the s

The video discusses Russia's declining influence in Central Asia due to China's growth in the region. The three Central Asian countries that have pulled away from Russia are Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan, all of which have significant hydrocarbon reserves that flow east towards China. China has now become the largest customer of these countries' natural gas supplies, overtaking Russia in trade volumes. The instability in Xinjiang, a province in northwestern China, has reached a boiling point, prompting the Chinese Communist Party to respond with harsh repression. The Chinese people's armed police established a permanent presence just across from their Border in Tajikistan along the tajik side of the Wakan Corridor, a narrow strip of Afghanistan that just reaches out and barely touches China. The objective of this deployment was to stop the spread of Islamist militants and weapons flowing into Xinjiang from Afghanistan and Pakistan. However, Tajikistan was also a member of the CSTO, a military alliance led by Moscow, and the Russians never asked for permission to have a foreign power deploy a military base on their territory. This was a severe affront to the Russians and a sign of their declining influence in Central Asia. China's growing interests in the region are still complicated by Russia's geopolitical control over Central Asia
