# Summary of Why Wyoming is VASTLY Emptier Than Colorado

The video discusses the stark contrast between the populations of Colorado and Wyoming, with Colorado having over 10 times the population despite being only slightly larger in size. Wyoming's low population density of only 2.3 people per square kilometer is highlighted, as well as the lack of major cities in the state. The video explains that Colorado's early discovery of resources and easier access to trading routes via railways allowed for a rapid increase in population, while Wyoming's reliance on agriculture and mining and the ownership of almost half of the land by the federal government made it more difficult to develop. Additionally, Colorado's diversified economy, big-city amenities, and outdoor activities have attracted more people, while Wyoming's inconsistent population growth due to reliance on the fluctuating oil industry has resulted in a small population that values the quiet, peaceful lifestyle of the state.

In this section, the similarities between Colorado and Wyoming are highlighted, including their similar rectangular shape, mountainous terrain, and water resources. However, the drastically different populations of the two states are emphasized, with Colorado having more than 10 times the population of Wyoming despite being only slightly larger in size. Wyoming's population density of just 2.3 people per square kilometer is compared to other empty places on the planet, such as Australia and Namibia, and is noted to be a major anomaly in the United States, as every other state has a significantly higher population. The lack of major cities in Wyoming is also noted, with Cheyenne being the largest town, located in the far southeastern corner of the state and often functioning as a satellite of Colorado's larger cities.

In this section, it is discussed how Colorado's early discovery of resources such as gold, copper, lead, and coal attracted thousands of settlers during the gold rush of 1858 and onward. This resulted in an agriculture boom that skyrocketed Colorado's population to almost 540,000 by the turn of the 20th century, 10 times their 1900 population, while Wyoming's growth stagnated with a population of only 92,000 people in 1900. Colorado's flat land and easier access to trading routes via railways also made it easier to settle compared to Wyoming. In addition, Colorado began diversifying its economy during World War II, attracting federal government offices and administrations in its central and accessible location, unlike Wyoming, which relied solely on agriculture and mining.

In this section, we learn that the main reason why Wyoming is vastly emptier than Colorado has to do with land ownership and development. While Colorado has more land available for private ownership and has attracted more people to move there for better job opportunities in the outdoor recreation lifestyle, Wyoming's development has remained stagnant due to the fact that almost half of its total land area is owned by the federal government. In contrast, Colorado has a more diversified and well-established economy, with strategic industries like mining and aerospace as well as a strong education base and easy access to transportation. These factors have made it much more difficult for Wyoming to compete, leaving it more susceptible to boom and bust cycles and shocks in the global prices for minerals, coal, oil, gas, and agricultural products.

In this section of the video, it is explained that Colorado has had consistent population growth due to its diverse economy, while Wyoming's population has been much more inconsistent due to its reliance on the oil industry, which has fluctuating prices. Colorado offers big-city amenities and outdoor activities while Wyoming can only offer outdoor recreation because of its sparse population. The citizens of Wyoming appreciate the state as it is because it offers a quiet and peaceful lifestyle, and while it may seem negative that Wyoming is the least populated state, the majority of its small population prefers it that way. Skillshare is then promoted as the best way to get started making YouTube videos, with a focus on map animation and other creative fields offered by the platform.

In this section, the video highlights the vast differences in population density between Wyoming and Colorado. While the two states have similar sizes, Wyoming has a much lower population due to a variety of factors, including harsh weather conditions, lack of job opportunities, and limited transportation options. Additionally, Wyoming's economy is largely dependent on mining and agriculture, which attract fewer people than industries such as technology and entertainment. Overall, these factors contribute to Wyoming's reputation as a place of vast open spaces and natural beauty, but few people to enjoy it.
