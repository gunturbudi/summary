# Summary of Why 95% of Australia is Empty

Australia is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world, which is due to several unique factors. Nearly 90% of Australians live within 50 kilometers of the coastline, leaving the vast interior virtually uninhabited. Australian's low population density can be attributed to the existence of large deserts with dangerous animals and insects, as well as geographical challenges, such as cold ocean currents that prevent forming rain clouds in the West, the Great Dividing Range that casts a rain shadow over the vastness of the Australian interior to the West, and the lack of tall mountains to force air upwards to cool into rain. Despite having more renewable fresh water resources than many countries with significantly higher populations, Australia struggles to sustain a large-scale population due to weathering and erosion, scarcity of freshwater, and arable land for agriculture, and its history of low population base and restrictions on non-white immigrants. However, the country is now a proud nation of immigrants and a major agricultural producer, with a sponsor, HelloFresh, showcasing its culinary culture.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
In this section, we learn that despite being an entire continent, Australia is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world. With a population of just over 26 million, the entire country has less people than California and Texas alone. Nearly 90% of Australians live within 50 kilometers of the coastline, leaving most of the vast interior virtually uninhabited. This unique population distribution has created several unusual situations, such as the Shire of East Pilbara in Western Australia and the pastoral unincorporated area in South Australia, which have populations of just over 10,000 and 3,750 respectively, and are larger than entire countries like Japan and France. The largest cattle farm in the world, Anna Creek Station, which is larger than Israel, is occupied by only about a dozen people and 10,000 cows.

In this section, the reasons for Australia's low population density are explained. While the existence of a large desert with dangerous animals and insects is a contributing factor, it is not the only one. Australia is geographically challenged with cold ocean currents coming from Antarctica preventing large-scale evaporation necessary for forming rain clouds in the West. The Great Dividing Range runs down the entire Eastern side of the continent, and its height prevents rain clouds from advancing further than the immediate band of land between the mountains and the coastline. These mountains cast a rain shadow over the vastness of the Australian interior to the West. Additionally, Australia has very few tall mountains to force air upwards to cool into rain, while the air is too hot for rain to form, and the tropical and subtropical high-pressure belt serves to both warm and dry out the air around it. An increase in drought-like conditions exaggerates the dry and desert-like conditions over 35% of the continent.

In this section, the video explains that while most of the rain in Australia falls on the east coast, the northern part of the continent suffers from highly erratic rainfall. Northern Australia's monsoons and tropical cyclones occur during a limited period, leading to most of the rain falling in just four months. Furthermore, the lack of decently large rivers makes freshwater a scarcity, even in the highly populated cores like the Murray Darling Basin in the southeast. Climate change and higher temperatures have further worsened the scarcity of freshwater. It is also difficult to sustain a massive population with good lands for farming and agriculture in northern Australia due to continuous weathering and erosion that began one and a half billion years ago.

In this section, the video explains that Australia has a lot of fresh water resources, estimated at 492 cubic kilometers worth of renewable fresh water resources, more than many countries with significantly higher populations. Additionally, while only about 6% of Australia's land is arable and suitable for agriculture, Australia has more arable land than Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos combined, despite having a much smaller population than those countries. This suggests that Australia has the potential to support a lot more people than the current population of 26 million if it were able to utilize its resources. However, because of its difficult geography and isolation, Australia has been left largely untouched by humans for almost its entire history.

In this section, the video explains that the Dutch never established a permanent settlement in Australia as they found the areas too uninhabitable. The first permanent European settlement in Australia was established by British colonizers in 1788 in modern-day Sydney. At that time, the Aboriginal population of the continent was likely only around 650,000, while every other inhabited continent on the planet had vastly more people than Australia. Australia began the modern era of industrialization from a far lower population base than any other inhabited continent and struggled to attract immigrants from Europe. Additionally, the racist white Australian policy restricted immigration to people of white European ancestry and gave preference to those from Britain. The flow of immigrants to the continent remained a trickle of people for decades, while millions of immigrants were arriving in the United States every couple of years.

In this section, we learn about Australia's immigration history. Before 1945, the country only accepted immigrants from Great Britain or Ireland, and even afterward, non-whites were excluded from migrating. However, by the 1960s, Australia began to encourage immigrants from all over the European continent, and over three million Western Europeans moved to the country. It wasn't until 1973 that the white Australia policy was overturned, and race ceased being a factor in the immigration policy, allowing for large-scale, multiethnic immigration. Now, Australia is a proud nation of immigrants, with around one in three people on the continent being born outside of it, the highest proportion of immigrants in any developed Western nation. While Australia welcomes immigration as a way to increase its population, it faces challenges such as a difficult climate, but it remains a major agricultural producer of sheep, beef, almonds, and lentils.

The end of the video features a sponsorship by Hella Fresh, a meal delivery kit service that allows individuals to prepare quick, home-cooked meals, such as pecan crusted chicken within 30 minutes. The host highly recommends trying the service out, due to the convenience and deliciousness of the meals, and offers a promo code to try out the service for up to 16 free meals and three additional surprise gifts.
