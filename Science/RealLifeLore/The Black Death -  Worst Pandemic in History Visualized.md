"The Black Death: Worst Pandemic in History Visualized" is a YouTube video that discusses the origins and spread of the bubonic plague, which killed an estimated 60% of the European population between 1347 and 1351. The disease is spread by infected fleas on rats that stow away on ships and jump to humans. The trade routes of the Byzantine Empire helped to spread the disease to eventually kill around 50 million people, or 13% of the global population. The video also promotes Curiosity Stream and Nebula, which offer short documentaries on the coronavirus pandemic and other educational content.

In this section, the video discusses the origins and spread of the bubonic plague, which has arguably had the biggest impact on human history of any disease. The bacteria responsible for bubonic plague, Yersinia pestis, lay relatively dormant for thousands of years until a pandemic erupted in Egypt in the 6th century AD. The disease is spread by infected fleas on rats that stow away on ships and jump to humans. The trade routes of the Byzantine Empire helped to spread the disease, which went on to kill around 50 million people, or 13% of the global population, and led to the demise of the Roman Empire, making way for new empires to rise up. The bubonic plague quieted down for several hundred years before re-emerging in 1347 in a trading outpost in Crimea, where it killed 80% of the population.

In this section, we learn about the devastating impact of the bubonic plague, known as the Black Death, which killed an estimated 60% of the European population between 1347 to 1351. The plague ravaged most of the European continent, and areas in the Mediterranean, like Italy, France, and Spain, saw up to 75% of their populations dying. The Middle East lost approximately one out of every three people. The plague is believed to have killed as many as 200 million people across Eurasia in just five years. This led to the destruction of serfdom and feudalism in Europe, making way for the rise of capitalism. It took Europe two centuries to recover to its previous population level, and periodic flare-ups in various places across Europe continued for centuries.

In this section, the video promotes Curiosity Stream and its multiple short documentaries, such as those that can teach viewers about the ongoing and evolving coronavirus pandemic, how it began in Wuhan, how it spread, and how scientists worldwide are racing to find a vaccine. The video also features Nebula, a streaming video platform created by educational creators, including Real Life Lore. To access both platforms, users can sign up for the Curiosity Stream Nebula bundle deal, which is just $20 for an entire year.
