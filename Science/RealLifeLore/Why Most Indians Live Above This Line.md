In the near future, India will surpass China as the world's most populous nation. India's population growth has been primarily concentrated in the north of the country, due to the large mountain ranges and influence of weather patterns.

The video discusses the reasons why the Indian Plate is crashing into the Eurasian Plate, why the Towering Himalayas create a barrier between the north and south, and how this affects the land and population of India. The article mentions that the Indus and Brahmaputra rivers, which flow through the plains of northern India, are all fed by the glaciers up in the Himalayas. This explains why the area has a high level of agricultural productivity. The southern portions of India, below the population line, don't have the same advantages.

The video explains how the mountains across India (west and east) impact rainfall and agriculture. The Western Goths (mountains) are higher than the Himalayas, but they don't block wind and rain from the Bay of Bengal. This lack of precipitation makes agriculture difficult in the south of India.
