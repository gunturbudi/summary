# Summary of Why 80% of New Zealand is Empty

Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=F_g6-4swJ_s

The majority of New Zealand's land area is uninhabitable, with only 18 people per square kilometer, a population density 15 times less than the UK's. Most of the population, over 75%, lives in the North Island clustered around Auckland, while the South Island has a population density of only 5.4 people per square kilometer. The Southern Alps mountains dominate the South Island, causing a rain shadow that makes the plains arid, less able to support agriculture, and hindered civilization. The North Island has more flat land available, receives more evenly distributed rainfall, and has warmer temperatures that make it ideal for agriculture. New Zealand's geographic location, distance from global consumer markets, and limited ability to grow crops forced the country to become an offshore European Ranch that now exports animal resources, with animal agriculture taking over half of available land. The average house price in Auckland is now over $1.1 million USD, and the country's quotas on the number of people allowed in each year are rooted in scientific thinking.

Detail Summary:

In this section, the video discusses the fact that nearly 80% of New Zealand’s land area is completely uninhabited by humans, despite having a larger size and similar climate to many densely populated areas in the world. In particular, the population density in New Zealand is only 18 people per square kilometer, while the UK, for example, is 15 times as densely populated. The majority of New Zealand’s population, over three-quarters of them, live clustered together on the North Island, primarily around the city of Auckland. Even the South Island, which used to have more people in the 19th and early 20th centuries, now has a population density of only 5.4 people per square kilometer on average, making it almost barren. The video attributes this relative emptiness to New Zealand’s sheer isolation, with the closest large landmass being nearly 2,000 kilometers away across the open ocean.

In this section, we learn about the history of New Zealand, which remained an isolated and untouched ecosystem until Polynesian explorers discovered it in the 13th century. Over time, a unique culture developed, and the population grew to around 200,000 by the time of British contact in 1769. However, after the British Empire formally incorporated New Zealand into its possessions, a flood of British and Irish immigrants replaced the Maori as the dominant culture. Most early European settlers chose to live on the South Island, but its mountainous terrain made it significantly more difficult to build civilization compared to the more populated North Island, where over three-quarters of the population now lives. The Southern Alps mountain range dominates and offers a challenging task for economic development due to the cost and labor-intensive process of building around or through them.

In this section, it is explained why 80% of New Zealand is empty. The Southern Alps, present in the South Island, have caused a rain shadow across the plains of the island's eastern side, with less rainfall turning them arid. This led to less flat land available for development, with drought-like conditions, making it difficult to grow crops. In contrast, the North Island is less mountainous than the South Island and has more flat land available for development. It also receives more evenly distributed rainfall and has warmer temperatures, making it ideal for conducting agriculture and supporting people. New Zealand's mostly temperate climate, easily available water in some locations, and abundant grasses make it perfect for grazing and ranching, and they built their entire agricultural industry off of animals instead. While only 2% of New Zealand's land is considered arable, 55% is still being used for agriculture, predominantly for raising animals.

In this section, we learn that New Zealand's geographical location, distance from global consumer markets, and limited ability to grow crops, forced the country to become an offshore European Ranch. New Zealand's primary exports are animal resources, like sheep and cows, which the country has been producing competitively for almost 200 years. This animal agriculture industry takes up over half of New Zealand's total available land, limiting the ability for people to spread out and settle even further across the islands. Although birth rates in New Zealand have dropped beneath the replacement level, the country's long history of immigration has kept the population growing. Recent years have seen an increase in immigration, primarily from China, India, and the Philippines, with most immigrants settling in Auckland, the largest city with the best flight connections to their original countries.

In this section, the video explains that despite most of New Zealand being empty, much of it is not inhabitable for various reasons, including natural limitations. Auckland is a city that has experienced significant population growth and its residents are concerned about the sustainability of its growth rate. The average house price in Auckland has increased to over $1.1 million USD, while the average annual salary remains at $44,000 USD, making it one of the least affordable cities in the world to own a home. Additionally, the country's quotas on the number of people allowed in each year are rooted in logical and scientific thinking, as they understand the limitations of their islands.
