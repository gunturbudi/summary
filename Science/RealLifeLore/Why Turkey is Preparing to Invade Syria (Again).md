Turkey is preparing to invade Syria in order to establish a "safe zone" between itself and the Kurdish rebels. This has created tensions with the United States and other NATO members, who view the Kurdish forces as allies. If successful, this would be a significant blow to the Kurds, who are currently fighting the Syrian government and ISIS.

Detail Summary:

Turkey is preparing to invade Syria again, due to the ongoing Kurdish separatist conflict and the potential for Kurdish statehood. This has the potential to cause a cascading domino effect, uniting all of the Kurdish regions into a single state.

Turkey has been fighting a brutal campaign against the PKK for decades, and is now preparing to invade Syria again in order to stamp out Kurdish separatism. This has created tensions with the United States and other NATO members, who view the Kurdish forces in Syria and Iraq as allies. The video also mentions the economic crisis in Turkey and the increasing anti-refugee sentiment among Turkish nationalists. If and when Turkey establishes a 30 kilometer deep "safe zone" across Northern Syria, it will effectively create a buffer between itself and the Kurdish rebels and regime forces in Syria. This would be a significant blow to the Kurds, who are currently fighting the Syrian government and ISIS.

The Turkish government is preparing to invade Syria again in order to establish a 30 kilometer wide safe zone that will ease societal pressures and anti-refugee sentiment within Turkey. This will weaken the Kurdish population's demographic hold in the area across the border from the Kurdish majority areas in Turkey. The establishment of the so-called safe zone will also strengthen Turkey's grip in Syria and ensure them a seat to the negotiating table for whenever the Syrian Civil War finally comes to a conclusion. President Erdogan has used the Turkish military to invade and intervene in Syria multiple times in the recent past, all of which have been geared towards achieving this greater goal. However, the United States' primary interest in the Syrian Civil War has always been countering the rise of Isis, and this has shocked the world in 2014 when Isis suddenly seized control over nearly a third of Syria in a blitzkrieg-style offensive. The United States then began a targeted bombing campaign of Isis targets from the air while they began to heavily Supply the Kurdish factions in the SDF with weapons and advisors to simultaneously fight against Isis on the ground. The strategy largely worked out and Isis began to crumble and lost most of their ground by 2017. However, the United States was unprepared for how badly this strategy was going to blow

The video discusses how, due to economic sanctions and strained relations with their NATO ally, Turkey is preparing to invade Syria again. Turkey is aware of the geopolitical calculus involved, and is hoping to seize territory in Northern Syria before another big player, Russia, can do so. However, one thorny issue is the presence of Syrian rebels, opposed to the Assad regime, who are confined to a small part of Syria. If the Assad regime were to take over these rebels, it would lead to a refugee crisis for Turkey.

Turkey is preparing to invade Syria again in order to expand its zone of control, which began in 2009 when it unilaterally claimed maritime boundaries that cut into the UN-recognized borders of Greece and Egypt. Turkey's increasingly aggressive foreign policy extends well beyond Syria, and all began with a natural gas discovery that changed Turkey's foreign policy and destiny forever.
