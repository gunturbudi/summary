Finland's recent decision to join NATO has put Russia in a difficult position, as Finland shares a long border with Russia and has a well-equipped and motivated army. This move will make it much more difficult for Russia to mount a military campaign against the three Baltic states, and is a major strategic defeat for Russia.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Finland shares a long border with Russia, which makes it an easy target for Russia. Finland has always been small in numbers, so the Russians have never been able to capitalize on their geographical advantages over Finland. In response, the Russians have been fearful of Finland joining a hostile military alliance. However, in April 2014, Finland announced that it would be joining NATO, which will cost the Russians dearly. This decision will checkmate Russia's ambitions in the north.

The video discusses why Finland joined NATO in the early 1950s, as the Soviet Union was increasingly fearful of Finland joining a military alliance with a hostile foreign power. The invasion of Finland by the Soviet Union in 1941 was a disaster for the Soviets, with Finnish troops taking more casualties than the Finns. Despite the Soviet Union's victory, Finland was forced into signing a peace treaty in 1944 that essentially confirmed the status quo of the older treaty. Finland maintained its independence throughout the Cold War by maintaining its military neutrality and avoiding membership in NATO. In 1995, Finland joined the European Union. Today, three-fourths of Finnish men complete their mandatory military service, and in the event of war with Russia, Finland can rapidly mobilize its military.

The video discusses the reasons why Finland decided to join NATO, and how this will benefit the country. Finland's army is well-equipped and motivated, and its military and society have been designed to deter another Russian invasion. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, Finland decided to apply for NATO membership. The increased geopolitical tensions between NATO and Russia since then have made Finland more prepared for a potential invasion.

The 1-paragraph summary discusses how Finland joining NATO would dramatically improve the security of the three Baltic states, making it much more difficult for Russia to mount a military campaign against them. This would also be a major strategic defeat for Russia, as their nuclear arsenal is based in the northern part of the Cola Peninsula, which is right next to Finland.

The video discusses Finland's decision to join NATO, which could potentially checkmate Russia's submarines. Finland still does not want to unnecessarily provoke the Russians, so approval by all 30 other members of NATO is required before full membership can be granted. This process is expected to be completed by April 2023.
