Mexico City is a problematic place to live due to its sinking land and pollution problems. The video discusses how the city has grown rapidly over the past century, putting strain on its resources.

Detail Summary:

Mexico City is sinking due to heavy human and geological activity, with parts of the city sinking an estimated 30 meters below ground by the end of the 21st century. This is a problem because the city is already densely populated and many of the city's inhabitants will be forced to move.

Mexico City is a geographically problematic place, but evidently they thought that eh, they just decided to stay and drain the lake even more and even more instead under the Aztecs Tenochtitlan's population was around 400,000 at its peak and was basically just a small but very dense dot within Lake Texaco. By 1900, the population here was actually pretty much the same but the 20th century would see the city's population absolutely skyrocket by 1950, to cover 30 square miles and be home to over 3 million people. Today, Mexico City has grown from there to cover an area of approximately 3,000 square miles and with nearly 22 million people this enormous development in just a hundred years has effectively wiped out any trace of the former waters of Lake Texaco. The city struggles perpetually to provide enough water for her citizens without the waters of Lake Texaco, and has been forced to drill deeper and deeper into the below-ground aquifers in her ever-desperate quest for water. The problem here is that the land beneath Mexico City is an ancient soft clay lake bed, and as Mexico City drills for more and more water, the clay weakens and crumbles, the water pressure within the aquifer supports the soil above it, which in turn
