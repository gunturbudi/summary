Satellite photos have been used to document the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Many images show troop movements and military equipment buildup, all of which raised suspicion that an invasion was imminent. The photos also show damage to airports and highways near the border. Despite capturing the airport, the Russians were unable to use it for troop movement, and instead started using convoys of trucks to cross into Ukraine. The photos show the extent of the damage caused by the invasion, as well as the difficulty of defending against it.
