The video discusses how Mexico's geography has made it difficult for the country to develop, and how this has been compounded by the oil shale gas revolution in the United States. The video also explains how Brilliant has a course designed to help people learn math and science interactively.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
In Mexico, the population is concentrated in a narrow strip along the center of the country, which is only 18 percent of the country's total land area. This strip corresponds to the temperate climate band found in the center of Mexico, which is one of the most difficult biomes to develop a civilization within. Over the past 130 years, the American population has expanded four times, while the population in Mexico has expanded 10 times. The pattern of where Mexicans live geographically has remained more or less consistent throughout history.

Mexico is largely empty due to its mountainous landscape and difficult climate for agriculture. This is compounded by the fact that 70% of the country is covered by mountains. This makes it difficult to build infrastructure and transport links, and makes it difficult to develop agriculture.

The video explains how Mexico's high elevations and fertile volcanoes make it an ideal place to grow crops. However, because of the Spaniards' conquest, Mexico City has since become one of the world's largest and most populous cities. The high elevation also makes it difficult to travel between the different valleys in the country.

Mexico is a very mountainous country, and it has been difficult to build out infrastructure links between the capital and its different valley areas. This makes it difficult for Mexico to generate a surplus of capital, and it has also historically kept Mexican power contained.

Mexico's geography makes it difficult for the government to effectively police and patrol its borders, which has resulted in a number of autonomous warlord-style factions operating with impunity. In addition, Mexico's proximity to the United States makes it an advantageous location for factories to export products duty-free. NAFTA has further enabled this process. Cities along Mexico's northern border have significantly higher populations than their American counterparts, due to institutional and geographic reasons.

The video discusses the consequences of the oil shale gas revolution in the United States on Mexico, which has led to an abundance of cheap natural gas and a surge in Mexican manufacturing.
