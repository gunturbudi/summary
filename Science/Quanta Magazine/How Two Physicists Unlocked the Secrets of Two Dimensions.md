In the video, Shannon Mack and her team explain how they have been able to control the filling of electrons in atoms, changing the chemistry of materials. This has opened up a new era of scientific alchemy, allowing for the design of materials with unusual states of matter. This is just the beginning of a new era of discovery in physics.
