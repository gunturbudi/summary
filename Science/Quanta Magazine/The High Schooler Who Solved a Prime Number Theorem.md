A high schooler from Massachusetts Institute of Technology proved a Prime Number Theorem that had been baffling him for years in high school. Larson's method relied on a breakthrough from a few years ago in number theory involving looking at small gaps between prime numbers and his results showed that there are comical numbers between prime numbers and 2N.

Seventeen-year-old Daniel Larson from Massachusetts Institute of Technology proved a Prime Number Theorem that had been baffling him for years in high school. Larson's method relied on a breakthrough from a few years ago in number theory involving looking at small gaps between prime numbers and his results showed that there are comical numbers between prime numbers and 2N. Larson's paper was sent to Granville, an expert in the field, and Lawson, a person Larson had never heard of, who replied with ideas and real ideas for further study. This article is a great example of the welcoming community of mathematicians, as even the most elite mathematicians are willing to help a new person learn the ropes.
