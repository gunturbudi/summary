The completion of the human genome is discussed in this video. While the first survey of the genome was celebrated in 2003, it wasn't until recently that the most biologically important parts were fully sequenced and understood. More exploration and discovery is needed through the sequencing of diverse individuals to fully understand the variations that make us human and the biological and clinical implications that come with it.

In this section, the significance of the completion of the human genome is discussed. While the first survey of the human genome was celebrated in 2003, it wasn't until recently that the most biologically important parts of our genome, such as centromeres and certain chromosomes, were fully sequenced and understood. With the completion of this one genome, there is still much to explore and discover through the sequencing of diverse individuals to fully understand the variations that make us human and the biological and clinical implications that come with it.
