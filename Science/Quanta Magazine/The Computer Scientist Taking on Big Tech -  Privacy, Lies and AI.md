Sure, here's the transcript excerpt: "In this section, Arvind Narayanan, a computer science professor at Princeton University, discusses the issue of privacy and accountability in tech. He shares his research revealing how privacy assurances by companies may not accurately stand up to scrutiny, leading to Silicon Valley taking on Silicon Valley. Narayanan also discusses his concerns about the reliability and ethics of AI technologies, particularly in consequential decision-making such as lending or parole, which he argues are barely better than random chance and may introduce racial biases. He emphasizes the importance of community input in the decision-making process for AI and technology, especially when deploying them rapidly."
