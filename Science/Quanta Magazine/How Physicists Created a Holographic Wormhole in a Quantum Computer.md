Physicists have been trying to create a wormhole for decades, and in 2013, they were finally able to do so using quantum entanglement and black holes. This breakthrough opens up a new frontier in physics, and allows for further exploration of quantum states that are otherwise very hard to realize in nature.

Physicists have created a holographic wormhole in a quantum computer, demonstrating that traversable wormholes do exist. They needed the courage of their own convictions to try, and they learned a lot in the process.

Physicists have created a holographic wormhole in a quantum computer. The wormhole preserves the gravitational features of the original system, while throwing away all the unnecessary components. The machine learning managed to keep all of the dynamics intact while making a much smaller system. This was the first moment where they "knew it might be possible."
