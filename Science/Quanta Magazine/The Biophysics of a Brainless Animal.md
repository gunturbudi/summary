Researchers at Stanford University's Prakash Lab studied the Trichoplax, the simplest animal at the base of the tree of life, to discover how it exhibits complex behaviours despite not having a nervous system. By studying the cilia on the underside of the Trichoplax, the researchersÂ designed a mathematical model to measure each cilium's orientation, height and beat frequency, discovering that the cilia exhibited dynamics similar to those seen in individual neurons. This coordinated activity suggests that basic mechanics could give rise to incredibly complex behaviour, opening up new research into using internal dynamics to give passive materials a trace amount of intelligence, allowing for the creation of intelligence without complex artificial systems.

In this section, the researchers at Stanford University's Prakash Lab discuss their study on Trichoplax, the simplest animal at the base of the tree of life, and how it exhibits complex behaviours despite not having a nervous system. By studying the tiny waving filaments called cilia on the underside of the Trichoplax, the researchers discovered that it "walks" instead of swims, and they designed a mathematical model to measure the orientation, height, and beat frequency of each individual cilium as it balanced torque from its neighbouring cells. These cilia cells exhibited dynamics similar to those seen in individual neurons, synchronizing their movement like a flock of birds. This coordinated activity, which resembles groupings of castor wheels attached by springs, demonstrates that basic mechanics could give rise to incredibly complex behaviour, which emphasizes the idea that mechanical systems could somehow be intelligent.

In this section, the biologist discusses the potential implications of Trichoplax's simple mechanics in the evolution of animals with nervous systems. She states that the understanding gained from studying Trichoplax could lead to the creation of soft robotic self-oscillators, consensus-making caster robots, and predictive machines. This opens up a new field of research on how to use internal dynamics to give passive materials a trace amount of intelligence. It is an exciting prospect because it allows for the creation of intelligence without complex artificial systems.
