The video discusses the theory of criticality, which posits that certain systems (such as the brain) exhibit self-organized criticality, which is a state of perfect balance between order and chaos. The video then goes on to discuss some of the criticisms of the theory, which include the difficulty of accurately predicting criticality in complex systems and the fact that the brain is constantly receiving inputs from outside that could blow it off of the critical point. However, the theory continues to be a popular topic of research for those interested in understanding how the brain works.

Detail Summary:

Critical phenomena arise at transitions, and self-organized criticality is the principle that many complex systems in the natural world self-organize around a critical point. This principle has been demonstrated in a simplified system known as the Ising model, and scale invariance is another way of saying that there is self-similarity or fractality at the critical point.

Research is ongoing into the possibility that the brain operates in a quasi-critical state, which may be responsible for tuning intelligence. Scientists are exploring potential mechanisms behind this phenomenon, with some believing that an equation may explain how the brain works. However, most believe that criticality is not the answer to everything and that it should not be oversold. The video ends with a discussion of how society is organized and how this may help explain the richness of the brain.
