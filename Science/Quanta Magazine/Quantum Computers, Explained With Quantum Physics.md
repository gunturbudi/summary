Quantum computers are powered by amplitudes, which are complex numbers that obey different rules from probabilities. They can store and manipulate vast amounts of data, which is why they are so powerful. However, they are not effective for performing classical calculations, since they need to be measured in order to get an output. There have been a few major breakthroughs in quantum algorithms in the past, but it is still unclear whether they will have practical applications in the near future.
