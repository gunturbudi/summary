Leslie Lamport, a computer scientist and the creator of the TLA+ language, emphasizes the importance of mathematical thinking in programming and the difference between programming and coding. He developed the bakery algorithm to solve mutual exclusion problems without making assumptions that most other algorithms do and is proud of its flawlessness. Lamport also discussed his interest in distributed systems and used his knowledge of special relativity to realize that causality was violated in an algorithm for implementing distributed databases. He believes that working in industry has opened him up to a vast plethora of problem-solving approaches that have helped in his research.

In this section, Leslie Lamport, a computer scientist who started as a programmer, explains that he didn't realize he was a computer scientist until he published enough papers. He explains the importance of proving algorithms and the difference between programming and coding, saying programming involves mental effort while coding is just typing. Lamport emphasizes the importance of mathematical thinking in programming and discusses the development of his language TLA+ for writing down program ideas before any coding. He also describes his interest in distributed systems and how he used his knowledge of special relativity to realize that causality was violated in an algorithm for implementing distributed databases.

In this section, Leslie Lamport talks about his contribution to computer science with the idea of a distributed system where all computers cooperate to implement a single state machine. He highlights his favorite algorithm, the bakery algorithm, which he developed to solve mutual exclusion problems while not making assumptions that most other algorithms make. He insisted that his idea of working in industry has opened him up to a world of a vast plethora of problem-solving approaches that have helped in his research. Leslie speaks fondly of his chance discovery of the beauty and the flawlessness of his algorithm that he never intended, and he is proud of it.
