The YouTube video "Apple Glasses Are Coming - Here's Why" argues that Apple is working on creating smart, augmented reality glasses based on their recent acquisitions and expertise in hardware and design. The development of ARKit allows developers to work on AR technology without knowledge of future Apple glasses, which maintains secrecy. However, the iGlasses must overcome challenges such as design quality, overcoming creepy associations with camera glasses, and succeeding in marketing and mass adoption. The goal is to create a foundation for a bright and innovative future of personal technology.

In this section, the video discusses the challenges that Apple will face with their potential release of the iGlasses, which will be their take on a new kind of technological accessory that provides more personal technology to its users. Glasses are, of course, not a new product or idea, and Apple is by no means the first company to develop them. The technology and design of these glasses must be of a high quality to make them efficient, but they also have to overcome the challenge of creepiness and the negative associations people have with having a camera on their face all day. Furthermore, if Apple does release these glasses, they must attempt to succeed in the area of mass adoption and marketing. Apple's goal is to create a new product line and create a foundation for a bright and innovative future of personal technology.
