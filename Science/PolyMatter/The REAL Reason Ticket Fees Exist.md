In this section, we learn that the selling of concert tickets is not a particularly hard task, except for dealing with the surge in traffic that occurs when tickets go on sale. TicketMaster failed spectacularly in this regard during Taylor Swift's recent "Eras" tour presale, with traumatized fans experiencing high service fees, cryptic error messages, and exorbitant price tags. Despite this, the reason service fees are so high is that companies like TicketMaster price tickets well below their market value to avoid excluding fans and injuring their image.

In this section, the video explains how artists secretly withhold their best seats and sell them through brokers in order to balance their interests in protecting their image with affordable primary ticket prices while also profiting off of expensive secondary sales. The video also clarifies that TicketMaster has monopolized the industry by exclusively contracting venues, but the company is able to secure these contracts by offering to pay the venues and promising a guaranteed source of revenue through service fees. The video concludes that splitting TicketMaster into two wouldn't solve the problem of higher service fees since different ticketing companies would still aim to give venues more money through such fees.

In this section, the video explains that TicketMaster acts as a reputational shield for artists, who outsource the ticketing part of their business to TicketMaster. The top 1% of artists hold an extraordinary amount of power in negotiating the terms of the contract, and they may demand as much as 105% of the total ticket sales, which leads to the high costs, including service fees and expensive food items. While TicketMaster and artists are both complicit, the video suggests that the real hope lies with the artists, who can negotiate on behalf of their fans for better terms that could benefit everyone. Examples of bands standing up for their fans are also given, highlighting that fan activism has driven positive changes in the industry in the past.
