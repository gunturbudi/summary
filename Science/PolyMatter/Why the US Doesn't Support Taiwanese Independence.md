The US does not support Taiwanese independence and instead practices a strategy of deliberate ambiguity, attempting to satisfy China's stringent demands while giving up as little as possible. The US recognizes the People's Republic of China as the "sole legal government of China" and only acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China. The issue of the future status of Taiwan is considered the primary issue that divides parties, but both sides mostly agree that maintaining the status quo is the best short-to-medium term strategy. While the US opposes both a forceful unification by China and a unilateral declaration of independence by Taiwan, it advocates for the process towards a peaceful resolution of the issue.

In this section, the video explains that the US does not support Taiwanese independence and practices a strategy of deliberate ambiguity. The US recognized the People's Republic of China in 1979 as the "sole legal government of China" and ended official relations with Taiwan, but it only acknowledged the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China. The video argues that the American position is to obfuscate and give up as little as possible while narrowly satisfying China's stringent demands. This has only delayed the issue and created hurt feelings and accusations.

In this section, it is explained that the US doesn't support Taiwan's independence, but rather maintains its own policy towards Taiwan. The US ended its defense treaty with Taiwan and passed the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taiwan with the necessary weapons to defend itself, although it does not guarantee military support. The issue of the future status of Taiwan is still the primary issue that divides parties, but both sides mostly agree that maintaining the status quo is the best short-to-medium term strategy. The US opposes both a forceful unification by China and a unilateral declaration of independence by Taiwan, as both actions would destabilize the region. Although the US does not support independence, it does advocate for the process and opposes any dangerous antagonizing actions.

In this section, the video discusses how Taiwanese officials have gone out of their way to avoid rocking the boat and prove they don't plan on pursuing independence, despite the growing Taiwanese identity among the younger generation. While America and Taiwan support the current status quo for now, it is considered untenable in the long run. However, China may believe time is on its side as its military and economy grow stronger, while the US seems to be losing interest in being a world police force.
