This video discusses how China's investment in Africa is not as efficient as it could be, and how this lack of efficiency is a danger to Africa.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
The video discusses how China has been investing in African countries with the intention of extracting resources and exploiting the countries' populations. The Hambantota port and airport project, which lost $230 million, is a prime example of this.

This 1-minute video discusses how China has come to dominate Africa's infrastructure development, mainly through low-interest loans and cheap construction. Corruption has been an issue, with some projects going poorly and others going well due to corrupt officials.

00:10:00
This video discusses how corruption is rampant in China's overseas investments, with the majority of projects benefiting local politicians and Chinese developers at the expense of the people. There is no evidence that China purposely entangles other countries in debt, and experts attribute China's slightly higher lending to its sheer scale, rather than corruption.

00:15:00
The video discusses China's investment in Africa and how it is not a Marshall Plan on steroids or one giant trojan horse designed to bankrupt poor countries and put the People's Liberation Army in every corner of the globe. Instead, it is a vague and amorphous project with no clear definition or grand strategy. This lack of efficiency is a danger to Africa, as the same inefficiencies that characterizes the Chinese domestic economy are now being replicated abroad.
