The video "How Coup d'états REALLY Work" explains the basic steps to executing a coup and the characteristics that make a country vulnerable to it. The first step involves dividing the current government into allies, indifferent pragmatists, and enemies. After freezing movement and information and arresting the current government, the key is to transform symbolic power into actual power and convince people that the new regime is legitimate. However, the challenge is to maintain power since coups both cause and are the product of a lack of legitimacy, leading to a downward spiral of normalization and apathy.

In this section, we learn that coups have become more prevalent in recent years, with six countries experiencing a coup attempt in 2021 alone. While the basic steps for executing a coup have remained the same for over 50 years, there are certain characteristics that make a coup more or less likely to succeed. Countries with a high concentration of power, low political participation, and a lack of redundancy in government are more vulnerable to coup attempts. It is crucial for the coup organizers to infiltrate the government and gain support from key players in order to succeed.

In this section of the video on how coup d'etats work, we learn that drawing a giant org chart of the current government, which includes everyone from the Prime Minister to his limo driver, is crucial. The next step is dividing everyone into one of three categories: Allies, indifferent pragmatists, and enemies. Allies are those whose active support is needed, and if there are multiple candidates for a given role, the less qualified among them will be picked. Enemies are those who are loyal to the ruling party. If they are loud but powerless figureheads or in distant wars, it’s okay, otherwise, they are distracted at the time of the coup. Every other person is an "indifferent pragmatist" not loyal to any particular party or ideology. The final step involves freezing movement and information and arresting the current government. The secret weapon is chaos and confusion; as long as the average person does not know what’s going on, the disorder will be indistinguishable from a natural disaster.

In this section, the speaker explains that simply occupying the physical symbols of power is not enough to complete a coup. The challenge is to transform symbolic power into actual power and convince people that the new regime is legitimate. The speaker cautions that the positive feedback loop that comes with this task can work against the coup makers if they slow down or reveal any seams in their rule. The key to maintaining power, therefore, is speed and a dramatic televised address followed by re-distributing land or doing something else rash to increase momentum. The speaker also warns that it is difficult to hold on to power because coups both cause and are the product of a lack of legitimacy, leading to a downward spiral of normalization and apathy.
