Hong Kong's public transit system, the MTR, is profitable thanks to its unique business model that allows it to sell businesses access to the 90% of the population that takes the train. This strategy, called Rail + Property, lets the MTR profit from transit operations and property development, making it self-sufficient without relying on government funding. However, this approach has led to a housing crisis in which Hong Kongers live in tiny, dirty homes due to land restrictions and high prices. Additionally, the MTR has been used to hinder protests by closing stations in and around protest areas during the weekends. The video also promotes an online course with Brilliant that teaches users about machine learning algorithms.

In this section, it is explained how Hong Kong's public transit system is both efficient and profitable, something that few other systems in the world can claim. Unlike most other cities where public transit is seen as a public good and is often subsidized, Hong Kong's MTR pays for itself and is profitable. This is achieved through a unique business model whereby the MTR sells businesses access to the 90% of the population that takes the train, allowing the MTR to determine where Hong Kongers go. Despite being profitable, Hong Kong's public transit remains affordable, with fares paying for 185% of the operating expenses, and it plays a key role in the daily lives of the majority of the city's residents.

In this section, we learn about the MTR Corporation's Rail + Property strategy which allows them to profit from transit operations and property development. In fact, the company made more money from property development, rent, and commercial business in 2018 than from fares. This strategy allows the MTR to maintain efficient, market-based operations without relying on government funding. However, the catch is that the MTR and the government's perverse incentives to restrict land rights and drive up prices are part of the reason for the housing crisis in which Hong Kongers live in tiny, dirty homes. Furthermore, the MTR has become a tool to hinder protestors as stations in and around protests are regularly closed during the weekends effectively cutting off most of the population from arriving.
