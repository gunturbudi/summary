The video discusses the history of North Korea and its relationship with the Soviet Union, which led to the country receiving a nuclear reactor in 1959. North Korea has repeatedly broken promises made during these negotiations, and has been known for its erratic behavior and propensity for violence. Despite this, sanctions have not been able to dissuade the country from pursuing nuclear weapons. The video concludes with a discussion of the reasons why sanctions have not been effective against North Korea, and suggests that the country's history of deception makes it difficult to trust them.

Sanctions do not work to change the behavior of North Korea, and may actually incentivize the country to continue developing its nuclear and missile programs in order to maintain its survival. While they may cause some short-term pain for the people of North Korea, they ultimately do not achieve any long-term goals.

The author argues that sanctions do not work against North Korea because of the country's history of violating agreements, its lack of political continuity, and its development of advanced weapons technology. He also argues that funding is a major obstacle to successful sanctions, and that presidents can only negotiate commitments that are approved by Congress.

The video discusses the difficulty of applying economic sanctions against North Korea due to the country's size, leader, and lack of control over its economy. It also discusses the challenges of applying sanctions in Cuba, which has seen a decline in tourism despite its natural environment being untouched. The bonus video accompanying the main video explores the dilemma of whether or not Cuba can keep its beaches pristine.
