Since 2007, Venezuela's government has engaged in big-spending and currency printing to keep the population from going hungry, but this has caused rampant inflation. This has led to shortages of many goods, and people have taken to smuggling in order to get the things they need. Meanwhile, the government has erected barriers to international trade, making it difficult for multinationals to get the currency they need to import essential goods.

Venezuela's economy collapsed in the early 2000s due to mismanagement and corruption. In order to try to fix the economy, the government has turned to offering handouts in the form of foreign currency. This has created an environment where people can arbitrage the exchange rate, creating money out of thin air. The government blames the problems on individual opportunists, and argues that the country's culture of selfish consumption is to blame. However, the video argues that the problem is much deeper and that the government's policies are not capable of fixing it.
