The video argues that China is not a socialist country, despite the Communist Party's claims. It cites the rise of capitalism and consumerism, as well as increasing class distinctions, as evidence that the country is moving away from socialism.

Detail Summary:

The Chinese Communist Party died in 1985 when Deng Xiaoping said that state policy was to “let some people get rich first.” With that, the façade of socialism was gone and it became clear that China was moving towards capitalism. This is evidenced by the proliferation of McDonald’s and KFC, the rise of consumerism, and the increasing class distinctions. Today, under Xi Jinping, it is even more clear that China is a capitalist country masquerading as socialist.

The video examines the different interpretations of China's history after the death of Mao Zedong, and how that affects the perception of China as a socialist country today. It argues that while Deng Xiaoping's reforms did allow for some liberalization of the economy, the Chinese government still maintains a lot of control and censorship.

In China, the Leftist movement is making a comeback after years of being at the mercy of the Reformist-led Communist Party. This is due to several global crises that have tipped the balance in favor of the Leftists, as well as the popularity of Bo Xilai, who is described as a "mini-Mao".

The Communist Party of China does not claim to be a Communist State, but rather a Socialist State. This is because Communism is a Utopian destination that even its most ardent supporters don't believe is on the horizon anytime soon.

The party was only ever going to deviate from its origins so much, and the writing has been on the wall since 1980. The other common justification for the party is the argument that, despite its “flaws”, it did “lift” 800 million people out of poverty. But there’s just one problem: it’s not really true.
