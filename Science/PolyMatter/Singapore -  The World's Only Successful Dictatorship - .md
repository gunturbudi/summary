# Summary of Singapore: The World's Only Successful Dictatorship?

Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=Hkxf4SC_SBk

The video discusses Singapore's political system, considered by many as a "thinly veiled dictatorship" in which the People's Action Party has been in power for six decades without any opposition. Despite having some of the world's best healthcare, education, and public housing systems, the government has shown resistance to democracy, using various tools to disadvantage the opposition, including censorship extending to the media, and criminalizing protests. The ruling party has shown no accountability, deciding when, where, and how elections take place, and arresting or bankrupting anyone it wishes. The video suggests that introducing democratic reforms in Singapore could lead to more durable support and an increase in loyal workers for Singapore Incorporated, but it is crucial to hope that Singapore does not devolve into nationalism and crushing the opposition while expecting the People's Action Party to take the progressive path.

In this section, the transcript discusses Singapore's political system as a "thinly veiled dictatorship" that operates as a corporation for corporations. The country's lack of natural resources forced it to rely on foreign investment, making it design the perfect environment for multinational megacorporations. Although the People's Action Party was democratically elected, it eliminated all forms of "instability" and has been in power for six consecutive decades. While there are free and fair elections, opposition parties don't expect to defeat the PAP. Despite this, Singapore has some of the world's best healthcare, education, and public housing systems, all designed to keep citizens and expat workers healthy and happy to maintain productivity.

In this section, it is highlighted that the secret to Singapore's success is its 6 decades of uninterrupted power, zero accountability, and no opposition that has enabled the government to support rapid economic growth without facing any hindrances. However, the government has shown resistance to democracy, using various tools like gerrymandering, lawsuits, token opposition parties, and sedition acts to disadvantage the opposition. The ruling party decides when, where, and how elections take place, and it can arrest or bankrupt anyone it wishes. Singaporeans have been insulated from alternatives, and protests are illegal unless pre-approved by the government. Censorship extends to the media as well, where the government has the power to install editors of its choice and revoke the media license of anyone not sufficiently cooperative.

In this section, the video explains that Singapore's traditional outlets, including The Straits Times, serve as government mouthpieces, and the PAP has begun taking on social media platforms like Facebook using the "Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation" Bill, which grants the ministers up for election the ability to force their opponents to correct or remove their statements online, or risk incarceration. The current prime minister criticized voters who supported the opposition as "free-riders," revealing his views on democracy, which makes it clear that only one number is relevant for the party: the share of votes it receives. This has led to frustrated opposition voters, and the PAP presented plain trade-offs to influence them to vote for PAP, such as maintaining public housing maintenance priority for PAP voters. The PAP calls "irrational behavior" to honest and fair protests and treating the vote as a form of message. Finally, it's clear that voters like the PAP and have doubts about the alternatives, but if elections were fair, citizens would likely vote fairly as well.

In this section, the video discusses the potential benefits of introducing democratic reforms in Singapore, which could lead to more durable support and an increase in loyal workers for Singapore Incorporated. However, the video also highlights the failure of people to see the real problem with Singapore due to their focus on comical and outlandish policies such as the chewing gum ban or astronomical fines for littering. The lack of accountability in the authoritarian government could lead to a massive gamble that could crumble at any moment if a less benevolent party or politician were to win power. Therefore, it is crucial to hope that Singapore does not devolve into nationalism and crushing the opposition while expecting the People's Action Party to take the progressive path.
