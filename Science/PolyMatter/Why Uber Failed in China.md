# Summary of Why Uber Failed in China

This video explores the reasons behind Uber's failure in the Chinese market, which stem from the company's unsuccessful expansion strategy that did not account for China's market and regulatory differences. Uber's entire business model did not work in China, where it faced difficulties scaling up quickly, an unclear regulatory environment, and intense competition from Didi, backed by China's tech giants Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent. Uber lost market share to Didi, which had more daily active users, and, in July 2016, new government regulations had been passed, legalizing the ride-hailing industry but prohibiting subsidies, leading Uber to sell to Didi. Despite its failure, the transition resulted in a source of pure profit, valued at seven billion dollars, and allowed Uber to redirect its resources and investments to other promising markets in Southeast Asia and beyond.

In this section, we see that Uber failed in China due to its unsuccessful expansion strategy that did not account for China’s market and regulatory differences. Although Uber made an effort to build “Uber China,” partnering with local investors like Baidu and launching in the country’s largest city, it faced difficulties such as using US credit card support, Google Maps, and an unclear regulatory environment. Uber's entire business model was also a problem as it did not own the cars, hire drivers, and could not scale up quickly in China, unlike its primary competitor, Didi, which connected existing licensed taxi drivers to riders. Ultimately, Didi’s near-monopoly control backed by all three of China’s tech giants Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent, led to Uber’s exit from China.

In this section, it is explained that Uber lost a game of chicken with Didi by spending $40-50 million US dollars per week on free rides and bonuses in China. This resulted in Uber losing a substantial amount of money, creating fraud issues, and even supposedly led to Didi sending undercover engineers to be hired by Uber to collect trade secrets and conduct sabotage. Fraud was a significant issue facing Uber's services in China as fake rides were being taken daily with the use of circuit boards and fake phones. Uber was forced to create a database of IMEI numbers to identify scammers but was hindered by Apple's privacy policy, preventing them from detecting fraud. The final nail in the coffin for Uber was that it had to operate in a legal grey area in China, where municipal governments were not favorable to its cause. Uber lost market share to Didi, which had more daily active users, and in July 2016, new government regulations had been passed, legalizing the ride-hailing industry but prohibiting subsidies, leading Uber to sell to Didi. Despite Uber's failure to conquer the Chinese market as planned, the transition resulted in a source of pure profit, valued at seven billion dollars.
