China's reputation as a global power was built largely during the 2008 Summer Olympics, when Beijing underwent a physical and cultural transformation in preparation. However, after joining the World Trade Organization and experiencing a decade of rapid economic growth, China has become more aggressive and needlessly burned bridges with its neighbors. Today, Chinese diplomats use social media to share mundane updates about the National People's Congress.

China's reputation has taken a battering in recent years, due to its hostility and actions, including a crackdown on tech giant Jack Ma, as well as its negative perceptions among other countries. Some claim that China's rise has made it immune to this negative sentiment, but the clip also examines how this has only served to make China even more disliked.
