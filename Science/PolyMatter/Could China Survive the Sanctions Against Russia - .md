# Summary of Could China Survive the Sanctions Against Russia?

Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=Vnwji5doAbs

The video explores whether China could survive the sanctions that were imposed on Russia. It compares the economic situations of the two countries and suggests that China is more intertwined with the global economy than Russia. However, the video also cautions that trade is a crude proxy for interdependence, and changing circumstances could significantly impact China's economic situation. The video then discusses the dependence of China's semiconductor industry on Western imports and how a total trade blockade on China would be an act of war. Finally, it is stated that China controls access to rare earth elements, which are crucial for modern technology, and this is discussed in the third episode of the Nebula Original series "China, Actually".

In this section, the video compares the economic situations of Russia and China and argues that China is much more intertwined with the global economy than Russia. While Russia is largely insulated and more reliant on China as a trading partner, China has a diverse set of trading partners which includes allies of the United States. However, the video cautions that trade is a crude proxy for interdependence and that changing circumstances could significantly impact China's economic situation.

In this section, it is explained that while China tried to bully Australia through tariffs, duties, bans, and boycotts over what it saw as "14 grievances", Australia was able to turn the tides to its favor by finding new buyers in Russia and Indonesia, leading to a new equilibrium in trade. Although a disruption in trade may cause some congestion, it is not always as catastrophic as it may seem, depending on what is being traded. However, advanced technology poses a more significant challenge as China remains dependent on foreign imports, particularly in semiconductors, and the industry would be forced to regress about 40 years if maximum sanctions were applied.

In this section, it is explained that China's semiconductor industry is currently deeply dependent on Western imports, and sanctions against Russia would worsen the situation. Even though researchers have found that the country has a shortage of 300,000 semiconductor engineers, China is blocked from accessing crucial ingredients required to make the smallest chips, like the Dutch lithography machines. Thus, the semiconductor industry needs billions of dollars and years of patience. Also, it's difficult for Chinese banks and intermediaries to buy sanctioned parts, which deepens dependence on Western imports.

In this section, it is stated that a total trade blockade on China would be an act of war and seizing their foreign exchange like the US did with Russia is unlikely. However, China does control access to rare earth elements, which are crucial for modern technology. Deng Xiaoping even proclaimed that "China has rare earths" in 1992. This is discussed in the third episode of the Nebula Original series "China, Actually", which also covers Chinese censorship and the reason behind their refusal to allow a single case of coronavirus.
