# Summary of The Obscure Law that Killed U.S. Maritime Shipping

The Jones Act, a 103-year-old law that mandates all cargo transported between two U.S. ports be carried on American-built, -owned, and -crewed ships, is the topic of this video. The law significantly impacts the cost of building and operating American ships, which are more expensive due to American labor costs, driving up the cost per unit. As a result, American-built ships are five times more expensive than foreign-built ships, making it difficult for them to compete with foreign ships. This has led America to shift from maritime to other forms of transport, which comes at a cost to American taxpayers. The Act also affects captive markets of Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam, creating price gouging and few shipping choices for locals. The video argues that the Jones Act serves as a protective measure for powerful unions and their lobbyists, who have held America's remarkable geographic potential hostage.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
In this section, we learn that the United States has all the inputs necessary to be self-sufficient, including abundant and diverse resources as well as the unique advantage of a vast coastline for easy transportation. However, the country sources a relatively small share of its trade domestically, despite producing nearly as much of certain goods, such as oil, as it consumes. The reason for this is largely due to the Jones Act, a 103-year-old law that requires ships moving goods between American ports to be built, crewed, owned, and registered in the US, creating an unnecessary and inefficient impediment to the US economy. Meanwhile, foreign ships can still move goods between American ports and elsewhere, making trade routes increasingly complex.

In this section, the video explains the impact of the Jones Act on the cost of building and operating American ships, which are more expensive due to American labor not being cheap. Because of this, U.S. shipbuilders build fewer ships, driving up the cost per unit. Consequently, the feedback cycle has significantly increased the cost of American-built ships - they're five times more expensive than foreign-built ships - making it difficult for them to compete with foreign ships. As a result, America has seen a shift from maritime to every other form of transport, with shipping anything domestically by water becoming a last resort. This shift comes at a cost to American taxpayers in terms of traffic jams, carbon emissions, and lost revenue.

In this section, we learn about how the Jones Act affects the captive markets of Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam, which have no roads or trains connecting them to the mainland, making shipping their only means of exchanging goods. The Act creates price gouging and price fixing, with two companies controlling over 80% of the US mainland to Puerto Rico market. Similarly, Alaska is subject to a TOTE and Matson duopoly. Because of inadequate competition, transportation costs skyrocket and limit supply. Puerto Ricans, for example, pay more for American products than foreign countries. Those who lobby to keep the Jones Act argue that it is hard to know for sure how much it limits the US economy's scope.

In this section, the video explains that the Coast Guard will seize a ship with a foreign-built hull, but not if it has a foreign-built engine, and that up to 1.5% of the steel weight of the superstructure can be foreign. The government has prepared a 29-page PDF with definitions for obscure terms and unusual interpretations of words. The Jones Act was created to guarantee a sizable US fleet in times of need and prevent over-stretching, but there just aren't very many American ships. The U.S. Military was stretched to its limits during the First World War, but the Jones Act appears to have worked since then, though the majority of the 40,000 U.S. ships are barges and tugboats. The key argument in favor of the Jones Act is that "national security" is simply too important, but the United States already has a stockpile of militarily-useful ships on reserve.

In this section, the video argues that the Jones Act, a century-old law that mandates all cargo transported between two U.S. ports be carried on American-built, -owned, and -crewed ships, essentially serves as a protective measure for a small group of powerful unions and their lobbyists, who have held America's remarkable geographic potential hostage. While foreign ships are apparently good enough for the U.S. military when it comes to non-military commercial ships, we're told to think about "national security."
