The video "The Problem with Foreign Aid" discusses the ineffectiveness of foreign aid and how it often goes to dictators instead of helping the people it was intended to. The video suggests that a better solution would be to conditionally give aid, which would be given in a steady flow that stops when the goal is achieved.

The Problem with Foreign Aid video explains why aid is ineffective, often going to dictators instead of helping the people it was intended to. Foreign aid is also a way for countries to trade for policy, with the advantage of appearing more like charity. It is easy for a democratic politician to overcome damage to his public opinion when he has more money to spend. Foreign aid can be a way for a leader to increase their power, by buying policies to help him stay in office. Foreign aid can also be a way for a dictator to move money they had previously spent on citizens into their own wallets.

Foreign aid is ineffective and can backfire, as it often goes to dictators who refuse to change their behavior. Better solutions may be to conditionally give aid, rather than give it up front, and to give it in a steady flow that stops when the goal is achieved. Democratically-elected politicians should use this strategy.
