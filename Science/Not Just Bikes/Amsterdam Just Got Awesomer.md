The video discusses Amsterdam Central Station, which has been under construction for the past few years. The recent completion of the construction projects allows for a more spacious and modern area for pedestrians, cyclists, and buses. Additionally, a new tunnel for walking and cycling has been created, which makes it very easy to access the ferry terminal at the back of the station.

The new bicycle parking garage at Amsterdam Central is beautiful and accessible, and it's great that it's underground so that it stays dry in the rain. Unfortunately, the other two Amsterdam train stations do not have bicycle parking facilities, and one of them does not even have a cover over the entrance.

The author describes two Amsterdam bicycle garages - one at the station, and another underground. The author likes the underground garage better because it is less crowded and has nicer artwork.
