This video discusses General Motors' 1954 propaganda film "Give Yourself the Green Light," which aimed to generate public support for increased funding for highways. The film shows how the future of cars and highways was viewed in the post-war period, and it is the source of many of the problems with American cities that the author discusses in other videos. The author points out that we have become the nation on wheels, but that our roads are not up to the task of carrying the increasing traffic. He also points out that many Highway projects are pitched as ways of speeding up Trucking, but we now know that these projects are not only used for Trucking, but that suburbs and excerbs get built along with them.
