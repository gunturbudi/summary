# Summary of Stroads are Ugly, Expensive, and Dangerous (and they're everywhere) [ST05]

The video discusses strodes, which are dangerous and ineffective hybrids of streets and roads that prioritize cars and high speeds over pedestrians, cyclists, and public transport. Strodes are expensive to build and maintain, and their design encourages high volumes of traffic, resulting in congestion and low productivity. The Netherlands has revolutionized its road system by prioritizing sustainable traffic safety, and the video suggests that the US and Canada should redesign their roads into single-lane streets that value pedestrians, cyclists, and public transport. This would result in safer, more efficient, and inviting roads that benefit everyone.

In this section, the video explains the concept of strodes, which are a dangerous, expensive, and ineffective hybrid of a street and a road. Unlike streets, strodes have multiple highway-sized lanes with many points of conflict, making it uncomfortable and dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists. They are also uninviting and ugly, with large signs and the absence of trees in the clear zone. While they are designed to keep vehicles at high speeds for as long as possible, the strode fails to be effective as a road since drivers cannot get anywhere quickly due to constant changes in lanes and a lack of easy access points.

In this section, the dangers and negative effects of strodes are discussed. Strodes have high traffic volumes because there are no viable alternatives to driving, such as walking or cycling, and public transit gets stuck in traffic. Strodes require traffic lights due to the many crossroads entrances and exits, resulting in traffic signal-induced congestion. Furthermore, the wide and straight design of strodes encourages drivers to drive quickly, making them especially dangerous to people walking and cycling. Strodes are expensive to build and maintain and contribute to low-density living, resulting in low productivity and tax revenue. The alternative proposed by Strong Towns is to convert strodes either into roads or streets, limiting access, and bringing everything down to a human scale, making it inviting to people and getting more value from the space available.

In this section, the video discusses how the Netherlands has completely revolutionized their road system by implementing sustainable traffic safety and classifying every road and street under three categories. The first type is the stromwech, which is a motorway or highway with no traffic controls, cars enter and exit through merge lanes, and traffic isn't allowed through cities. The second type is the distributor road or roads that connect highways and streets while avoiding driveways to residences or businesses. The last type is the airftuchongswech or neighborhood access streets, designed with low speed, one motor vehicle lane per direction and a limit of 30 kilometers per hour, and they mostly cater to residential areas with safety measures that encourage bike riding, walking, and public transit over cars. The video shows examples of each type of road and how they have improved safety, efficiency, and aesthetics.

In this section, the video showcases the benefits of redesigning roads into single lane streets instead of strodes. Single lane streets are much safer due to a lack of conflict points between vehicles and easier pedestrian crossings. They also allow for more space for car parking, bike lanes, and sidewalks. The road can then become two lanes for cars with turning lanes when necessary, reserving one lane for buses and providing a two-way cycling path that is isolated from the road. Because bus lanes and bike paths are more efficient than car lanes, this configuration can actually transport more people. The video concludes that the US and Canada need to rethink their traffic engineering manuals to build safer and more productive streets and roads.
