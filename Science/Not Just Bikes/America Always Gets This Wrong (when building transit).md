# Summary of America Always Gets This Wrong (when building transit)

Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=MnyeRlMsTgI

The video discusses why public transit in North America is often seen as inefficient, and how cities and buildings are designed for cars rather than transit. The speaker emphasizes the importance of combining good land use plans with transit plans to create a successful public transit system. However, transit projects in North America are often built without considering land use plans, which leads to underfunded and unsuccessful transit systems. To build better transit systems, the speaker suggests building mixed-use walkable neighborhoods along with transit, instead of building developments that are only accessible by car. Additionally, the video promotes signing up for the streaming services of CuriosityStream and Nebula, which offer a bundle deal for access to educational documentaries and original content from independent creators.

In this section, the video discusses why public transit in North America is often inefficient and used as a last resort. The buildings and cities are not designed for transit, but for cars instead. In order for transit to be successful, it needs to have people to ride it, destinations for those people to go to, and accessible transportation stops. However, the area around the transit stops is often subjected to the same strict regulations that prioritize cars. For example, minimum parking requirements guarantee that it is easy to park, but it also limits valuable land which could be used for commercial or residential purposes. This "car-centric" approach to designing cities is the reason why public transit is often seen as less effective in North America compared to other parts of the world.

In this section, the speaker emphasizes the importance of combining good land use plans with transit plans for a successful public transit system. In North America, however, transit plans are often built without considering land use plans. As a result, transit projects are doomed to fail, be underfunded, and struggle to gain ridership. Moreover, new developments in suburban areas are designed for driving rather than walking, which makes a transit overlay to car-centric planning. To address this problem, planners must allow and encourage walkable mixed-use developments within a 10 to 15-minute walk shed of every rapid transit station, which would enable a more gradual range of missing middle housing rather than giant condo towers next to single-family homes.

In this section, the video discusses how historically towns in the US and Canada were built next to rapid transit, but this type of development is no longer considered viable. Instead, development is often built for cars first, which leads to unconnected suburban neighborhoods that are only accessible by car. The video argues that to build better transit systems, it is essential to start building mixed-use walkable neighborhoods along with transit. While this may be beyond the capacity of many cities, there is still potential to revitalize older walkable neighborhoods and connect them with reliable transit to create a positive change. The video also suggests checking out Chuck Marone's book, "Confessions of a Recovering Engineer" for more information about how this can be done.

In this section, the speaker shares information about the benefits of signing up for the streaming services of CuriosityStream and Nebula. He mentions that CuriosityStream has numerous titles including educational documentaries, citing an example of the World of Bridges documentary about the Victoria Falls Bridge. On the other hand, he highlights that Nebula has all the content from independent creators, including bonus videos and original content. The speaker also states that by signing up through their bundle deal, users can get access to both streaming services for only $14.79 for the entire first year. The proceeds of this partnership will also support the speaker and other independent creators.
