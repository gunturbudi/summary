In this section, the video discusses why the Netherlands is the best country in the world for drivers. The country's widespread pedestrianized areas and abundance of biking infrastructure means that alternatives to driving are viable for most trips.

The video explains that the infrastructure is high quality, and the traffic generally flows smoothly, with rush hour only lasting about an hour. The video also discusses how the efficient traffic light system, with multiple detection loops, makes waiting times shorter for drivers.
