The Dutch bicycle is unique because it is an upright bicycle that is designed to be ridden in an efficient sitting position. This is more comfortable than riding in an inefficient position, and it also makes it easier to see what's going on around you. Additionally, the skirt guard prevents long articles of clothing from getting stuck in the spokes, and the frame lock keeps your key inside the bike as you ride.

Dutch bicycles are better because they are designed for practical everyday use, they are low maintenance, and they often don't come with gears or brakes. The video also explains the Plane Bicycle Project in Winnipeg, Canada, which imports used Dutch bicycles to help needy families in Canada.
