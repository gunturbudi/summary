The speaker shares his experiences of feeling unfairly judged and stereotyped as a cyclist. He talks about the difficulties of having to justify the actions of others and putting up with physical harm due to these stereotypes. The negative attitudes towards cyclists not only dehumanize them but also create an “us versus them” divide. Despite this, the installation of safer bicycle infrastructure is slowly changing things, making cycling a "normal" activity.

In this section, a man explains that he does not consider himself to be a cyclist despite riding a bike almost every day. He reveals his initiation into bicycling when he first moved to the UK for work and biking was fastest. Though he is often referred to as a cyclist, he does not feel a part of this group or culture, which comes with assumptions and negative stereotypes. Drivers are never held to the same standards as cyclists, and he and his wife feel frustrated that they are expected to justify these behaviours on behalf of their fellow cyclists.

In this section of the video, the speaker discusses the emotional responses and stereotypes typically associated with riding bicycles. Drivers often stereotype cyclists as reckless and dangerous, despite studies showing that they break the law less often than drivers. These negative attitudes can have real-world consequences, such as when police did not properly investigate the death of a cyclist. Furthermore, cyclists often face literal violence on the road, such as the concept of the "punishment pass" where drivers intentionally drive as close as possible to cyclists to intimidate them. These negative attitudes towards cyclists dehumanize them and create an “us versus them” divide.

In this section, the speaker shares his experiences of feeling unfairly judged and stereotyped as a cyclist. He talks about the difficulties of having to justify the actions of others and putting up with physical harm due to these stereotypes. The speaker admits that he understands how others can become angry cyclists, but ultimately decided to give up on cycling and take public transit instead. He explains that he doesn't want to be part of a group and be responsible for the actions of others or be forced into a position of being an activist or spokesperson. However, the speaker notes that things are slowly changing with the installation of safer bicycle infrastructure, which is attracting people of all ages who would otherwise never consider cycling, making cycling a "normal" activity.
