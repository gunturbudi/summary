This video discusses the reasons why Canadians cannot bike in the winter, but Finnish people can. The video cites examples of how Finnish cities are designed to accommodate winter biking, while Canadian cities are not. The video argues that the main reason Canadians do not bike in the winter is because cities are not designed for it, and not because of the cold or snow.

Detail Summary:

In the Netherlands, cycling is a part of everyday life and something that even young children can do safely. However, in Canada, cycling in the winter is considered impossible by many people. However, in cities like Oulu, Finland, winter cycling is commonplace. This is because there is a network of safe, well-maintained bicycle paths and the city makes an effort to connect every resident to the places they want to go.

While it is true that fewer people cycle in the winter in Canada than in Finland, this is not because it is too cold or because of the snow. Rather, it is because the infrastructure is not in place to make cycling safe and easy. In Finnish cities like Oulu, the priority bicycle routes are all plowed within 3 hours of a 2cm snowfall, and the depth of the snow is never allowed to exceed 4 cm. This is in contrast to Canadian cities like Toronto, where the bicycle paths are often not plowed at all.
