# Summary of Why We Won't Raise Our Kids in Suburbia

The speaker explains how they chose to raise their children in Amsterdam over their suburban Canadian hometown due to the greater independence and safety of children in the Netherlands, where kids can walk, cycle and play outside without constant supervision. In contrast, North American suburbs are dangerous and car-dependent, with a lack of exercise for children and strict child welfare policies discouraging independence. The speaker argues that changing cultural issues and the design of cities and suburbs are necessary to provide a safer environment which allows children to be independent and that retrofitting suburban cities is almost impossible.

In this section, the speaker explains why they chose to raise their kids in Amsterdam instead of their hometown in Canada. One major factor is the level of independence that children have in the Netherlands, where they are allowed to walk, cycle, and play outside on their own. In contrast, the speaker notes that suburban North America is desolate, dangerous for pedestrians, and car-dependent, inhibiting children's growth and independence. The speaker argues that this is due to urban design, which encourages car use and discourages walking, and that it's not actually dangerous for children to walk or cycle to school or play on their own.

In this section of the video, the speaker discusses how the lack of family-friendly housing, car-dependent suburbs and an overall change in culture has led to a drop in children walking and cycling to school in the US and Canada, while it's prevalent in the Netherlands. In the US and Canada, it's common for kids to be driven around everywhere by their parents until they're old enough to drive themselves, resulting in a lack of exercise. Moreover, many Canadians no longer believe it's safe for their children to be out on their own, this coupled with strict child welfare policies means that it's difficult for children to have the independence they deserve. The speaker cites examples of how social workers have punished parents and taken children away for simply allowing their kids to walk to school or play in the backyard.

In this section, the speaker discusses how changing cultural issues and the fundamental design of North American cities and suburbs are necessary to provide safer and more reliable ways of upbringing children. Increasing walkability and reducing car dependency can help children be independent and reduce the danger of cars, but the retrofitting of suburbs is almost impossible, and car-centric regulations make it illegal to build walkable places in Canada. The speaker and his wife decided to move to the Netherlands to provide their children with a safer and better environment for them to grow up in.
