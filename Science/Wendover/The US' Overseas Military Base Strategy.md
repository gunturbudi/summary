# Summary of The US' Overseas Military Base Strategy

Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=A0qt0hdCQtg

The US has far more overseas bases than it officially acknowledges, with omissions suggesting that the real number could be much higher than the official count of 514 sites. The US' overseas military presence helps to counteract the loss of strength gradient by allowing the country to maintain bases in allied countries at little cost, creating a forward presence and reducing the likelihood of attack. The heavy overseas military presence is also about power projection, making sure that every other country knows that America can respond to any potential threat. However, the controversial nature of US bases abroad, particularly in Okinawa, Japan, casts doubt on whether the benefits outweigh the costs of having a persistent US military presence worldwide.

In this section, it becomes clear that the US has far more overseas bases than it officially acknowledges. The official Department of Defence Base Structure Report lists only 514 sites outside American borders, but there are notable omissions, such as the secretive drone base in central Niger, and over ten sites in Syria, which are not on this list. These omissions suggest that the real count could be much higher. Overseas infrastructure forms part of the US military's Loss of Strength Gradient, which outlines the level of resources a country allocates abroad. The strategy claims that in peacetime, the US can maintain bases in allied countries at little cost, creating a forward presence and reducing the likelihood that their opponent will attack.

In this section, we learn about the concept of loss of strength gradient, which suggests that the further a conflict is from a military's home country, the less military power the country can bring to the fight. To counteract this effect, the US established bases outside its home territory, such as the Ramstein Air Base in Germany. This base plays a crucial role in the logistics hub, as a stopover point for personnel and cargo en route to combat. The base has also become essential in the US' use of drones in the Middle East, as it relays signals from the US to the Middle East by fiber optics. Beyond capability and convenience, the US' heavy overseas military presence is also about power projection, making sure that every other country knows that America can respond to any potential threat.

In this section, it is revealed that the US military has a continuous presence on every continent, including Antarctica where they deal with supplying American research bases, which is allowed by international treaty. However, the main topic of discussion is on the controversial nature of US bases abroad, particularly in Okinawa, Japan, where the bases are considered an economic, social, and environmental burden by locals. While some believe the US military bases are crucial for power projection, others consider them unnecessary and outdated, with geopolitical tensions and community detriment. It is up for debate whether the benefits outweigh the costs of having a persistent US military presence worldwide.
