Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
In the early 1970s, Angola was in the middle of a civil war between three factions vying for control of the country. Eventually, Portuguese forces were forced to retreat, and independence was declared. Since then, the city has been plagued by poverty and corruption. In 2015, however, the city experienced a brief period of luxury when a specially-configured 747 flew from Houston and dropped off 189 passengers at the airport. The passengers were mostly American oil executives and their families. The cost of a roundtrip ticket was $2,399, which was equivalent to a half year's income for the average Angolan. However, the vast majority of passengers were not Angolan, and most of the wealth in the city was concentrated in the hands of a small minority. The international school where the children of the Luanda elite were educated was also among the most expensive in the world.

Angola became a leading oil producer following its civil war, and its economy has since grown rapidly. Despite this, the country has faced several economic challenges, including high unemployment and inequality. In 2002, UNITA entered peace talks, and the civil war came to an end in 2011. Since then, Angola has seen rapid growth in its economy, with a construction boom and increasing popularity of luxury brands.

In 2002, Angola's economy grew 534%. However, the everyday Angolan was doing just about the same. In 2010, Angola's human development index ranked higher, but the country's facade started to fall in 2012. Dos Santos planned to build a million homes by 2012, but only 220 were sold due to the fact that the very working-class residents they were built for couldn't afford or finance them. In 2016, Isabel dos Santos became the country's second most powerful person after her father. However, just months later, her father announced his imminent retirement and Angola will have a new president.

In Angola, Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of the country's most powerful man, accumulated a vast fortune through shady deals. Her father was arrested on corruption and money laundering charges in 2020, and allegations of illegality mounted. The international media obtained leaked documents that corroborated many of the suspicions lobbed at dos Santos. By painstakingly pouring over the 70,000 documents, journalists helped to substantiate what skeptical onlookers had been claiming since 2013--that the dos Santos empire was hardly something to be celebrated. Rather, her ill-gotten wealth was actually going a long way in keeping average Angolans down.
