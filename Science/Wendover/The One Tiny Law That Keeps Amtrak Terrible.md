# Summary of The One Tiny Law That Keeps Amtrak Terrible

This video discusses how Amtrak, a passenger rail system, is struggling due to poor infrastructure and outdated regulations. The freight rail industry has decided to cede the timely freight market, and this has created a system of infrastructure where timeliness doesn't matter. This has led to trains being dispatched whenever they want, maintenance being deferred, and speed restrictions being imposed. In order to improve Amtrak, the country and its legislature need to recognize the incompatibility of passenger and freight rail.

The video discusses how the rise of American rail was as meteoric as it was chaotic, with companies expanding and merging without thinking about the consequences. The consolidation phase of the rail industry saw a shift away from efficiency and optimization, and towards wealth-generation through passenger service. However, by the end of the 20th century, the rise of the automobile and the truck made railroads increasingly uncompetitive.

The video discusses how, in the '60s, railroads were on the verge of collapse due to their heavy reliance on passenger routes. The government intervened by giving railroads a chance to break even by getting out of their way, and by 1970 Amtrak was created. However, since then, government regulations have choked railroads out, and as a result, passenger rail has failed to be profitable. Today, Amtrak trains are at the mercy of railroads' erratic, inconsistent, and inconsiderate scheduling.

The video discusses how the freight railroads were able to lower their rates far below what trucking could compete with by concentrating and enlarging the traffic on the rails. This simplified operations—the aggregation was already done for them, so ships dropped off ten or fifteen or twenty thousand containers at once, so all the railroads had to do was pick up a couple hundred of them and point east—it was hub to node, rather than node to node, so costs, like with coal, went down. As capacity was increasingly consumed by large-volume commodities and intermodal containers, there was no longer the need to serve the needs of more minor customers—the era of sending a locomotive to haul a couple cars from track-side factory to rail-yard was over. Volume ruled supreme, so railroads cut costs by closing smaller branch-lines to and from smaller towns—unless, of course, they had mines.

Today, not only are there more slow-moving freight trains to get stuck behind, but management's fixation on their all-important gross tonnage per train metric has meant that they've started running trains that are too long for their own infrastructure. Rail sidings are specifically built as stoppage points to let one train pass another

The video discusses Amtrak's poor performance and how the freight rail industry is to blame. The track priority law, which restricts freight rail from competing with Amtrak for passenger traffic, is the tiny law that keeps Amtrak TERRIBLE. If freight rail were allowed to compete more, Amtrak would be able to improve its performance and reduce its operating losses.
