This video discusses the various aspects of Florida that make it such a unique and strange state.

However, this popularity led to problems, such as the state's susceptibility to hurricanes and its water issues.

This project was successful in preventing Florida from becoming flooded and helped to create the state's modern-day landscape.

This video discusses how Florida became so weird, and how its developers had to build a different type of state in order to succeed.
