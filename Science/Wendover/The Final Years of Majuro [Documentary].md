The documentary "The Final Years of Majuro" reveals the struggle of the Marshall Islands to maintain economic growth due to the lack of export goods and a subsistence economy. The islands are also facing a cultural and physical displacement threat due to rising sea levels caused by climate change. Although this small nation only produces a tiny percentage of global emissions, a significant change from other countries is essential. The documentary also explores the settlement of the Marshallese community in Springdale, Arkansas, where they have established roots. However, they still face the possibility of losing their homes and cultural identity due to the threat of rising sea levels in their home country.
In the YouTube video, "The Final Years of Majuro [Documentary]", Marshall Islands residents express concerns about climate change and the impact of nuclear weapons testing on their homeland. Rising sea levels threaten to make their islands uninhabitable, potentially turning them into the world's first climate change refugees. The loss of their islands would mean losing their culture and way of life, which they are fighting to preserve. It is particularly painful for them as their nation might be killed by the ocean, turned against them by people who don't even know their name.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
In this section, the documentary introduces the Republic of the Marshall Islands, a small nation with a bit over 50,000 residents and only 70 square miles of land split up into 29 atolls encircling saltwater lagoons. Roughly 28,000 people live in Majuro, the capital atoll, and none of them live more than a few-minute walk from the ocean. However, the population density of Majuro is far from idyllic and urbanized with an average household size of seven and household income of about $16,000. The economy mostly depends on fish, coconuts, and people, which poses a problem since natural resources are scarce, and education and skills attainment challenges make businesses challenging.

In this section, the transcript explains how the Marshall Islands struggle to sustain economic growth due to the lack of viable export goods and a subsistence economy. However, their strategic location makes the Marshall Islands attractive to the US military, which contributes to the basis of the entire economic and political system of the Marshalls through the Compact of Free Association. Financial aid from the US accounts for upwards of 70-80% of the national income. In addition, the section details the formation of the Marshall Islands with the emergence of 29 rings of coral, called atolls, that make up the islands today and the arrival of the first Marshallese settlers 4,000 years ago.

00:10:00
In this section, the history of the Marshall Islands is discussed, including the arrival of Western explorers, the influence of Boston missionaries who banned traditional aspects of Marshallese culture and introduced Christianity, and the subsequent German and Japanese colonization. The section then focuses on the nuclear age and how the United States chose Bikini Atoll, located in the Marshall Islands, as a testing site for their nuclear weapons, which would have lasting effects on the island and its people.

00:15:00
In this section, we learn about the catastrophic consequences that nuclear testing had on the people of Rongelap and Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands. In 1954, the US detonated the Castle Bravo bomb, the most powerful explosion the world had ever seen, which produced nuclear fallout that covered the surrounding area, including Rongelap. The people of Rongelap were not evacuated for two days and suffered from radiation sickness, resulting in many of them falling victim to thyroid cancer. To this day, they have not been able to return home due to the area still being nuclear active. The people of Bikini Atoll were also not evacuated before testing began, and the inhabitants struggled with displacement and the loss of their land.

a matter of physical displacement, it’s a matter of cultural extinction. The Marshallese people have a deep spiritual and cultural connection to their land, and without it, their way of life and their very identity are at risk. Rising sea levels due to climate change are threatening to further erode their already precarious situation, making it all the more urgent for the international community to act on climate change and help the Marshallese people protect their homeland and their way of life.

00:25:00
In this section, we learn about the Marshall Islands and the Marshallese people's connection to their land, which is a fundamental tenet of their culture. Unfortunately, the islands are under threat from the looming threat of climate change caused by global emissions. Although the Marshall Islands only produce a tiny percentage of global emissions, only significant change from other countries can help save the islands. The magic number the Marshallese hope for is a limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, which will prevent their island home from becoming uninhabitable. However, before they could aim for this at this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, they needed to build influence and rallied support around the globe, beginning with building relationships with other countries at conferences worldwide. Finally, in 2014, a spark was lit when UN Climate Summit invited a Marshallese poet named Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner to speak at the opening ceremony of the event, where she read a letter written to her newborn daughter, representing the entire nation.

00:30:00
In this section, we see how Kathy Jetñil-Kijiner's poetry is a powerful tool for activism as it aids in personalizing an issue and connecting people to its emotional aspects. Later on, we see how Tony de Brum executes his plan of forming the High Ambition Coalition, which included over 90 countries, ranging from small atolls to the European Union, to turn the Paris Climate Conference on its head. This action demanded the inclusion of 1.5 in the agreement, which a majority of the represented nations supported before the conference ended. Finally, the resolution of the conference indicated that countries would hold the increase in global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius.

00:35:00
In this section of the transcript, the focus is on the Paris Agreement, which is described as both an enormous victory and a complete failure. The Agreement promised to limit temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. However, the pledges made were vague, unenforceable, and often ignored. Since the Paris Agreement, the situation has only gotten worse, with projections showing temperature increases of 1.5 degrees Celsius occurring as early as 2030. The Marshallese are already experiencing the effects of climate change through flooding, inundation, and the loss of farming land and vital resources. The most pressing effect of climate change on the Marshallese is the rise in climate-related diseases like dengue fever, which is expected to increase as climate effects worsen.

00:40:00
In this section, the transcript discusses the health issues currently faced in the Marshall Islands and their links to climate change. The rising temperatures have led to the spread of insect-borne diseases like Dengue and Zika, as well as contaminated water supplies, increasing the prevalence of diarrheal diseases. The section highlights that climate change-related diseases are predicted to cause over 2 million deaths in the next 20 years. The transcript goes on to explain that the Marshallese population has started to relocate to places like Springdale, Arkansas, a thriving, diverse city that is home to the largest population of Marshallese people outside of the Marshall Islands, estimated to be as many as 15,000.

In this section, the video explains how one man's decision to leave the Marshall Islands and work in a poultry plant in Muskogee, Oklahoma, led to the largest population of Marshallese outside of the islands themselves settling in Springdale, Arkansas. The city experienced a boom, giving everyone job opportunities, with Tyson Foods, one of the largest protein producers in the world, headquartered there. The consulate there, which shares a modest two-story building with other businesses, represents the Marshallese government and serves to provide consular services to Marshallese citizens, as well as "be the eyes and ears of the government of the Marshall Islands here." The video also explains the cultural barriers that Marshallese immigrants sometimes face upon arrival in Springdale.

00:50:00
In this section, the documentary explores the cultural differences between the Marshallese and Americans in terms of property ownership and economic values. In the Marshall Islands, property is often owned by clans, and multiple family members live together under one roof. Money is not as important in their culture as it is in the US, where people are economically driven. Despite this, the Marshallese have found a supportive community in Springdale, where they have access to many resources and services. However, due to the threat of rising sea levels in their home country, some Marshallese are forced to migrate and establish new lives elsewhere as they face the possibility of losing their homes and cultural identity.

00:55:00
In this section, the residents of the Marshall Islands discuss the impact of the seawall built to protect the village during high tides but also express concerns about the adverse effect of damaging the reef through building concrete walls. The goal is not to prevent the destruction of the Marshalls - just to delay it. Residents of the islands realize that the soil they stand on will eventually be submerged, making the Marshall Islands temporary, and the realization that their infrastructure projects may be swamped under water in 20, 30, or 40 years starts to hit hard. They believe they are the canary in the coal mine for climate change and survivors of the nuclear legacy and understand what it means to lose their connections to the land.

01:00:00
In this section of the video, residents of the Marshall Islands discuss the intersection between climate change and the nuclear legacy of testing nuclear weapons in their homeland. They express concern that they will become the world's first climate change refugees, as rising sea levels threaten to make their islands uninhabitable. The loss of the islands would mean the loss of their culture and way of life, which they are fighting to preserve. They acknowledge that nations have ended before, but the idea of their nation being killed by the ocean, turned against them by people who don't even know their name, is particularly painful.
