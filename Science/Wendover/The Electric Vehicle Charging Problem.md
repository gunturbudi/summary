# Summary of The Electric Vehicle Charging Problem

The biggest obstacle to mass-market adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is their charging problem, as studies show consumers want to charge their cars from empty to full in 31 minutes, which is not possible with current technology. The video explains that the challenge is in the infrastructure required to sell the cars, and without more widespread fast charging, adoption of EVs will be slow. This challenge is due to the way the electric grid works and the need for higher wattage power inverters to enable faster charging of EV batteries. In the US, the federal government has not incentivized fast-charger constructions, unlike in Europe, where governments have coordinated plans that include building charging stations. Therefore, while individual companies can make individual EVs attractive to consumers, the government must provide the infrastructure necessary to support EVs.

In this section, the video discusses how the largest barrier to mass-market adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is the charging problem. Studies show that consumers want to be able to charge their cars from empty to full in 31 minutes, which is not yet possible even with the upgraded and more expensive models of EVs from top manufacturers. In fact, widespread fast charging is difficult because of the way our electric grid works. The video explains how the price and range of EVs are almost at the tipping point for market dominance, but without widespread fast charging, the adoption of EVs will be slow.

In this section, the transcript discusses the problem with electric vehicle charging and the need for higher wattage power inverters to charge the batteries faster. While a standard iPhone charging inverter outputs 5 watts for an 11-watt hour battery, a base-model Tesla Model 3 has a 50-kilowatt hour battery that requires a 7.7 kW inverter to charge overnight but not as fast as a gasoline vehicle at an actual gas station. For charging high amounts of electricity faster, one needs a higher wattage inverter between 120 and 250 kW which can bypass the onboard inverter and charge the battery directly. While the cost of such an inverter is high, the industry doesn't need faster chargers but more chargers to overcome existing challenges.

In this section, it is highlighted that the challenge with electric vehicle (EV) charging is the infrastructure required to sell cars, but the inability to build that infrastructure, which results in a “chicken and the egg” problem. While Tesla’s Supercharging stations dominate the US, they use a proprietary plug, unlike most non-Tesla DC fast chargers with different types of plugs, which limits their universal usability. In contrast, Europe made the Combined Charging System (CCS) a standard for public DC fast chargers, predominantly enlarging DC fast charger density and coverage against the US, despite having a comparable number of EVs overall but double the DC fast charging stations.

In this section, we learn that one of the key problems with widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is the lack of infrastructure, specifically charging stations. Unlike Europe, where countries such as Germany have coordinated government plans that include the building of charging stations, the federal government in the US has done very little to incentivize fast-charger construction, and certainly does not have its own network. Although certain individual states in the US have implemented coordinated plans, this does not address the issue of gaps in infrastructure in states without such plans. The transcript argues that while individual companies can make individual electric vehicles attractive to consumers, the government must provide the infrastructure necessary to support EVs, just as it does for other essential systems like roads, bridges, and airports.
