# Summary of Why There are Now So Many Shortages (It's Not COVID)

The current shortages in supply chains are not directly caused by COVID-19 but rather it exposed vulnerabilities present in the system. Shortages of shipping containers, shipping capacity, port capacity and truck drivers have resulted in a vicious cycle that is worsening as economies reopen, leading to the shortage of bubble tea ingredients, construction supplies, and new cars. The principle of just-in-time manufacturing created by the Toyota Production System eliminated excess inventory and waste, improving production efficiency, but manufacturers globally misinterpreted the principle leading to less effective and resilient systems. The video suggests that the real cause of shortages is a ruthless pursuit of short-term profit at the expense of long-term gain, resulting in an over-reliance on just-in-time manufacturing. However, proper implementation of Toyota's system can make just-in-time manufacturing efficient and resilient.

In this section, the video discusses how COVID-19 is not the direct cause of the current shortages in supply chains, but rather it exposed vulnerabilities that have been present in the supply chain system. The shortage of boba ingredients in US shops is given as an example, which is attributed to a backlog of cargo ships sitting off the coast of Los Angeles waiting for spot at the ports. With more people shopping online, there has been an increase in imports, and although there is limited access to travel and other non-essential services, physical products became a means of spending discretionary income. The pandemic also caused dock-workers to be out sick, and shipping containers have been in short supply due to a regional shortage, exacerbating the issue.

In this section, the video explains how shortages are causing shortages, creating a vicious cycle that is worsening as economies reopen. The shortage of shipping containers has caused a shortage of shipping capacity, which is worsened by a shortage of port capacity and truck drivers, leading to a shortage of bubble tea ingredients. Scarcity is also affecting the construction industry, leading to skyrocketing lumber prices and shortages of chlorine due to a fire in a major plant. The rental car industry is also struggling due to a global shortage of new cars caused by manufacturers' reduction of component orders during the pandemic. With no new cars to purchase, rental car companies have to sell off much of their inventory, leaving tourists stranded in Alaska. Ironically, the very industry causing these shortages is the car industry, which created a system making such shortages possible.

In this section, the video discusses how the Toyota Production System created the principle of just-in-time manufacturing that eliminated excess inventory and waste, improving production efficiency. However, many manufacturers, globally, jumped on this principle without understanding what made it work for Toyota, leading to less effective and less resilient systems. The video highlights the importance of small physical size, short supply chains, production leveling, eliminating excess inventory versus all inventory, building teams of cross-functional workers, respecting people, and stopping and fixing problems in creating an effective manufacturing system.

In this section, the video explains that not all supply chains are made equal and that while plastic resin can handle supply chain disruption, semiconductors cannot, as their hugely expensive facilities are not easily substitutable, making their availability dependent on the smooth functioning of their factories. Toyota recognized this and built up a stockpile of two to six months worth of chips, allowing them to weather the semiconductor shortage while adhering to their principles. The video suggests that the real cause of shortages is a ruthless pursuit of short-term profit at the expense of long-term gain, resulting in an over-reliance on just-in-time manufacturing. The video concludes by saying that long-term thinking and proper implementation of Toyota's system can make just-in-time manufacturing efficient and resilient.
