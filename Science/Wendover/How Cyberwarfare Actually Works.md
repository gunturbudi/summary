The video titled "How Cyberwarfare Actually Works" explains how the Stuxnet virus was created, highlighting the role zero-day vulnerabilities played in its development. The code was reportedly crafted by a major world power or multiple, indicating sophisticated cyber warfare capabilities. The US and Israel are believed to have set an alarming pace for cyber offensives, leading to physical destruction, and escalating fears of catastrophic cyber warfare. The video also shares information on how to access educational content through Nebula and Curiosity Stream, which support independent content creators, at a lower cost than other streaming platforms.

In this section, we see how VirusBlokAda, a small Belarusian antivirus company, discovered that Iran was facing a malicious cyberattack. The virus led to the discovery of a new era of highly-advanced, highly-targeted, and highly-capable cyberwarfare, made possible by the zero-day vulnerability. While encryption used by tech giants made hacking difficult, the devices created by people still had holes, vulnerability. The part of the software without security was referred to as a zero-day. Early information security companies did not focus on buying zero-day vulnerabilities, but iDefense changed that by offering to pay for exploits in exchange for hackers' silence. In this way, ethical hackers had an opportunity to monetize their hobby, and iDefense had created a profitable and secure system.

In this section, the video explains how a thriving black and grey market still exists for zero-day exploitsâ€”especially for sales to countries with concerning human rights records. However, Western players like the US source zero-day exploits upon which they build their cyberweapons from companies that hardly hide what they're doing. Zerodium, a zero-day broker, even publishes its price list. Remote code execution exploits are the most desired zero-day exploits because they can allow virtually unfettered access to another's machine. Stuxnet was designed with several zero-day exploits, including a remote code execution exploit and two escalation-of-privilege zero-days, allowing it to gain access to an entire machine. This digital weapon was implemented at the Natanz nuclear facility in Iran, which had been air-gapped to protect its centrifuges from outside meddling. Therefore, a worm had to be planted manually by an unknowing employee, a spy, or a mole who plugged a contaminated USB stick into a PC running Microsoft Windows.

In this section, we learn about how cyber weapons consist of a carrier and a payload, and that Stuxnet used four zero-day vulnerabilities to effectively enter and spread through the Iranian nuclear plant's systems. The code's precision and complexity led cybersecurity experts to conclude that it was most likely crafted by a major world power or multiple, possibly as a third option between doing nothing and launching airstrikes against Iran's nuclear facilities. Additionally, Stuxnet's payload was designed to slowly destroy the centrifuges over time, indicating a more strategic and long-term approach to slowing down Iran's nuclear program. Despite evidence and speculation, no one has officially claimed responsibility for Stuxnet's creation.

In this section, the video discusses how the US and Israel have opened up a Pandora's box of state-led cyber offensives that have led to physical destruction after adopting cyber divisions, which were initially used for defense and surveillance. The two countries are believed to have set the pace for many other nations to close the cyberweapon gap by going on the offensive. The leaked American NSA's hacking tools in 2017 accelerated cyberwarfare's capabilities, thus changing the landscape of future conflicts. The experts believe that a catastrophic cyberwarfare capability exists more acutely today than at any point before. Traditional weapons have consequences for aggressors, but cyberweapons do not. They have the potential for destruction without consequences in this new battlefield where there are no rules of engagement or Geneva conventions.
