The Nuclear Waste Problem is a YouTube video that discusses the difficulties of storing nuclear waste. It is difficult to store nuclear waste safely because it is radioactive and will emit radiation for millions of years. The video discusses the Finnish site that is designed to be difficult to access and release radiation into the environment.

Detail Summary:

Nuclear energy is one of the cleanest, most efficient, and most available sources of power on earth. However, nuclear waste is a major problem, and is currently stored in pools of water or in concrete and steel containers that don't always work as expected.

The nuclear waste problem concerns the long-term storage of radioactive materials, specifically nuclear waste. Humans have only existed for a short time compared to the millions of years that the most toxic nuclear waste will emit radiation. The Nuclear Waste Problem discusses the difficulties of communicating the danger of nuclear waste to future civilizations. The idea is to build a landscape that conveys danger, such as a scene of thorns or spikes. However, this is difficult to do and may not be humans exploring earth 100,000 years from now. The Finnish site is designed to be difficult to access and release radiation into the environment, removing the need for human management. There is a reasonable hope that one of the world's languages will survive for hundreds of thousands of years, but there is little expectation that humans will survive.

Brilliant offers an interactive course on solar energy, and as a viewer of Wendover Productions, I recommend giving it a try.
