Embassies are essential in the field of international relations and act as vessels for diplomacy. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations sets out laws that govern how embassies operate, including the inviolability of embassy premises and diplomatic immunity for diplomats. Ambassadors, who head embassies, have a wide-ranging job, helping their country build and maintain relationships politically and economically. Embassies also represent their home countries through their building, which needs to be impressive. The video shows examples of impressive embassy buildings around the world, including the US embassy in Baghdad, which is entirely self-sufficient due to security threats. Diplomats serving in foreign service are compensated based on factors like the climate, healthcare, pollution, and danger of a place. Despite questions about embassies' purpose in the modern age, ambassadors remain crucial in representing their countries politically and to the public.

In this section, we learn about how embassies are the vessels through which diplomacy is conducted and they are crucial in the field of international relations. The size of an embassy may vary according to the country and could be as big as the US embassy in Baghdad, which was as large as Vatican City and had reached a peak of 16,000 staff during the Iraq War. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations sets out a number of laws that govern how embassies work. One of the most significant laws is Article 22 which states that the premises of the mission shall be inviolable, meaning that any representative of the host countryâ€™s government, including police officers and government officials, cannot enter the embassy unless invited by the ambassador or their government. The diplomats and the embassy are exempt from all taxes in the host country, and diplomats are granted diplomatic immunity. However, embassy buildings are not the sovereign territory of the country they represent and local laws still apply there.

In this section, the video discusses the role of embassies in promoting diplomacy and soft power. Embassies are typically headed by ambassadors, whose job varies widely from person to person and post to post. Ambassadors help their country build and maintain relationships with those who can help them politically or economically. In addition, embassies also represent their homeland through their actual building, which needs to look the part. The video also looks at some of the most impressive and important embassy buildings, including the Chinese embassy building in Washington D.C. and the embassy building of the United Arab Emirates. During wars, embassies play a critical role, and the video looks at how the US embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, was built to be entirely self-sufficient due to the security threat.

In this section of the video, it is explained how the US embassy in Baghdad operates, and how diplomats serving in foreign service are compensated. The embassy in Baghdad has its own area codes, fortified apartments, and luxurious amenities like a swimming pool, tennis courts, a fitness center, and a helicopter pad. Diplomats serving in foreign service also receive more money the harder it is to live in a particular place, with a bonus ranging from 5% to 35%, depending on factors such as the climate, healthcare, pollution, and overall danger of a place. Even places that are popular tourist destinations, like Ponta Delgada in Portugal, can receive hardship pay if they are extremely isolated. Despite the question of embassies' purpose in the modern age, ambassadors remain an essential aspect of representing their countries, both politically and to the public, which is more important now than ever.
