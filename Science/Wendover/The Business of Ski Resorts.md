The video discusses the business of ski resorts and how they rely on public transportation to get workers and guests to and from the ski hills. It explains that most ski resorts don't actually own the land they operate on, but instead only hold permits to use it. This means that anyone can use the land, which can be a problem when the weather isn't good. There is also a cost to snowmaking, which can be expensive. Recently, the ski industry has seen consolidation as smaller resorts have tried to compete with the larger resorts.
