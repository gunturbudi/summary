In this section, we learn about how the President of the United States starts his day, beginning with breakfast and reading the daily curated "bulletin" of news stories. The President then does a workout with his trainer before attending the crucial Daily Briefing meeting, where he is informed of important information by the intelligence agencies. The President then meets with the Chief of Staff, who coordinates all operations of the White House. Later, the President deals with a minor crisis involving the Architect of the Capitol, an agency responsible for the Capitol complex. However, the specifics of how the President makes decisions are not publicly recorded. Mondays are typically used for internal policy and planning work, which is not made known to the public for some time.

In this section, we get a glimpse into the daily life of two US presidents, George W. Bush and Joe Biden. The most detailed information we have on a president's daily schedule comes from the Bush administration due to a five-year restriction on presidential records from the Freedom of Information Act. Biden's week is described as largely uneventful, with a firing of the Architect of the Capitol and a call to inform a Vietnam War hero they will receive the Medal of Honor. The section then delves into the management of press access to the White House, with a focus on the press pool and the practical limitations of space and time. Tuesday is described as slightly busier, with the President making announcements about Air India's purchase of Boeing aircraft and a negative inflation report. The press pool is detailed as a group of 13 journalists who take turns following the President's activities closely, producing pool reports and providing content for various news organizations.

In this section, we see how the travel pool and seating arrangements work during briefings, as well as a summary of President Biden's activities during the week, culminating in a surprise unannounced trip to a conflict zone. The article explains how the seating arrangements at briefings act as a ranking of media organizations and the significance of the pool seating chart. We also learn about the surprise trip the Bidens made to a conflict zone, with an unusually small peripheral team of journalists and cell phones surrendered upon arrival.

In this section, we learn about the cloak-and-dagger planning that went into President Biden's secret trip to Ukraine. A C-32 plane was used for its relative anonymity, and the president and his team flew without any direct American air support, vehicles, or troops providing security. They traveled secretly via a renovated luxury tourist train to get to Kyiv, where they engaged in some public events before heading back on the train towards the border. The trip was deemed extremely dangerous and risky, with American intelligence navigating a minefield of uncontrollable variables and pushing for safer alternatives. The White House communicated the trip to Russia ahead of time, and three separate American surveillance aircraft tightly looped overhead as the President crossed the border.
