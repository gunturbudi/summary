# Summary of Cities at Sea: How Aircraft Carriers Work

Aircraft carriers are massive ships used by nations to project their military might. They are typically armed and defended, making them difficult targets. While they are very powerful, they are not invincible, as evidenced by two recent incidents. Despite this, aircraft carriers are not going anywhere, with multiple nations currently constructing them.

Detail Summary:

Aircraft carriers are massive ships that can dramatically change the level of a nation's military might. They are able to position themselves up to 22 kilometers from any country's coast and can launch fixed-wing airplanes. They are fully fledged cities at sea and require over 6,000 people to operate. Despite their enormous capabilities, aircraft carriers are targets and rarely travel alone. They rely on a fleet of cargo aircraft, typically C-2 Greyhounds, to connect them to shore.

An aircraft carrier is a large, floating vessel that is used to transport planes to and from combat zones. Aircraft carriers are typically very fast and can reach places that land-based military bases cannot. They are also heavily armed and defended, making them a formidable target.

An aircraft carrier is a large ship that is used to carry and support aircraft. Aircraft carriers are often used in war games to practice combat scenarios. Two incidents in 2005 and 2015 where Swedish and French submarines "won" the games against US carriers suggest that aircraft carriers are not as unsinkable as some may say. The US has already received the first of ten new class of carriers and China, India, and the UK each have carriers under construction, so the aircraft carrier will not be leaving the world's oceans any time soon.
