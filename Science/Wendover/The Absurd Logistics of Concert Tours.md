The logistics of a concert tour are complex and require a lot of advance planning. Riders include requests for accommodations, food, parking, and more, and must be updated as the tour progresses. The first people on-site are the tour's leadership, who conduct a walk-through with the venue's management and plan the day's activities. The crew then works their way through the backstage, marking day sheets that detail key moments throughout the day. Setup for the concert begins with rigging, which involves hanging chains and other hardware in precise points from grids of beams in the roof. Stage placement is decided early in the tour, and usually depends on the size and type of arena the concert is taking place in.

With a typical arena tour requiring dozens of rigging points, precision and safety are crucial. On a typical tour, the crew assembles lighting and audio trusses, and sets up the stage. Near the end of the tour, the crew prepares for the concert by switching on the pre-show lighting and mic-ing up the artists. After the concert, the crew prepares for the next show by cleaning and packing up the equipment.
