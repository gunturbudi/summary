# Summary of How to Illegally Cross the Mexico-US Border

Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=DTIDCA7mjZs

The video explores the reasons behind illegal border crossing between Mexico and the US, with economic disparity and family reunification or escape from violence being the primary driving factors. Individuals who cannot migrate legally turn to the faster yet much more dangerous option of illegally crossing, often with a smuggler's help. The options for illegally crossing include exploiting gaps in the wall, which increases the risk of death or injury due to the desolate areas that smugglers and migrants are pushed towards. While some initiatives by the US Customs and Border Protection Agency and humanitarian groups have addressed the issue of the high death toll in the area, the root cause of illegal immigration is the lack of reasonable, legal paths to migrate to the US. The video argues that social systems such as a "real" immigration system that provides opportunities to all are needed to cut down on illegal immigration.

In this section, the video discusses the significance of the Mexico-US border, which separates two of the most economically and socially interlinked countries in the world. While there are 50 spots where one can legally cross the border by land, the rest of the 1,954 mile line is secured and individuals need to go through immigration checkpoints to do it legally. However, each year, hundreds of thousands to millions of people attempt to cross into the US illegally from Mexico. This is primarily driven by the large economic disparities between the two countries, where the average income in the US is $65,000 per year compared to $9,500 per year in Mexico. Additionally, family reunification or escape from violence are other common reasons for migration. However, many individuals cannot migrate legally due to a lack of legitimate or practical routes. This leads people to choose the faster, yet riskier option of crossing the border illegally, often with a smuggler's help.

In this section, we learn about the options that migrants have when it comes to illegally crossing the US-Mexico border. They can hire smugglers who charge a fee of around $3,500 per person to group them together and transport them to the border. Smugglers and migrants generally have two options when faced with obstacles: border security or nature. While the majority of the third of the border that is secured takes the form of a vehicle barrier, there are still many gaps in the wall that smugglers can exploit. As a result of increased security around populated areas, migrants are pushed to more remote and desolate areas where the chances of injury or death are higher. This shows that making border crossings difficult only helps the largest cartels make more money and puts the lives of migrants at risk.

In this section, the video discusses the issues and interventions surrounding illegal immigration across the Mexico-US border, including initiatives by the US Customs and Border Protection Agency and various humanitarian groups to address the staggering death toll in the area due to dehydration, hypothermia, and other injuries. While securing the border may curb illegal immigration to some extent, the root cause of illegal immigration is the lack of a reasonable, legal path to migrate to the US. The video argues that illegal immigration is caused by push factors, and social systems such as a "real" immigration system that provides opportunities to all are needed to cut down on it.
