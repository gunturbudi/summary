In this section, the video explains the different population densities between American and European cities, highlighting that Paris has a higher population density than New York City. The video delves into the reasons for this disparity, with one explanation being the age of the cities. The fact that European cities existed for longer periods than most American cities meant that walking distance was critical, and the wealthy paid more for houses in the city center. In contrast, American cities had more advanced decentralizing technologies by the time they grew too large for walking distance. The video further breaks down the evolution of transportation modes in America, including the impact of railroads, streetcars, and automobiles on the geography of American cities.

In this section, the reasons behind European cities' lack of suburbanization are examined, including Germany's decision to rebuild its cities after WWII in a compact design. Additionally, high crime rates in the 70s, 80s, and 90s, with violent crime rates still remaining consistently higher in the US, led to a suburbanization boom in the US based on safety concerns. However, suburban life did not meet expectations and is now linked to higher blood pressure, lower frustration tolerance and anxiety. Cost of living and fuel costs in Europe also incentivize city living, which is having a second renaissance among rich Americans due to a lower crime rate and an overall shift in attitudes.
