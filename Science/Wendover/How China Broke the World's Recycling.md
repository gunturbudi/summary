China's decision to ban the import of certain polypropylene plastics created a global recycling crisis, as the country's processors could no longer turn a profit from sorting and processing the waste. The video explains that while the recycling of plastic is theoretically profitable, in practice it is not due to the environmental and public health problems it creates. The solution is to make recycling more profitable by changing consumer behavior.

Detail Summary:

The global recycling system was changed by a document titled a Notification to the World Trade Organization Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade. The notification broke the world's recycling system by introducing a new category of recyclable material, MRF Residuals, which are not valuable enough to pay for the sorting process.

The video discusses how China's plastics industry grew rapidly, but eventually became unsustainable because recycled plastic wasn't profitable. The industry needed a solution, and they found it in the perception of sustainability. However, the perception of sustainability was only possible because of the three economic conditions mentioned in the video- cheap shipping rates, high raw material prices, and low wages. When these conditions stopped being present, recycling became unprofitable, and the plastic waste from across the world started piling up in Hong Kong.

The video discusses how China broke the world's recycling system by making it unprofitable. With few buyers and high waste piles, the processors eventually gave up and dumped the waste into the same category as bottle caps, scraps, and small, unrecoverable pieces of plastic. Now, when recycling is done, it ends up in the incinerator or landfill. The true solution is to make recycling more profitable, and this will take a lot of change. If enough consumers buy products that use recycled plastic, the industry will eventually get the message and the cost of recycled plastic will go up.
