# Summary of How Corporate Consolidation is Killing Ski Towns

Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=S46iJIk3t70

The consolidation of the ski industry has had a significant impact on small ski towns, as ski resort companies have squeezed them in a bid to increase profits. Vail Resorts' Epic Pass serves as an example, as it has enabled the company to acquire smaller resorts, making them available on a single pass. By owning and operating everything from hotels and restaurants to rental shops and real estate brokerages, Vail and Alterra are competing against local businesses and eliminating opportunities for local success. The situation has resulted in the financial impossibility of minimum-wage work, with housing costs being too high for employees to find affordable accommodation. While the industry has created jobs, nature and income in small ski towns, it has not made them affordable for the locals.

In this section, the history of North American ski towns is discussed, with many of them having been boomtowns gone bust or resource towns on the verge of collapse until skiing offered them a lifeline. The ski resorts were not what gutted communities initially but rather what kept them alive. However, as ski resort companies looked to corner the highest yield customers and added more terrain, more snow-making, and more infrastructure, they began squeezing ski towns. The business model worked until it suddenly didn't, with skier numbers plateauing, and warm, dry weather partly to blame.

In this section, we learn how Vail Resorts completely transformed the ski industry by decoupling the company from the physical ski resort and acquiring smaller resorts, some of them tiny, some world class, but all of them now available on a single season pass. Vail launched the Epic Pass in 2008, breaking the record of flattening numbers and scooping up the market of the 10 to 20 day a year skier of varying age, economic standing, and location. Vail Resorts' Epic Pass not only created a new and loyal customer base that didn't sit on the sidelines priced out but also reinvigorated skiing as a sport.

In this section, the video explains how corporate consolidation in the ski industry has led to the vertical integration of the visitor experience, where Vail and Alterra own and operate everything from hotels and restaurants to rental shops and real estate brokerages. By incentivizing visitors to stay within the system and offering discounts to passholders, Vail is competing against local businesses and eliminating opportunities for local success to be tied to their success. This has resulted in a financial impossibility of minimum-wage work in the Vail Valley, despite the conglomerate's new minimum wage of $20 an hour. Housing costs are also high, making it difficult for employees to find affordable accommodation in the town where they work.

In this section, the issue of corporate consolidation in ski towns is explored, with Vail Resorts serving as an example. Vail Resorts acts as both employer and landlord with their employee housing program, filling tiny, dorm-style accommodations that often don’t accommodate all workers. The resort attracts financially flexible young people willing to work long hours on the slopes for minimal wage, and these workers don’t integrate into the community, as they leave once the season is over. Vail Resorts' money doesn’t stay in the Vail valley, primarily goes to a transient, short-term labor pool, which is gone come spring, leaving the resort with only low-paying jobs outside of mountain operations, hospitality, and retail. The story of Crested Butte's loss of affordability and their local workforce being pushed down-valley while costs skyrockets is also highlighted.

In this section, the video discusses the devil’s bargain that small ski towns have faced due to the consolidation of the industry, where they have jobs, nature and income, but no affordable access to their own towns. This ultimately leads to the destruction of the towns themselves as they become too expensive for locals to live in. Though outside forces may not have created this tragic trade-off, their influence made the decisions for these communities. Small, delicate towns were forced into the third option where they would have jobs and nature but no longer have affordable access to their own towns. The vulnerability of these towns to outside actions and the inevitable step of their perpetual evolution has made their survival uncertain. The video also announced Nebula's brand-new original series, Logistics of X, that delves deeper into the logistics of topics that Wendover videos explore, where creators are able to do stuff they can’t on YouTube, such as making huge, ambitious dream projects with bigger budgets, and releasing videos ad and sponsorship free.
