# Summary of Why California Has So Many Problems

Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=1ngms6iRa14

The video "Why California Has So Many Problems" explores the unique geography and history of California, which contribute to its isolation from the rest of the US. While the state is incredibly wealthy and home to Silicon Valley, it also faces a homelessness crisis and a housing shortage, as the high cost of living makes it difficult to find affordable shelter. Local government and anti-density proponents hinder efforts to solve these issues, and proposals for secession or partition have gained surprising levels of legitimacy. The video concludes by asking whether California's problems can be solved with unexceptional solutions, or if its uniqueness requires something new.

Detail Summary:

In this section, it is explained that California's geography and history make it a uniquely isolated state which was granted statehood by ocean in 1850, initially operating more like a colony with limited connection to the rest of America. With towering mountains and deserts separating it from the east, California never had oil pipelines and instead imported oil from foreign countries, refining it locally. The state also has a unique agricultural inspection system and is the only state that requires border inspections for invasive species, demonstrating its natural disconnect. However, the state is incredibly wealthy with Silicon Valley contributing to its impressive GDP. Its largest cities function like dozens of smaller cities and towns, leaving few overarching bodies to align incentives which has created unique problems in infrastructure and governance.

In this section, the video discusses California's homelessness problem and the difficulty in finding housing. California has nearly 30% of the nation's total homeless population and 44 people experiencing homelessness per 10,000, which is higher than any other state. Although providing stable shelters and housing programs is associated with lowering numbers, California has comparatively little in the way of shelter beds, prioritizing permanent housing projects instead. Furthermore, the state is in the middle of a housing crisis because of high cost of living, not because of a faltering economy or meager wages. The state's economy is too strong for its own good, and the high jobs-housing ratio contributes to the housing crisis. Additionally, the California Dream of owning a single-family home with a lawn and a pool is causing massive problems, as residents are willing to fight for it, making it difficult to rezone and build apartments.

In this section, the transcript discusses how local governments and anti-density proponents are hindering California's efforts to solve issues of housing and homelessness. Powerful public figures and organizations have resisted minor zoning changes and small housing projects, forcing state legislators to launch large-scale projects such as motel-to-housing conversion and back anti-NIMBY laws. Additionally, there are fires, water disputes, and aging infrastructure, leading to an untenable level of problems. The transcript suggests that California should become a country as it ranks well above average on all major metrics of scale, receives less federal spending than it gives and lacks representation in the Senate and electoral college.

In this section, the possibility of California secession or partition is discussed. While secession is unlikely due to the dire economic consequences it would have, the idea of partition has gained surprising levels of legitimacy, with proposals to split the state into three parts being put forward over two hundred times. This idea argues that the state government is out of touch with local governments and that the Federal government is out of touch with the state government, so reducing the size of the state could balance population, wealth, and politics. However, even if such a split was approved by the state, it would then be up to the Federal government to approve it, which is highly unlikely due to the potential ramifications and precedent of establishing such a split.

In this section, the video discusses how California's uniqueness as a state has led to a belief in Californian exceptionalism, where the state requires unique solutions. The state's fundamental differences to the rest of the nation have permeated through Sacramento, leading to decisions being made without precedent. This is further complicated by the belief in American exceptionalism, where there is a systematic rejection of solutions that have worked in other cultural equivalents, out of a belief that they are incompatible with what makes America unique. Despite this, it is difficult to objectively analyze whether Californian politics are terrible or if liberal politics are structurally flawed. Ultimately, the problem of how to solve California's problems is also how to solve America's problems - should it keep trying to find something new, or can unexceptional solutions work for unexceptional problems, despite being in exceptional places?
