The US Military has a massive global transportation system that includes ships to supply deployed navy forces and cargo ships that provide food and supplies to the US. In the event that more vessels are needed, Sealift Command will activate the 40-plus Ready Reserve Force, consisting of old, government-owned ships that are sitting inactive across American ports. The US Military also has the Merchant Marine, a fleet of American flagged, private merchant ships that serve as auxiliary cargo-and-people-moving resources along commercial trade routes for the Navy during peacetime and war. Despite the challenges of the system, the US Military is commonly and objectively recognized as the world's greatest fighting force.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
The US Department of Defense employs nearly three million people around the world, and its global transportation system is unique in that it uses a rotating cast of airlines and ocean vessels to move personnel and cargo. BWI airport is the hub of the system, and a flight leaves every night for Thule Air Base, Ramstein Air Base, Incirlik Air Base, Kuwait International Airport, or Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar. Passengers can add their name to a list to get a seat on the free flight, and the priority system is used to rank house hunting trips as more important than the travel of retired but Space-A-eligible veterans. The Patriot Express system lowers the relative distance between American military bases and the mainland United States and vice versa.

The military's massive global transportation system is primarily composed of commercial cargo airlines and the Civil Reserve Air Fleet. When needed, the military leans on these two systems to move soldiers and supplies around the world. The Defense Transportation System is designed to be able to rapidly assemble an air base when needed.

The military relies on a variety of transportation systems to project power and support operations. Air Force Advanced Bases, Army Prepositioned Stocks, and Navy Maritime Prepositioning Ships are all examples of how the military prepares for transport constraints on the day a war breaks out.
