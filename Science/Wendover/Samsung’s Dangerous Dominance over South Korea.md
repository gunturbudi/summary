Samsung is a company that originated in South Korea and has since become one of the most dominant conglomerates in the world. Its success can largely be attributed to the government's support of the conglomerates during the post-war period, and its growth is now threatening to destabilize the country's economy.

The article discusses how Samsung, one of South Korea's largest chaebols, has had a significant impact on the nation's economy and society. The chaebol has aided in raising life expectancy, decreasing infant mortality, and increasing GDP, among other accomplishments. Though the chaebol has had some negative effects, such as the increased concentration of wealth and the focus on the "Samsung man" syndrome, it has overall been a positive force in South Korea. The article discusses how Samsung's control of multiple affiliates allows the chaebol to make decisions with a simple majority, which is advantageous to the family's control.

The video discusses the complicated ownership structure of Samsung, which can result in the family losing control of the company if one of their members dies. In order to keep control, the Lee family proposed a merger between two of their affiliates, which would inflate the value of one of them. They needed the approval of C&T shareholders, who were opposed by American hedge fund Elliot. President Park was potentially able to veto the deal if she knew about it, and so the Lee family had to keep her informed. Choi Soon-sil, who was not an official government employee but had a great deal of influence over President Park, was used as a back-door to influence her.
