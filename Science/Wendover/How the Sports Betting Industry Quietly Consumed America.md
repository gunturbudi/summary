The sports betting industry has quietly consumed America over the past decade or so. The 2006 Safe Port Act, which prohibited gambling companies from taking payments over the internet, opened up a loophole that allowed fantasy sports to be classified as a game of scale, not chance. This distinction made sense at the time, as fantasy sports were fundamentally different from any form of online gambling. However, in 2009, FanDuel, a fantasy sports platform, emerged as a major player in the market, thanks to the Act's exemption for fantasy sports. In 2013, FanDuel partnered with the NBA, and its competitors, DraftKings and MLB/NHL, entered partnerships with gambling companies adjacent to their fantasy platforms. This shift in conversations from sports betting as a scourge to sports betting as a potential opportunity has led to more fan engagement and better gameplay at the same time that sports leagues have been voting with their wallets by spending billions of dollars on wagers annually.
The sports betting industry quietly consumed America in 2018, when eight states legalized sports betting. In 2019, 10 more states followed suit, and by 2022, 30 US states had some form of legal sports betting. The industry spent heavily to secure legalization in the friendliest terms possible, and by 2021, sports betting revenue had tripled
