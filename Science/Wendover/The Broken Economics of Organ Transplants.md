# Summary of The Broken Economics of Organ Transplants

This video explores the challenges of allocating organs fairly in the US, a country where thousands of people wait years for transplants due to a scarcity of organs. Without a good way of allocating organs, choices are made between either extreme quality of life or no life at all. The system in the US ranks patients based on how much they can use the organ, which creates problems because wealthier patients are better able to afford organs, perpetuating inequality. Although a market-based economy for organ allocation, like the one implemented in Iran, has been successful in reducing waiting lists, there are concerns regarding inequality and incentivizing individuals to sell organs. Ultimately, economics must be used thoughtfully in situations that involve life and death.

In this section, the video discusses how the scarcity of organs has created an economic system that struggles to allocate them fairly. With over 112,000 people on organ transplant lists in the US alone and only 39,718 transplants being performed in 2019, patients can wait years for a new organ. While each country's transplant list works differently, in the US, an individual's position on the list is based on how much use they can get from the organ. This means that priority is given to those with the most urgent need and those who will live the longest with the organ. However, this system faces significant challenges due to the infinite willingness to pay for a scarce resource, which perpetuates inequality as wealthier patients are better able to afford organs.

In this section, the complexities of the organ transplant system in the US are discussed. Patients are ranked based on their EPTS score, which takes into account their probability of surviving ten years post-transplant. Kidney transplant allocation is determined by factors such as geography, compatibility, and necessity, and the US is split into eleven regions that are not created equal in terms of waiting times due to differences in the population of donors. This system of non-monetary allocation is designed to match kidneys based on need and reduce inequality, but it does not have a mechanism to address the issue of scarcity. Additionally, wealthier people are able to list themselves in multiple regions due to geographic disparities, perpetuating inequality in the system.

In this section, it is discussed whether a traditional market economy can be used for organ allocation, similar to what has been implemented in Iran. While the program had some success at eliminating waiting lists, it is not a truly free market and opponents argue that it exacerbates inequality and incentivizes small earners to sell their organs while pricing out poorer individuals who need transplants. Ultimately, there is no perfect solution, but economics must be used carefully in situations where life and death are at stake.
