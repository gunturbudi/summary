# Summary of Why Planes Don't Fly Faster

This video explains how planes fly slower than they did in the past due to advances in aircraft engines. Turbojet engines are more efficient but require more fuel. The bypass ratio is important in determining engine efficiency. The Concorde was a supersonic jet that used 10:1 bypass ratio GE engines. Its fuel consumption was significantly higher than that of the GEnx, CFM56, or even the JT8D.

The video discusses how planes fly slower than they did in the past due to advances in aircraft engines. Turboprop and turbofan engines are inefficient at high speeds and are therefore only used on smaller commuter planes. Turbojet engines are more efficient but require more fuel. The bypass ratio is important in determining engine efficiency. The bypass ratio on the General Electric GEnx engine is 10:1, which is much more efficient than the CFM International CFM56 engine with a bypass ratio of 5.9:1.

The Concorde was a supersonic jet that used 10:1 bypass ratio GE engines. Its fuel consumption was significantly higher than that of the GEnx, CFM56, or even the JT8D. After it stopped flying in 2003, first class on other planes looked like this, and the seats went fully flat into a bed. However, the cost of the airplane per flight was barely over $5,000, while the fuel cost for a flight from New York to London was well over $15,000, and airlines always just fly their airplanes at the most fuel efficient speed.

This video explains how planes don't fly faster because time is the enemy of the privileged few, cost is the enemy of the masses. By listening to audiobooks, people can turn what would be an otherwise boring task into something fun. In particular, the author recommends listening to Skyfaring, a book about 747 pilot Mark Vanhoenacker.
