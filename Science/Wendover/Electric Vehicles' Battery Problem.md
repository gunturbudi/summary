This video discusses the potential problems with electric vehicles' reliance on lithium batteries. The batteries are not yet cost-competitive, and the environmental and social problems associated with them could be lessened.

Detail Summary:

The lithium industry is growing rapidly, with electric vehicles being a major part of the boom. However, the world's solution to supplying the necessary lithium is facing challenges, with the biggest being the lack of available land in dry, sparsely populated areas. The US is looking to take advantage of a major lithium deposit in Nevada, but the project has been difficult to execute.

This video discusses the potential environmental and social problems that could arise if the proposed Thacker Pass lithium mine goes into operation. The mine would require a large amount of water, and there is a trade-off between using water for mining and other purposes. The mine also poses a danger to wildlife and indigenous people due to its location and the lack of safety standards in the cobalt mining industry. If batteries become more efficient, the need for lithium could be reduced, and the environmental and social problems associated with it could be lessened.

Solid state batteries have many advantages over lithium ion batteries, including a higher safety profile and the elimination of two problematic elements. They also have higher energy density, meaning they could hold more energy and reduce the weight of a battery pack in an electric vehicle. However, the transition to solid state batteries is not yet cost-competitive, and it will likely be some time before they reach that point. Meanwhile, developments in niche applications such as medical devices, race cars, and fighter jets are leading the way to scale.

Electric vehicles face a potential battery problem, as the technology to create and store electric batteries has not kept up with the rate of technological advancement. This problem arises from the fact that electric vehicles are designed to run on a continuous flow of electricity, which must be generated by a battery. However, the batteries in electric vehicles are not designed to last as long as the vehicles themselves do. This means that the vehicles will need to be replaced more frequently, which will damage the environment. To prevent this damage, electric vehicles must be extended the same care and consideration as other types of vehicles when it comes to the environment.
