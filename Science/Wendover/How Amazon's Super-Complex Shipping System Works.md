# Summary of How Amazon's Super-Complex Shipping System Works

Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=2qanMpnYsjk

Amazon has a complex shipping system that relies on robots, automated machines, and human pickers to sort and package items for delivery. The company tries to predict demand for items in different parts of the country and uses this information to pack products into smaller, lower-cost packages. This system is more efficient than UPS or FedEx because it uses fewer planes and trucks and delivers packages directly to the post office.

This 1-minute video explains how Amazon's complex shipping system works. Amazon has three fulfillment categories - small, large, and large non-sortable - based on the size and weight of the item. For smaller items, Amazon uses robots and automated machines to reduce the need for human labor, and for larger items, Amazon relies on human pickers.

Amazon's shipping system is complex, but it works well. Large items, like a 70-pound beanbag, are shipped from large non-sortable fulfillment centers, which include workers who create custom boxes for odd-sized items. In Colorado, for example, this is a completely separate facility from the sortable fulfillment center in Thornton. The portion of large non-sortable items not sent to a third party logistics provider, plus all the large and small sortable packages would next be sent to a regional sortation center. In Colorado, those two fulfillment centers send their packages to a single sortation center, located just minutes away from the Aurora fulfillment center. This is a massive facility, almost half a million square feet in size, with robots running around, dropping packages into different chutes, which each represent a different grouping of zip codes. Now, not all the sortation centers are quite so automated, but each outputs the same thingâ€”pallets of packages going to roughly the same place. What happens next, though, once again, depends. A package heading to Miami, for example, would end up on a pallet with other packages for Miami, which itself would end up on a truck carrying pallets for Tampa, North Carolina, Houston, Baltimore

Amazon's super-complex shipping system works by flying packages to three different destinations in Florida, then delivering them by truck to more rural areas. This system is more efficient than UPS or FedEx because it uses fewer planes and trucks and delivers packages directly to the post office.

Amazon's super-complex shipping system works by using a variety of routes and delivery methods to get packages to their final destination as quickly and cheaply as possible. While other companies are trying to catch up to Amazon's capabilities, the company still has competitors. For businesses, Amazon's innovative logistics system is a major threat.
