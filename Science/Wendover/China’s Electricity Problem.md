China is struggling with its electricity consumption, as the country gets hotter and its people get wealthier. Coal is a major contributor to the problem, as China relies heavily on it for electricity generation. However, renewables are becoming increasingly cost-competitive with coal, and China's biggest challenges lie in transferring electricity over vast distances and incentivizing renewables.

Detail Summary:

China is having a problem with its electricity consumption; the country's getting hotter, and its getting wealthier, which is leading to difficulties like power outages and gridlock. China's reliance on coal for electricity generation is a major contributor to the issue.

China is reliant on coal for its power, but the cost of this fuel is more distributed over the lifetime of use, meaning that more money is coming in rather than spending upfront to add capacity. This reality has undergirded the centrality of coal in China's energy mix. However, renewables are increasingly becoming cost-competitive with coal, and China's biggest challenges lie in transferring electricity over vast distances and incentivizing renewables.

China's electricity problem is that while the nation is theoretically flexible, interconnected, and national, in practice its grid is still very regional, rudimentary, and coal-oriented. In 2021, when the country faced an 11% increase in coal demand from the year prior, and an 8% increase from 2019, it banned Australian coal to mitigate its losses. While the crisis passed, the underlying problems with the grid were exposed, leading to concerns about China's ability to continue its meteoric growth.

China has set ambitious goals for reducing its carbon emissions, but admits that it may not be able to hit them by 2030. In order to try and meet its 2030 goals, the country has begun construction of a large number of coal-fired power plants. However, due to the country's economic problems, these plants may not be economically feasible. Additionally, Beijing has begun to focus more on energy security in its transition towards renewables.
