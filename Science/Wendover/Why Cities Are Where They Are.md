# Summary of Why Cities Are Where They Are

The video explains that cities are located where they are due to a combination of factors. One of the most significant is water, particularly oceans and rivers, as they provide economic efficiency for the transportation of goods. Further, natural resources like Pittsburgh's steel industry can also attract cities. Additionally, the video explores human factors that influence city location and how Apple stores and Starbucks use population density to determine store locations. It also discusses why civilizations succeeded in some places and failed in others, noting that Europe and Asia succeeded due to their wider, rather than taller, landscapes.

In this section, the video explores the ten-mile rule and how it influenced the location of small agricultural towns before cars were invented. Assuming each town had the same services, people would go to the closest town to buy or sell goods, thus making ten miles the most efficient possible distance between towns. As some of these towns grew and became larger, they developed into specialized cities with larger spheres of influence that could support more specialized shops and services. The video explains how Apple stores and Starbucks use population density to determine the locations of their stores and what factors influence the spread of cities in the real world.

In this section, the video explains that water, particularly oceans and rivers, has the greatest influence on the location of cities. This is due to the economic efficiency of being near bodies of water for transportation of goods. Resources also attract cities, with many ancient cities growing near natural resources such as Pittsburgh in the United States. Mountains can either provide protection or hinder development, with mountains serving as a barrier to westward development in the United States until technology overcame this obstacle. Mountains also offer resources, which can bring cities to the location despite the challenges. Finally, the video shows that while many cities are located in geographically efficient locations, human factors can also influence city location.

In this section, the video discusses why civilizations succeeded in some places and failed in others. One plausible theory is that Europe and Asia succeeded because they were wider instead of taller. When a continent is wide, there is more land with roughly the same climate allowing for the expansion of early civilizations. As a result, early empires like the Qing Dynasty, the Abbasid Caliphate, the Umayyad Caliphate, and the Mongol empire were all in Eurasia and they expanded horizontally. The success of America can also be attributed to its similar climate to Europe. Furthermore, if the world only had one city, the optimal place to live would be in south-central Asia, with Bangladesh being a viable option.
