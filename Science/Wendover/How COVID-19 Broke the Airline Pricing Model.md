# Summary of How COVID-19 Broke the Airline Pricing Model

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the airline industry's pricing model, which usually relies on matching supply to demand through pricing fluctuations. However, due to the uncertain and volatile demand caused by the pandemic, the computers that regulate pricing failed to extract the highest potential revenue from each flight. Airlines have had to rely on humans rather than algorithms to manage revenue during this time, and the uncertainty of future demand complicates downsizing tactics. While airlines are trying to predict demand by understanding external conditions, sudden spikes in coronavirus cases and travel restrictions continue to lead to lower passenger demand and revenue loss.

In this section, the video explains how the COVID-19 pandemic has broken the airline pricing model. Airlines normally match supply to demand, but due to the difficulty in regulating demand, they regulate both simultaneously. However, when the pandemic hit and demand plummeted, the computers tasked with extracting the most revenue out of each flight failed to do so, leading to plummeting prices. The issue that the airline industry now faces is the uncertainty of demand for the future, which complicates their downsizing tactics.

In this section, it is explained how airlines regulate demand to increase it in the winter and suppress it in the summer, instead of flying a stable number of flights year-round. They do this by tweaking their schedule mostly on a month-to-month or week-to-week basis and using pricing as the number one tool to regulate demand. Airlines rely on these price fluctuations to end up with a plane exactly full, exactly at departure, therefore extracting the exact highest potential level of revenue from the flight. However, due to the pandemic, the airline industry has experienced a sharp drop-off in demand, leading to uncertainty about how people will respond to changes in pricing and making it difficult to predict recovery.

In this section, the video explains how the pandemic has broken the airline industry's pricing model and how airlines have relied on humans rather than algorithms to manage revenue during this period. The demand patterns during and after the pandemic remain uncertain, and airlines have to predict them by understanding external conditions. However, second spikes in coronavirus cases and domestic travel restrictions have led to lower passenger demands, resulting in airlines' loss of revenue even when they manage to fill their flights. The video also mentions that uncertainty is a force of nature that we can never get rid of, and Brilliant's "Knowledge and Uncertainty" course is an excellent way to learn about the mathematics of uncertainty in a fun and interactive way.
