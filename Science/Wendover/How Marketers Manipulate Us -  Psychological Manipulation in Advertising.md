This video explains how marketers manipulate consumers using two main psychological methods in advertising. The first method is called “mere exposure”, where companies expose consumers to their brand to build their brand image in their minds. The second method is “classic conditioning”, where brands use specific feelings or reactions associated with their product in their advertisements to relate them to the unconscious images consumers store in their minds. The video also discusses how marketers promote a lifestyle or image rather than the actual product, with luxury car brands and Beats headphones being given as examples of this technique.

In this section, we learn about the two main psychological methods that marketers use in advertising. The first is called the “mere exposure” method, where companies expose consumers to their brand to build their opinion and corresponding “brand image” in their minds. The other method, called “classic conditioning”, is based on the experiments conducted by Ivan Pavlov with dogs. Brands use specific feelings, reactions, or images associated with their product in their advertisements to relate them to the unconscious images consumers store in their minds. The method always works, and car brands are the biggest culprits of this sneaky technique.

In this section, the transcript discusses how marketers manipulate consumers by promoting a lifestyle or image rather than the actual product. Luxury car brands and SUV advertisements, for example, often depict individuals living a certain lifestyle and doing certain activities, which creates an association with the brand rather than the car itself. Similarly, Beats headphones are considered a premium product despite manufacturing costs of only $14 because of their marketing and brand image. Celebrity sponsorships, high prices, and sturdy packaging all raise people's expectations and likely psychologically make the headphones seem better.
