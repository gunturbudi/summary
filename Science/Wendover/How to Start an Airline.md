In this section, the video discusses the opportunity for airline entrepreneurship during the pandemic crisis, which has forced industry leaders to pick a new path to capture consumers' new needs and wants. However, starting an airline is a complex and capital-intensive endeavor, and getting to the necessary scale for their size could be a challenge to new airlines. The video highlights that successful airlines need a unique business model that differentiates them from their competitors in terms of price, speed, convenience, or other factors, or the legacy airlines will crush them before they can compete.

In this section, we learn about three promising start-up airlines set to launch in 2021, each with a unique business model that does not involve competing with full-service network carriers. These models include FlyPop, which is launching long-haul, low-cost flights from the UK to secondary cities in India without existing non-stop service; Play Airlines, which is focusing on facilitating low-cost transatlantic travel with connecting itineraries through Iceland; and Breeze Airways, which seeks to launch "hub-busting" flights on underserved US routes without existing non-stop service. However, securing funding for start-up airlines is difficult, and many fail before or after launch due to this. The lack of an established ecosystem of investors willing to fund airline start-ups is a significant obstacle, and the process of obtaining an air operator's certificate is also costly and time-consuming.

In this section, we learn about the two types of certificates that airlines can hold in the US - part 135 and part 121, and the difficulties involved in obtaining each of them. Part 121 certificates, for large commercial airlines, require significant investment in infrastructure and extensive documentation, making it almost impossible without consultancy firms. In contrast, part 135 certificates are easier to obtain and have less-stringent regulations. Some startups prefer to purchase existing certificates rather than going through the complicated process of obtaining one. Once the certificate is obtained, acquiring airplanes is one of the simpler steps. Startups often use leasing options that allow for costs to be spread out and minimize risk. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has made it easier for startups to lease airplanes as existing airlines are downsizing their fleets, making aircraft available faster.

In this section, the video discusses the aircraft acquisition process for starting an airline. The availability of used aircraft in the market can have a significant impact on the cost and choice of aircraft for the airline. Moreover, newer aircraft may require a leaseback agreement with another company to make the acquisition financially feasible. However, these are just a few of the many aspects of airline entrepreneurship, and the video suggests that focusing on business model selection, funding, certification, and aircraft acquisition can help prevent the eventual failure of a startup airline. Finally, the video highlights the Skillshare platform, which offers thousands of classes taught by real people who use the skills they teach, making it a great resource for those who want to learn new skills.
