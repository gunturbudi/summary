The video discusses how airlines are struggling with outdated and over-stacked IT systems that were never designed to handle the volume of industry growth in the decades since their initial development. The problems of old, over-stacked IT systems don't stop with the backend, as customer-facing systems might look good on the surface, the most important one, the very system that makes it all possible was created as close in time to the Wright Brothers' first flight as to today.

Southwest Airlines' decision to cancel flights in advance of Winter Storm Elliot led to widespread cancellations and losses. The article blames the airline's legacy system for being inefficient in the face of weather disruptions. SkySolver, a tool that Southwest used to manage cancellations, was limited by data input and crew availability. When the storm became worse, SkySolver's solutions became less viable, requiring manual intervention.

The airline industry's problem with absolutely ancient IT is that it's difficult to rebook stranded passengers using the GDS, which limits potential revenue. For example, a passenger could fly to a different airport, take a taxi to the original airport, and make the original flight.

The airline industry has been struggling with outdated IT systems for decades, and there are increasing numbers of workarounds and solutions to these systems' constraints. One example is the New Distribution Capability standard, which allows for more complex backend communication, but only 51 of the 162 airlines are certified on this capability. Additionally, on Google Flights, which focuses on directing people where to book rather than booking itself, you can find Southwest schedules, but you can't find fares--with no GDS sales, there's no reason to distribute fare information. This all means that nearly all Southwest bookings are done on Southwest's website, where the airline can customize and revenue-optimize the booking process as they wish.

This transcript is excerpted from a video that covers the airline industry's problem with outdated IT systems. The video goes on to discuss how Southwest is leading the way in solving this problem by not using the outdated systems.

Airlines have been struggling with outdated IT systems for a long time, and this is causing problems for the economy as a whole. Airlines depend on outdated IT systems to fly to rural and remote communities, but this is becoming more difficult as technology advances. Governments need to decide whether airlines' IT systems are a problem, and if so, they should do something about it.
