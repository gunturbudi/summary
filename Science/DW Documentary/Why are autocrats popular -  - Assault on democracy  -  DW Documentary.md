Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=jWOlugUj4Qk

The DW Documentary "Assault on democracy" explores how autocrats use the democratic system to silence opposition and control civil society. Examples from India show how laws have made it increasingly challenging for NGOs to work and how activists risk being accused of spreading fake news or resisting state authority. The documentary also explores how autocrats in countries like Russia, China and Poland use tactics such as stigmatizing NGOs as "foreign agents" or creating "fake civil society" to avoid external criticism. However, the documentary concludes that recent protests around the world offer hope for civil society in the face of growing authoritarianism.

In this section, the documentary looks at the erosion of civil liberties and the mounting pressure against government critics and NGOs under populist and authoritarian regimes. Activists and NGOs are facing increasing intimidation and are being left short of funding while global NGOs are coming under fire. The film highlights the issue of sand mining in India, which has led to environmental violations and unsustainable practices that have destroyed landscapes, led to extreme water shortage and put farmers' lives at risk. The documentary shows how local politicians, including those from the ruling BJP party, are turning a profit using illegal methods and how this illegal activity is largely ignored by the government. The critical work of activists like Ashish Zagar, who captures these mining violations on video, is becoming ever more important to ensure that democracy is maintained.

In this section, the documentary focuses on the story of Ashish Zaga, a citizen activist from India who captures footage of the illegal blasting that damages the environment and the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of farmers. Zaga faces charges of resisting state authority and spreading fake news, which are tactics used by the government to silence environmentalists and activists. The Indian government has created laws that make it difficult for NGOs to do their work, including the Foreign Contribution Act, which has caused more than 10,000 NGOs to lose their licenses since 2014. The government claims that it is protecting national security, but such laws are actually tools for restricting civil society activity.

In this section, the focus is on the crackdown on NGOs in India, particularly Greenpeace India, that have lost their FCRA license and are being accused by the government of hindering economic growth, resulting in legal battles that have drained the resources of these organizations. The tightening of the foreign funding law in 2020, which will affect small local NGOs, is seen as an attack on organized civil society in the country. These laws are seen to be linked to Prime Minister Modi's political agenda, which includes authoritarianism, the suppression of independent institutions, and the enforcement of Hindu supremacy. Consequently, a homogenous population is emerging where the majority dictates the discourse in the country, despite it being officially a democracy.

In this section, the video discusses the ways in which autocratic governments use the democratic system to silence opposition and control civil society. Examples from Russia and China are given, where NGOs and human rights organizations are being stigmatized as "foreign agents" and "spies" and are subjected to fines and harassment. Additionally, the rise of "fake civil society" is mentioned, whereby state agents create fake NGOs to promote the government's agenda while appearing to be a grassroots movement. These tactics ultimately allow those in power to maintain the appearance of democracy while avoiding external criticism.

In this section, the DW Documentary explores how critical civil society is necessary for a functioning democracy, but this is increasingly becoming a challenge in countries with authoritarian leaders. In Putin's Russia, there has been a crackdown on critical NGOs, making it almost impossible for them to work, despite the presence of the appearance of democracy. In Poland, the right-wing populist party, Law and Justice, has limited the scope of critical civil society, leading to NGOs advocating for women's rights receiving funding cuts. The government has even established a national freedom institute that regulates funding allocation to control critical voices. However, privately organized protests and grassroots actions have grown stronger among women's groups.

In this section, the documentary examines the rise of ultra-conservative organizations in Poland that advocate for traditional gender roles and values, while demonizing the LGBTQ+ community. This has led to a united front between the current government and the Catholic Church, which has resulted in new legal measures aimed at limiting the influence of NGOs that support women's and victims' rights. One of the main organizations responsible for promoting anti-LGBTQ+ policies is the Ordo Juris Institute for Legal Culture, which has close ties to Poland's ruling politicians and has pushed for stricter abortion laws, including a bill to ban abortion in 2016. The rise of these organizations has led to violence, hatred, and the declaration of a third of Poland's provinces and municipalities as being "free of LGBT ideology."

In this section, we meet Ali Farooz, a journalist who had to flee from Russia and now lives in Germany. Farooz used to work for Novaya Gazetta, an important independent newspaper in Russia where several of his colleagues were murdered for their journalism work. Farooz was arrested by the police and was facing deportation, which could have resulted in imprisonment, torture and even death due to his sexual orientation being a punishable offense in Uzbekistan. Thanks to the efforts of his colleagues and international protests launched by different newspapers, Farooz was eventually freed from prison after six months.

In this section, the video examines the assault on journalism and independent reporting in countries with autocrats in power. Journalists critical of their government are often exiled or silenced through government control of media and the courts. Putin, for example, has worked to gain control over national television stations which now serve the state's interests, and Putin understands the power of words and journalism. However, as seen in India, where a controversial agricultural reform bill was passed, the public often largely approves of these measures, making it difficult to say that restricting these freedoms isn't democratic. Many farmers in India live at or below the poverty line, and the bill has left them vulnerable to exploitation by large corporations.

00:40:00
In this section, the documentary looks at recent protests around the world and how they have become a source of hope for civil society in the face of growing authoritarianism. In India, the protests against farming laws have become the largest since Modi came to power and have been a victory for civil society. In Russia, people took to the streets following the arrest of Alexei Navalny, while in Poland, protests against the near-total ban on abortions raged on for months. Despite facing opposition from repressive governments, civil rights advocates, NGOs, and activists continue to rise up and resist, demonstrating the power of civil society to effect change.
