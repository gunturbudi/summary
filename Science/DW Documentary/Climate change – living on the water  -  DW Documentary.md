The DW Documentary "Climate change – living on the water" explores the potential of living on the water as a solution to the challenges of climate change and urbanization. The documentary showcases various designs of floating buildings and cities around the world, including the work of the Netherlands-based Waterstudio. The segment also examines the reality of climate change's impact on low-lying coastal areas around the world and the urgency of finding solutions, with floating cities presented as one possible solution. The video emphasizes the importance of taking responsibility for climate change and rising sea levels due to human actions.

In this section, climate experts discuss the impact of rising sea levels and melting ice caps on coastal regions around the world. Despite uncertainty about the exact extent of sea level rise, even a smaller increase could have major impacts, including flooding in major cities such as London, Boston, Shanghai, Washington D.C., and Mumbai. While some countries like the Netherlands have developed innovative concepts such as floating homes to adapt to rising sea levels, experts warn that without limiting greenhouse gas emissions, the effects of climate change will eventually become unstoppable.

In this section, the potential of living on the water to address the challenges of climate change and urbanization is discussed. Waterstudio, an architectural firm in the Netherlands, is known for developing "floating solutions", allowing for flexibility and adaptability in building on water. This concept includes the potential for floating schools, offices, and supermarkets. Koen Olthuis, the founder of Waterstudio, believes that architects and urban planners play an important role in helping communities adapt to rising sea levels, and envisions the creation of a floating metropolis called the Blue City that grows out of existing cities. With floating platforms that can support almost anything from parks to houses, towers, and more, the potential for living on the water is seemingly endless.

In this section, the documentary showcases various designs of floating buildings and cities around the world. The designs include the Maldive Islands, Citadel apartment complex in the Netherlands, a floating city, a floating mosque, and a 25-storey hotel tower in Dubai. Koen Olthuis, the founder of Waterstudio, is mainly interested in designing floating residential communities and is currently designing a mid-rise tower for Rotterdam. Waterstudio's primary goal is to make the quality of the comfort onboard the floating buildings the same as on land. Rotterdam has a comprehensive flood-control system, including the Maesland storm-surge barrier, which takes just two hours to close the gates and protects one million people. The government finance efforts to help parts of Rotterdam's city center collect and drain excess water in an emergency as well.

In this section, we learn about the unique and environmentally-friendly floating structures in Rotterdam, including pavilions cooled by surface water and heated with solar energy, hexagonal islands made of recycled plastic and planted with vegetation, and houseboats made of 24 layers of corrugated cardboard. We also hear about innovative housing units in Amsterdam's Ijburg district, comprised of 75 units built at a shipyard and anchored to steel poles driven into the lakebed, with concrete tubs of different sizes to balance the weight and adapt to tides. The Netherlands encourages experimentation and using their projects as examples for others to follow. With climate change causing extremes in weather, living on water may become a necessary adaptation for many cities around the world.

In this section, the DW Documentary explores the futuristic projects of renowned architect and oceanographer Jacques Rougerie. Rougerie has been working on the futuristic SeaOrbiter for decades, which is an ocean-based research vessel shaped like a seahorse, with plans for a total height of 58 meters, with 31 meters below the water’s surface. The vessel could accommodate up to 22 scientists and its purpose is to study the immeasurable diversity of creatures, like zooplanktons, found in the sea. Rougerie says that its design, called the international space station of the ocean, could become popular again if climate change continues to progress. Other architects have also joined in creating futuristic projects ranging from marine research stations off the Balinese coast to underwater hotels that harness wave energy to generate electricity.

In this section, the documentary looks at different architectural visions for living on the water. The possibility of constructing floating communities and cities is explored with different designs and blueprints for underwater hotels, submerged restaurants, and fully-submerged living quarters presented. The segment also examines the reality of climate change's impact on low-lying coastal areas around the world and the impending threat of rising sea levels, which prompts architects and visionaries to create plans for sustainable living environments that can adapt to new climate conditions.

00:30:00
In this section, the urgency of finding solutions to the threat of rising sea levels and climate change is emphasized. The potential for millions of climate refugees and the need for long-term planning and vision are discussed. Floating cities are presented as one possible solution, with projects such as Jacques Rougerie's design for a floating city off Tahiti, the Seasteading Institute's concept for a "Floating City Project," and the UN-coordinated Oceanix project all aiming to provide affordable and adaptable floating communities. The danger of storm surges and flooding is illustrated by the experience of Hamburg in 1962, and the need for adaptation and prevention measures is highlighted.

00:35:00
In this section, the documentary discusses how major cities, such as Hamburg and London, are facing risks from rising sea levels due to climate change. Hamburg is building new dikes and flood control structures, while London has the Thames Barrier, which is reaching the end of its lifetime. However, science predicts that sea levels will continue to rise faster than anticipated, leaving many communities to make difficult decisions about their future. Some areas may have to be abandoned due to a lack of funds for flood protection, while others are investing heavily in new systems and designs to adapt to an uncertain future.

00:40:00
In this section, the video explains how floating homes, like those in Amsterdam, are becoming more popular as a lifestyle choice but also offer a potential refuge during a climate crisis. Living on the water is an untapped living space and can allow for a closer connection to nature. Working with the water and embracing it may be a better way to adapt to climate change rather than building bigger barriers. The video also emphasizes the importance of taking responsibility for climate change and rising sea levels due to human actions.
