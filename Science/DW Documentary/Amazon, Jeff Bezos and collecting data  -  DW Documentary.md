The DW Documentary "Amazon, Jeff Bezos, and Collecting Data" delves into the concept of data capitalism, Amazon's strategy of collecting data to advance its product recommendations, and the impact of the company on the traditional retail market. The footage explores how Amazon's use of data has led to vast amounts of personal information being collected, raising concerns over privacy protection. The documentary highlights that Amazon's massive database of customer information could lead to a future where Amazon knows everything about its users, posing a threat to privacy, democracy, and personal freedom. Critics warn that Amazon's AI technology and image recognition capabilities could be used for government surveillance and manipulation of behavior and beliefs, leading to a monopolistic future where a single company controls essential aspects of our lives.

In this section, the documentary explores the concept of data capitalism and how Amazon is at the forefront of the radical change to this data age. It highlights that Amazon wants to be the one-stop-shop for everything, and it controls almost half of online trade in the US. Although the filmmakers were not able to get an interview with Amazon personnel, they managed to interview a former Amazon chief scientist who spoke very highly of CEO Jeff Bezos. The documentary suggests that with the amount of data Amazon collects, it could one day know what consumers need before they even think of it, raising questions about privacy and giving up control.

In this section, the video discusses Amazon's strategy of collecting data on their customers to create a highly detailed personality profile that can be used for targeted advertising and product recommendations. The company's use of data has resulted in vast amounts of information being collected on individuals, including their location, web browsing history, and preferences. This practice has attracted criticism from data protection activists, who argue that individuals should have greater control over their personal information. Despite this, Amazon continues to use data to improve the customer experience and develop new products.

In this section, the transcript discusses how Amazon collects and uses customer data to make product recommendations. Jeff Bezos and his team analyze this data to identify patterns and pinpoint preferences that customers might not be aware of. This leads to accurate product recommendations, which make up 30% of Amazon's turnover. The transcript also discusses how retailers in general are interested in screening their customers to better understand how they tick, using the evaluation of Big Data to identify buying behavior patterns. Amazon's autodidactic machines recognize these patterns and make it the leader in the field. By knowing when customers are likely to have a baby, Amazon can put their product in front of them and win a new long-term customer.

In this section, the video looks at the impact Amazon has had on Seattle, where the company's HQ is located. While the city is booming for a few people, for many others, it has become unaffordable and unlivable. Years of low wages have saved the company money, and Amazon employees in some regions of the US depend on government food stamps. Seattle City Council wanted to introduce a tax for large companies, but Amazon threatened to close jobs if theÂ tax passed, and instead, Amazon hands out bananas free of charge every day to anyone who wants them. Furthermore, according to people who know about retailing, Amazon is accelerating the decline of small shops.

In this section, the video discusses how small and medium-sized cities are experiencing a rising vacancy rate, with some already at 40%, largely due to Amazon's takeover of the traditional retail market. While cities die, companies like Picnic try to fight fire with fire, using data to make the customer shopping experience as efficient as possible. The approach of Amazon, on the other hand, is completely different, with the company continually expanding into new markets using its power to push down prices and set conditions for traders and producers. As Amazon continues to take over the market and set its own rules, European regulators have grown increasingly skeptical of the company's practices, with Google recently being fined 4.3 billion euros and Amazon paying a quarter of a billion euros in back taxes due to competition concerns.

In this section, the video discusses the investigation into whether Amazon is using its data power against small online merchants. The Digital Council, which was called upon by Angela Merkel to ensure that Germany does not miss the digital connection, is seeking to tackle the root of the problem by forcing Amazon to share its data with others. This is seen as the only way to prevent Amazon from becoming completely unchallenged and using its data tools for completely different purposes, such as aiding police work through facial recognition software.

00:30:00
In this section, it is explained how the Washington County police department in Oregon uses Amazon's facial recognition software to detect and solve crimes. The police are able to take pictures from security cameras and upload them onto Amazon servers which index the images and create a mathematical algorithm for each picture. This algorithm is compared to database of 300,000 booking photos and can even recognize identikit sketches with some accuracy. However, privacy advocates warn against the temptation to abuse the technology as Amazon's cloud service could provide a truly powerful tool for government surveillance in conjunction with information already gathered by governments.

00:35:00
In this section, various experts and professors express their concerns regarding the widespread adoption of Amazon's vast image and video recognition capabilities. Critics worry that this technology will be linked with city surveillance cameras, resulting in overt monitoring of public spaces. Furthermore, Professor Shoshana Zubov deems Amazon's development of AI technology such as Alexa a "profound threat to democracy," since the company can extract private experiences for profit and consolidate an unprecedented amount of power. Some even speculate that Amazon may know more about its customers than all elected officials combined, with the potential to manipulate their behaviors and beliefs.

00:40:00
In this section, the dangers of Amazon's data collection are explored, as the company's vast database of customer information could potentially lead to a monopolistic future where Amazon knows everything about its users. The price of this convenience may come at the cost of privacy, freedom, social bonds, and democracy, as the risk of a single company controlling essential aspects of our lives is too high. The hypothetical scenario of Amazon knowing everything about our personal lives, such as medical records and food preferences, poses serious concerns about privacy and data protection.
