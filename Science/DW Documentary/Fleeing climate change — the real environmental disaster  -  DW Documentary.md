In Jakarta, Indonesia, the problems of climate change, such as heavy traffic, pollution, and flooding, are becoming more and more apparent to residents. The city is also subsiding due to groundwater depletion, and in February 2013 nearly half of the city was underwater. The government has begun to build a seawall, but it is only partially successful. The city's coastal areas are especially at risk of flooding.

The documentary "Fleeing climate change — the real environmental disaster" discusses the potential mass migration of people due to climate change. According to the documentary's experts, the world's coldest regions are the most vulnerable to climate change, due to the fact that they contain large amounts of permafrost. If the permafrost melts, it releases large amounts of carbon and methane into the atmosphere, which would speed up global warming.

The video discusses how permafrost is melting and releasing a large amount of greenhouse gas, which is helping to slow down climate change. Scientists from around the world are turning their attention to the permafrost, and the potential impact it could have on climate change. If all of the world's permafrost were to melt, it could have a huge impact on the global economy and infrastructure.
