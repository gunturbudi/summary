This video discusses the history of human dietary habits, and how over the course of human evolution, the percentage of animal products in the diet decreased while the percentage of carbohydrates and proteins increased. By the Neolithic Revolution, the percentage of animal products in the diet had dropped to around 10-15% of total caloric intake.

Today, the percentage of animal products in the diet is still relatively low, but has increased again in recent years as the population has grown.
