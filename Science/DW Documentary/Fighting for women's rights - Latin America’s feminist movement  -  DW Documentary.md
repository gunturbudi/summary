In this section, the focus is on Latin America’s feminist movement, as women take to the streets to demand justice and respect, with the end of violence against women. Through the green wave movement, women have come to demand the right to make their own decisions about their bodies and lives, leading to the decriminalization of abortions in countries like Argentina and Colombia. The fight over women's rights continues as strict bans on abortions remain in many parts of the region, with women being criminalized for having abortions and could be jailed.

In this section, the documentary explores the fight for women's rights in Latin American countries, focusing on the ongoing struggle for abortion rights. While the symbol of the green scarf has become an icon of the feminist movement in many countries, including El Salvador and Argentina, it remains difficult to win the battle for reproductive rights in some conservative areas. Nevertheless, the left-wing government in Argentina has finally legalised safe and free early pregnancy abortions up to 14 weeks, in a hard-fought victory for the women's movement and political coordination. However, the issue remains divisive, with right-wing Christians and extreme conservatives opposing the change in legislation.

In this section, the video explores the feminist movements in Argentina and Mexico. The campaigners in Argentina were able to successfully mobilize public support for the legalization of abortion, as shown in the use of green scarves as their symbol. This victory has inspired women in Mexico to fight for their rights and safety, as violence against women is still a prevalent issue in the country. The video also discusses the deeply-rooted problem of machismo in Mexico, which treats women as possessions and justifies violence with love and jealousy. The protesters in Mexico demand justice for murdered women and call for an end to the patriarchal gender system that enables such violence.

In this section, the documentary highlights the ongoing issue of violence against women in Mexico, where on average, 10 women are killed every day and where the government often downplays assaults on women while denouncing their graffiti. Lourdes, a mother searching for her missing daughter, is shown to have lost confidence in the authorities and has been gathering information herself and passing it on to them. Despite this, there has been no progress made in her daughter's case, which has been ongoing for three years and five months.

In this section, the video highlights the issues that the justice system in Latin America faces when dealing with women's rights violations. It sheds light on the slow and inefficient nature of the system, which leads to a staggering 98.5% of violent acts going unpunished. Additionally, the gender culture in the region leads to men not taking active responsibility, contributing to the oppressive system. The case of Lesvy, a young woman who was found dead and declared a suicide by authorities, is used to demonstrate the negligence of investigators and the need for authorities to create a prosecutor's office dedicated to femicides. After Lesvy's case, politicians and the judiciary were forced to react and apologize for poorly investigated cases.

In this section, we see how women in Mexico have taken matters into their own hands to fight for their rights. Due to a lack of resources and political will, many women have lost faith in the state's ability to provide justice and support. Instead, they turn to their friends and community for help. One example is Anne, who, along with her group called the Michis, provides resources and support for women seeking abortions. They raise awareness about contraceptives and the common experience of violence against women. Through their actions, they hope to bring attention to the issues that affect women in Mexico and create a safer and more just society.

In this section, the documentary highlights the growing influence of Evangelical Pentecostals in Brazil and their close ties to conservative forces like former President Bolsonaro. With their promise of social advancement to hard-working citizens, the churches have stepped in amidst raging inequality and failed state support. Silas Malafaia, one of the richest pastors in Brazil, yields significant political power with nearly 9 million followers on social media and sees himself fighting a culture war against the left and gender equality proponents. He strongly supports the patriarchal family with the man as its head, a dogma of Brazilian machismo that Bolsonaro reinforces.

00:35:00
In this section, we see the effects of the far-right's policies on feminists in Brazil. Victims of domestic violence are having a hard time because of the current government, as it represents an attitude towards women from the Middle Ages. The liberalization of gun laws makes women's safety even more vulnerable. Meanwhile, women in Tucuman, Argentina, have finally gained legalized access to healthcare, but the ban on taking conscience objection persists, where 27 out of 30 doctors refuse to apply the law.

00:40:00
In this section, the documentary highlights the struggles of the feminist movement in Latin America, particularly focusing on the fight for legal abortion. Despite facing opposition from the majority of the region, activists like Cecilia Ousset are working hard to provide information and support for women seeking abortions. The recent legalization of abortion in Argentina has given women more rights and protections, making life-changing differences in their ability to access legal and safe medical procedures. While the feminist movement in Latin America still has work to do, including fighting for the rights of trans people and other marginalized groups, their strength lies in their unity and they do not plan to give up the progress they have achieved.
