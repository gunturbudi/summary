Bangladesh is struggling with floods and erosion that is causing homes to collapse and entire villages to disappear. The driver of a rickshaw in Bangladesh is from Kurigram, another region that has been hit hard by flooding. Kurigram is located far away from the sea, in the north of the country, and the devastation comes from giant rivers, like the Bramaputra and the Ganges, that have overflowd due to melting of Himalayan ice.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, and every year, an average of 700,000 people are displaced by natural disasters. Due to global warming, Bangladesh is at risk of losing more than 10 percent of its territory to rising sea levels by 2050.

However, there are also stories of hope, as Bangladeshi entrepreneurs are adapting and growing their businesses in spite of the challenges posed by climate change. For instance, four million workers in Bangladesh produce jeans, T-shirts, and shoes worn by people all over the western world, but the manufacture of these cheap clothes comes at a price for the environment. Every day, tons of toxic wastewater are dumped into the natural surroundings, but in the long run, this will cause cancer. Despite constituting a public health hazard, the industry is thriving and has been a major engine for economic growth in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh is also on course to be removed from the group of least developed countries by 2024, and thanks to dedicated entrepreneurs, the first model companies are now already emerging. People working in green factories will not want to leave them, because of the sound working conditions.

Bangladesh is struggling with floods and erosion that is causing homes to collapse and entire villages to disappear. The driver of a rickshaw in Bangladesh is from Kurigram, another region that has been hit hard by flooding. Kurigram is located far away from the sea, in the north of the country, and the devastation comes from giant rivers, like the Bramaputra and the Ganges, that have overflowd due to melting of Himalayan ice. Every year, thousands of houses are destroyed and entire villages disappear under the water.

Bangladesh is facing challenges in the form of flooding, poverty, and child marriages. One of the major issues is that due to the financial burden, many girls are married off at a very young age, often before they reach the age of 15. This has led to girls being unhappy and unable to get an education. Despite this, some families have decided to marry off their daughters to prevent them from becoming unhappier. Due to the floods, Sabina's family's rice fields have been destroyed, and her father has decided to allow her to stay with her parents for now. Swimming instructor Sohag has been working for five years and has seen a lot of children die in accidents while swimming.

Bangladesh is struggling with flooding, as well as pollution from factories and wastewater plants. In recent years, 185 tanneries have set up shop along the banks of the Dhaleshwari River, and 80% of the hides produced in Bangladesh are exported and supply the ready-to-wear footwear and leather goods industries worldwide. A wastewater plant has been built here, but has insufficient capacity and reportedly empties its tanks into the Dhaleshwari - including untreated sewage. Investigating the scene, Pinaki finds that the lead he received appears to be correct and that this pipe leads directly from the wastewater treatment plant, which is supposed to be treated, but is not treated.

Bangladesh's struggling with flooding is captured in a documentary by DW reporter Pinaki Roy. The effluent treatment plant cannot handle highly toxic chromium, so the waste is dumped into the river instead. The tannery also denies any health hazards from their use of chemicals, but the reporter is not convinced. After witnessing dangerous dumping practices, Roy leaves the tannery. He worries about the long-term effects of the pollution on the river and the workers.

Bangladesh's textile industry is rapidly developing, but the environment is rarely a priority; workers burn toxic fabric scraps to melt tar, which is environmentally harmful but widely used; after work, they have to eat bananas to relieve the pain.

Bangladesh is struggling with flooding that has killed 1,100 people and left 35,000 homeless. The mill visited in the video is a model factory that has implemented various water-saving measures, including using ozone machines and recycling wastewater. The group produces clothing for major brands, including DÃ©cathlon, Promod, and H&M, and has been awarded the Platinum status by the United States Green Building Council. The factory washes over 60,000 garments a day, and is one of the greenest clothing companies in the world. However, the factory's owner, the Bitopi Group, is trying to hide the lack of environmental protection measures and safety precautions for the workers from outsiders. At the same time, the owner of a nearby shipyard is trying to modernize the site without taking into account the environmental concerns of the workers.

This documentary follows Bangladeshi workers as they're injured and killed on demolition sites, risking their jobs to speak up. After months of negotiations, a "clean" shipyard agrees to open its doors to the filmmakers, showing them a different world where safety is paramount and accidents are routinely covered up. Workers earn more in modern construction sites, with better conditions and higher wages, and are involved in the emergence of a new middle class.

Bangladesh's struggle with flooding is documented in this video, which shows how real estate agent Hossain is trying to sell a luxury apartment to a lawyer married to a fighter pilot. The apartment has over 300 square meters of space, and several balconies. The client seems interested, and asks about the price. Hossain offers her 7 hundred 20 thousand euros for the apartment, which is expensive, but right now business is good. If temperatures continue to rise, Bangladesh will have more than 20 million climate refugees.
