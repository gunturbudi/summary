The "Rubber Tires - A Dirty Business" documentary highlights the harsh realities of the tire industry, where sustainability and fair working conditions are often ignored by customers. The film follows journalists to Thailand, the world's largest producer of natural rubber, where workers face dangerous conditions and low wages while working in plantations and factories. The documentary team attempts to interview major tire manufacturers like Bridgestone, Michelin, and Goodyear on their responsible natural rubber sourcing efforts, but many refuse comments beyond written statements. The film also explores the negative perception of tire retreads despite their effectiveness and sustainability, urging the need for change in the industry.

Detail Summary:

In this section, we see the importance of tires to road safety and the multi-billion dollar industry that exists around it. However, very few customers are interested in the sustainability or conditions of their tire production. We follow a journalist to Thailand, the world's largest producer of natural rubber, where we gain access to a plantation that harvests rubber. We see how the rubber is harvested from incisions in the bark of trees and solidified using vinegar. The importance of the rubber industry to the Thai economy makes it difficult to get information from the people involved.

In this section, we learn about the harsh conditions faced by rubber plantation workers on the edge of Bowser's plantation in Thailand. Workers from neighboring Cambodia work 12-hour night shifts, using only head torches to extract rubber from the trees. Despite the plantation owner planting new trees, the glut in the market has driven down the price per kilo, and the workers struggle to make a living, earning only around half of the minimum wage in Thailand. They live in decrepit huts, and their work involves not only the risk of snake bites but also exposure to extremely toxic herbicides, without adequate protective gear.

In this section, the documentary team visits a rubber factory in Thailand that supplies processed rubber to many well-known firms, including Goodyear. The team follows a truck to Tai Hua Rayong Rubber Factory but is immediately turned away and told they need a written request. They then visit a smaller factory that mainly processes liquid latex and asks about wages, discovering that the minimum wage is 9,000 baht, but the workers are not employees and only get a share of the profits. The team also meets an elderly couple collecting rubber and confronts a few tire manufacturers, including Bridgestone and Continental, but is declined for interviews and unable to obtain information about their suppliers. The documentary team then decides to travel to neighboring Cambodia to investigate the living conditions of people working on rubber plantations there.

In this section, the documentary explores the tough life of rubber factory workers in Cambodia, who work long hours from six in the morning to ten at night. The workers live in company-provided housing with basic amenities, earning around $150 per month for a seven-day workweek in the factory. The documentary then shifts focus to the Kak village in northeast Cambodia, where villagers have lost almost all their fertile fields due to big international companies buying land from the government to plant rubber trees. Despite demanding the return of their land, the villagers have lost hope, and new settlements have emerged on their fields, housing women and men who work on the rubber plantations in desperate conditions.

In this section, the documentary team tries to interview several tire manufacturers, including Continental, Bridgestone, Michelin, and Goodyear. Some of them refuse to provide interviews apart from written statements on their responsible natural rubber sourcing efforts. While Goodyear emphasizes recycling and responsible sourcing of raw materials in their statement, one expert in Germany thinks there is room for improvement in terms of retreading the tires of private cars instead of commercial vehicles or aircraft. Additionally, the documentary highlights that disposing of used tires in Germany is still problematic, often burning them for fuel, while Southeast Asia continues to establish more rubber plantations to meet global demand.

In this section, the documentary explores the negative perception of tire retreads, which are discarded tires that are later reprocessed to create new ones, and the misinformation that surrounds them, particularly within the auto industry. For instance, a local authority in Germany categorically ruled out using retreads for equipping police vehicles with winter tires, citing high quality specifications. However, experts have shown time and again that tires produced from high-quality worn tires through modern retread plants in Europe can match the performance of new tires, while being environmentally and financially sustainable. The documentary also highlights the effectiveness of retreads in practical scenarios, like a mechanic who opted for retreads for his family vacation and found them to be both balanced and safe on the road.
