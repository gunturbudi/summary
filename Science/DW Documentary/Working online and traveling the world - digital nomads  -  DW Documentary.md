In this section, we learn about the lifestyle of digital nomads who are able to work and travel the world with just a laptop and internet access. Pete Holdspa from Slovakia is a digital nomad who used to work a stable, well-paid job in London but decided to travel for 9 months to 1 year. Now, two and a half years later, he's still traveling and has enough money to continue doing so. He enjoys the freedom of not being limited by plans and possessions and only needs his laptop and smartphone to sustain his work as an online marketer and blogger.

In this section, the documentary follows the stories of a few digital nomads and how they work and travel at the same time. Zoopy is a digital nomad who usually spends her summer in Europe before heading to sunnier climates in Autumn and often bases herself in Bali in the winter. Along with running her own blog, Zoopy also works as a content marketing manager and coaches other digital nomads on how to start their journey. Another digital nomad, Pete, collects data online about cryptocurrencies for his employer. Pete turned his back on his old life and embraced his new lifestyle. Communication between himself and his colleagues is done virtually, primarily through Skype.

In this section, we see how digital currencies are becoming more common among digital nomads, with one team member accepting Ethereum as payment to take advantage of the cryptocurrency's potential value. Working without a base or permanent residence can be a downside to the lifestyle, but the freedom and sense of adventure that digital nomads experience compensate for it. In Bali, there are co-working spaces where freelancers and digital nomads can rent desks and use facilities like conference rooms, enabling them to work on new projects and find teams for existing projects. For approximately â‚¬150 a month, digital nomads can have a workspace with like-minded individuals, which can help curb the feeling of isolation.

In this section, we meet Supie, a digital nomad who left the German system and is investing in other areas like property, startups, and small companies. She had a burnout from working long hours and having a lot of responsibility in a marketing and event agency, which led her to focus on her passions for traveling, yoga, and cooking. These days, she makes her projects fit into her lifestyle and maintains a good balance. We also see Pete, a digital freelancer, using co-working spaces to network with startups and pick up work. He meets with Sebastian Meltz, who runs a placement agency for digital freelancers and advises Pete on the sort of jobs he could point him towards. Both Supie and Sebastian caution against potential pitfalls for digital nomads and stress the importance of stability and financial planning.

In this section, the documentary focuses on the challenges and practical considerations faced by digital nomads. While working online and traveling the world can sound idyllic, it requires a certain level of resilience and planning, as well as legal and financial considerations. One of the challenges is obtaining comprehensive insurance, but many digital nomads make do with travel insurance. Digital nomads also navigate residency requirements, taxes, and currency exchange. Social media is an essential part of their lifestyle, with many digital nomads having a strong presence on various platforms. Surprisingly, nowadays, there are even products, such as digital nomad backpacks, that cater to this lifestyle. However, while many digital nomads enjoy the freedom and adventure of this lifestyle, they acknowledge that they might eventually want to settle down, but they are not looking too far ahead just yet.

In this section, Zoopy discusses how the digital nomad lifestyle affects her personal life, and how she needs to be more organized when it comes to finding a partner and settling down. She expresses her desire to have children, but acknowledges that she needs to find someone with a compatible lifestyle or who is also ready to settle down. Despite this, Zoopy remains footloose and fancy-free for now, and is excited to move on to her next destination in Tonga and Fiji to work and pursue her passion of diving with whales.
