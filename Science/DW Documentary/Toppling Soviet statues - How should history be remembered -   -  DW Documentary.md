The debate on whether Soviet-era monuments should be preserved or erased is examined in this video. Some argue that the monuments should be removed, citing their association with crimes committed by Communist leaders like Stalin. Others suggest that they should be preserved as a connection to the victory over fascism in World War II. The Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance carefully documents Soviet monuments as they are removed from the streets, with a focus on promoting patriotic remembrance and shaping Ukraine's national identity. The difficulty of contextualizing monuments is also discussed, with some arguing that they should remain as commitments to the idea that war graves are inviolable for all eternity, while others believe preserving statues of figures like Stalin is equivalent to normalizing them. The video suggests that monuments should be preserved in some form, whether it be relocated to museums or held in their original sites as silent witnesses to the Soviet Empire.

In this section, the video discusses the debate surrounding whether or not Soviet-era monuments should be toppled and erased from history. The argument for removing them centers around their association with the crimes committed by Communist leaders like Stalin, while the argument for preservation emphasizes their connection to World War II's victory over fascism. Almira Ettinger advocates for the latter view and has created an Instagram account dedicated to preserving Soviet monuments as she believes they represent the legacy of Ukraine's own citizens and relatives. However, some view her stance as pro-Russian, and she has faced backlash on social media.

In this section, the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance's director, Anton Rabovich, explains their role in the process of desovietization, carefully documenting Soviet monuments before they are removed from the streets. The Institute focuses on shaping Ukraine's national identity and promoting patriotic remembrance, specifically the atrocities committed by the Soviet Empire, which were deliberately erased, rewritten or redefined from the narrative of the history of the country. Although the removal of some Soviet monuments is inevitable, other landmarks such as Kiev's Motherland Monument won't be destroyed, and the Ukrainian activists' video messages call for de-sovietization not just in Ukraine but in other countries, such as Germany.

In this section, the director of the Berlin German Russian Museum, Kyle's Host, discusses the difficulty of contextualizing monuments, particularly those that represent a statement that is now condemned. Host argues that the memorial in Teargotten, which commemorates the Dead, should remain as a commitment to the idea that war graves are inviolable for all eternity. However, the monument is also seen as a symbol of Russian imperialism, with its mighty T-34 tank as an expression of power. This negative association has caused similar monuments in Poland to be dismantled one after the other, while Host argues that the Teargotten tanks are a design component of the memorial and a commemoration of the Dead that should be maintained.

In this section, the video explores the controversy over the removal of Soviet-era and Russian monuments in Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. While some argue that these monuments represent a painful and oppressive past that is better forgotten, others believe that these monuments should be preserved or relocated to museums rather than simply destroyed. The video also examines how these monuments are used to assert national identity and how they are sometimes used for political purposes. The video also touches on how some monuments are still a rallying point for those who support Putin's Russia.

In this section, a debate is sparked on whether or not to preserve monuments that represent Soviet Imperial power. While some argue that preserving monuments helps in understanding history and Soviet propaganda, others, such as the director of the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance, Anton Terabovich, believe that preserving monuments that symbolize the likes of Joseph Stalin would only be one step away from normalizing him. The artist, Vladimir Kuznetsov, offers a solution with his artwork, the crack on the arch of friendship between peoples, which highlights the problem of the artificial relationship between Ukraine and Russia.

In this section, the video explores the destruction of Soviet monuments in Ukraine and the controversy surrounding it. While some view these monuments as works of art and important pieces of history, others see them as symbols of oppression and Russia's claim to power. The footage shows the devastation caused by Russian missiles and the destruction of Soviet monuments, which have caused much debate and even greater tension between Ukraine and Russia. The video suggests that the monuments should be preserved in some form, whether it be relocated to museums or held in their original sites as silent witnesses to the Soviet Empire.
