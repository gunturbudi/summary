The conversation then turns to the topic of women's rights and the lack of education and awareness in Morocco which hinders progress in this area. Later, the documentary features a visit to the Hayat Project, an animal welfare organization led by Salima Kadaoui, who shares her story and explains that animal welfare efforts also require a deeper understanding of the people and their struggles, particularly those who are uneducated and poor.

Graduates from the Spanish high school in Al Hoceima are allowed to study in Spain, and around 90% of them do so.
