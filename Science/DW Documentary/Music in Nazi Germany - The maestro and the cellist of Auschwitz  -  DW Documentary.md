This video documents the story of how the German musical profession and establishment turned overnight into Nazi collaborators. The music that was performed in Nazi Germany was often appreciated by the German population, despite the atrocities that were happening around them.

The video discusses the career of German conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler, who was banned from performing after the Second World War and faced uncomfortable questions about his Nazi past. Despite the tribunal's classification as a "follower" which carried no penalty, Furtwängler soon began performing again and his return to the stage was a great success.

In the early 1930s, Germany was considered the "land of music" with a rich tapestry of sounds - light music, jazz, classical music and contemporary compositions were all very popular. However, the National Socialists came to power in January 1933 and soon after launched a series of "wild purges" - this led to many people in the music profession leaving Germany. As Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels was responsible for music and culture in the Nazi state. Soon after the Nazis came to power, he established the Reich Chamber of Culture, which included the Reich Chamber of Music. Membership was compulsory for anyone in the field and so, these institutions allowed Goebbels to control German cultural life. As Vice President of the Reich Chamber of Music, Wilhelm Furtwängler was turned from an unpolitical artist to a political figure and received the honorary title of Prussian State Councillor. Furtwängler was so important to the Nazis that they put him on the list of "Gottbegnadeten" artists that were "gifted by god". Music was considered the most German of all art forms and the state invested a great deal of money in it, believing it shaped the

The music of Nazi Germany was often associated with nationalism and race, and this led to the suppression of musicians who were not of "German" descent. Anita Lasker, a Jewish cellist, was forced to flee her home in Breslau, Poland, in the aftermath of the Kristallnacht violence. She eventually relocated to Berlin and began studying with Leo Rostal, a Jewish cellist, before the Nazis came to power. When Kristallnacht occurred, her mother called and told her to come home quickly, but it was too late - they had been forced to flee Berlin as well. Lasker's fascination with Furtwängler, conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, begins with that moment.

Furtwängler was a celebrated conductor and composer in Nazi Germany, and his music was influential in shaping the sound of Nazi propaganda. He was very critical of the Nazi regime, but was eventually pushed out of his positions by the pressure of the regime.

Wilhelm Furtwängler, a conductor of world renown, was pressured by the Nazis to step down from his positions in the Berlin Philharmonic, State Opera, and Reich Chamber of Music. Furtwängler remained in Germany and continued to conduct for the Nazis, despite the moral degradation that came with it. Jewish cultural life continued to exist in Nazi Germany, albeit under strict Nazi control.

The video discusses the experiences of two Jewish cellists, Anita Lasker and her sister Renate, during the Holocaust. The two were sent to Auschwitz concentration camp after the deportation of their parents, and were saved from the gas chambers by a selection process that determined which prisoners would be sent to Auschwitz. Lasker was eventually sent to Auschwitz to serve out her full sentence, but was later spared when she was assigned to the orchestra.

In this video, DW Documentary discusses the relationship between Nazi Germany and Richard Wagner, with particular focus on the Reichsmusiktage of 1938. This event showcased Wagner's supposedly "German" works to a national audience, but also included examples of "degenerate" music that was targeted at ridiculing and demonizing those same works.

00:40:00
The video discusses the Nazi Degenerate Music exhibition, which displayed art and music that was considered degenerate, primarily due to its Jewish creators. The main focus of the video is on musicologist Albrecht Dümling, who has documented and annotated the material in a book. The video also features a excerpt from a live performance of the Berlin Philharmonic, which took place in 1942 as part of Furtwängler's birthday celebrations.

The author discusses a man, Joseph Goebbels, and the propaganda event he organized in which the maestro played Beethoven's "Für Elise" while shaking hands with attendees. It is said that Goebbels wiped his hands afterwards, indicating he felt something strange about the event. Alma Rosé, a violinist and director, was deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau in 1943 and had to specially arrange the pieces for the camp orchestra. Even in Auschwitz, the Germans addressed her as "Frau Alma," an unprecedented honor. She had a dignity that couldn't be ignored and led a small women's orchestra called Die Wiener Waltzermädeln.

Winifried Wagner, daughter-in-law of Richard Wagner, began directing the Bayreuth Festival in 1930 and became close friends with Hitler. In 1943, Wagner's music became part of the war and propaganda machinery and Furtwängler conducted at the festival six times. Hitler liked to go backstage after performances to meet the artists. The artists were enchanted by him and Wagner's music became part of the war.

In Nazi Germany, classical music was used to maintain morale and to serve propaganda purposes. Wagner music was especially popular among soldiers, as it portrayed the ideal of Germany as a great nation. Even as the war against the Allies progressed, some recordings of Wagnerian music were made. When Allied forces liberated Auschwitz in 1944, they found five orchestras in the camp complex. This suggests that the Nazis may have had a reason to keep these orchestras operational until the end of the war.

This video tells the story of Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, a cellist who was born in Germany during the Nazi era, but who managed to escape and later immigrate to England. Lasker-Wallfisch became known as the "cellist of Auschwitz" because she played the cello above the Verdi Requiem, a song often used as a cantorial prayer in orthodox Judaism, during her time at Auschwitz concentration camp. After the war, she returned to Germany and wrote a memoir in which she did not discuss her experiences at Auschwitz. Lasker-Wallfisch and her husband, pianist Peter Wallfisch, later retired to Switzerland.

This video documents the story of Wilhelm Furtwängler, a famous German composer and conductor who was very complicit in the crimes of the Nazi regime. However, despite the fact that his music was used to promote Nazi ideology, he never bowed to the pressure and continued to compose and conduct despite the terrible conditions in which he and other musicians had to work. After his death, Renate Lasker-Harrprecht and Anita Lasker-Wallfisch were both invited to speak in the German parliament, and Lasker-Harrprecht's son Raphael Wallfisch played the cello in the Träumerei performance. This video shows how music can transcend the horrors of history and bring people together in a time of mourning.
