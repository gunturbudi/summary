Taiwan is a small, self-governing island territory located in East Asia that is threatened by the People's Republic of China. In this video, a journalist follows a group of high school students as they watch military exercises in south Taiwan. The exercises are taking place as the military tries to prepare for a possible attack from China. The students take pictures of the soldiers as they swap their guns for brooms and dustpans in order to prepare the highway for aircraft. Despite its small size, Taiwan is a leading manufacturer of semiconductors, and the president of Taiwan is in attendance to see the military exercises.

Taiwan is an independent country that does not officially exist, but is recognized by a handful of nations. The relationship between Taiwan and China is complicated, with China never recognizing Taiwan and regards it as one of its provinces. The People's Republic of China has never allowed Taiwanese people to freely travel between the two countries, and has been fairly aggressive in its push for reunification. However, many Taiwanese people value stability and freedom more than their independence, and see a Conflict with China as the best way to preserve these values. Despite this risk, a growing number of Taiwanese are advocating for independence, including many young people.

The video discusses the tensions between Taiwan and China, and the ways in which the Taiwanese military is preparing for a potential conflict. The Sunflower Movement, which began in 2014 and sought to prevent a trade agreement between Taiwan and China, is highlighted. The video also features a retired military officer who is critical of the Mirage 2000 fighter jet, which Taiwan bought from France. Few broadcasters show any interest in the Mirage fighter, which is a fourth-generation fighter jet and not up to par with China's fleet.

The Sunflower Movement helped pave the way for the election of President Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party in 2016. Tsai's victory was a bitter defeat for the old-guard Kuomintang, which had dominated Taiwanese politics since the beginning in 1949. Audrey Tang, one of the Sunflower Movement activists, is the world's first openly transgender national minister. She is also an advocate for radical transparency, and her humorous clips don't take much time to make.

Chen is not the only one to be threatened by pro-China extremists, and Taiwan is also home to political exiles who fled Chinese-controlled Hong Kong.
