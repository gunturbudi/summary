This documentary discusses climate change and its effects on glaciers in Europe. It explains that because of the increasing temperature, the permafrost in the Alps is starting to melt, leading to a risk of rockfalls. The scientists also set off to sea to measure the thickness of the permafrost there. Next, they go to a village in Switzerland that is affected by a landslide caused by climate change. The residents there are preparing to leave because of the risk of another landslide.

Climate change is causing glaciers in Europe to melt, which poses a risk of rock fall that could damage nearby villages. Professor McKee Alucard Blatter has assembled a team of scientists to study the situation. They are headed to what they believe is one of the most intriguing spots on the mountain - a crack that has recently widened. The aerial view reveals the full extent of the danger. Many hundreds of thousands of tons of rock could fall into the valley, potentially injuring people and damaging nature.

The documentary discusses the effects of climate change on the Alps, with particular focus on how ski resorts are struggling to cope with erosion caused by artificial snow. With temperatures rising, many ski resorts will eventually have to close down, and those that do may have to find an alternative source of income.

In the video, European eco-climatologist Aneta Men soul discusses how climate change is causing changes in the Alps, with particular focus on wildfires. Men soul points out that because of the increased severity of wildfires in Italy in 2017, the region lost a significant amount of forest.

The Concordia Alpine heart is situated a few kilometers higher up and is one of the most popular Alpine hostels in Europe. The hut is under threat due to the retreat of glaciers.

The video highlights the retreat of glaciers in the European Alps, which has been occurring at a rate of 1-3 meters per year. The video also discusses the impact of climate change on these glaciers and the surrounding environment.

Glaciers in Europe are melting at an alarming rate, and it's causing major problems for the people who live near them. Mateus horse and his team of glacia experts visit Glacier 3000 in April to see that the ground has begun to crack and hiss, a sign that the glaze is dying. By mid-September, the glaciers have melted entirely. The video concludes with the tragic fact that this melting is irreversible, and the people who live near glaciers will have to adapt to a drier, hotter future.
