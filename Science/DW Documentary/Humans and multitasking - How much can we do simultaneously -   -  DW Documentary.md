The DW Documentary "Humans and Multitasking - How much can we do simultaneously?" highlights the dangers and limitations of multitasking, particularly in situations like driving or attending a lecture, where our attention can be significantly reduced. While multitasking can create a feeling of achieving a great deal, it reduces our actual attention span, making us constantly accessible, thereby reducing our ability to focus. The documentary explores the different areas where multitasking is common, from hospitals to large commercial enterprises. Finally, the documentary suggests ways to escape the multitasking spiral, like breaking down the task, taking breaks, and resolutely stopping work at the end of the day.

Detail Summary:

In this section, the video discusses how multitasking has become a routine for many individuals, but our brain is not adept at tackling different tasks simultaneously, causing stress that can have damaging effects on various brain areas. Although multitasking can create a feeling of achieving a great deal, it reduces our actual attention span, making us constantly accessible and thereby reducing our ability to focus. While multitasking can be productive at times, finding the right balance is key. Handling different tasks simultaneously depends on the tasks and conditions. While the human brain works selectively and processes most functions subconsciously, its ability for solving problems involving new and more complex mental performances is limited. It requires great attention and self-discipline to suppress the challenge posed by the other tasks, and oftentimes, people overestimate their capacities.

In this section, the video explores the dangers and limitations of multitasking, particularly in situations such as driving or attending a lecture. The attention of drivers using smartphones while driving is reduced by 40%, equivalent to driving with a blood-alcohol level of 0.8 to 1.1 per mil. In addition, students using smartphones during lectures have been shown to perform about 30% worse. The video also looks at how music affects learning, with research conducted at Zurich University showing that listening to music while learning requires significant effort and can reduce a person's ability to cope with additional tasks and stimuli.

In this section, the amount of information humans process is discussed. While eleven million bits of information impact our senses every second, we can only consciously process between eleven and sixty bits of this information. Researchers at the Leibniz Research Centre in Dortmund are studying how our speech comprehension functions and how our brains sort through different sensory stimuli like at a cocktail party. This research is becoming increasingly important, especially for working lives, as many jobs require information processing and multitasking abilities. As the workplace continues to develop and new technologies evolve, research into the mental demands of work has become increasingly important to better determine how to cope with these challenges.

In this section, scientists examine the effects of multitasking on doctors and nurses at hospitals, where they often deal with multiple demands and work interruptions, resulting in stress and potential medical errors. While urgency is determined based on an initial medical assessment, flexibility and communication are equally important, especially in emergency situations such as traumas. Similarly, in large commercial enterprises, the challenge of multitasking is maintaining an overall view of the diverse tasks, and scientists from Koblenz University study how to break down and depict tasks for better management. Overall, creating optimal workflows and clear communication is crucial in both hospital and business settings to counter the potential negative effects of multitasking.

In this section, we learn about a study conducted by Professor Komus and the Vistem consultancy, which found that 20% of capacity is wasted and 25% of turnover is lost through permanent multitasking in project management. The study involved online surveys and extensive interviews with workers and management in order to examine the work process from various angles. The major problem was that the people doing the work had to handle too many tasks from a wide range of areas, and every task had top priority. The result was overload in a team. Companies are finding that restructuring workloads and getting rid of sprints, and involving management, clients, and staff to determine realistic targets, individual workloads, and prioritizing tasks resulted in a significant improvement in efficiency. Additionally, multitasking has a negative effect on flow experience, which is the immersion in a task that has a positive effect on our sense of success and feeling of happiness.

In this section, the video highlights the concept of the polyvalent employee, who is expected to be available and accessible for all tasks and capable of handling everything simultaneously. This leads to burnout situations, which are common in many companies today. Accumulated stress causes serious exhaustion, and at some point, people are no longer able to react equally to everything. To combat this issue, mindfulness exercises are increasingly being utilized in specialized clinics for psychosomatic and mental disorders. Studies show that the function and structure of the anterior cingulate cortex, an area of the brain responsible for mindfulness regulatory processes, can be strengthened through meditation. However, it takes a long time, one to two years, to change one's lifestyle and rebuild regenerative phases into their life.

In this section, the documentary discusses the concept of multitasking and how the increased use of technology has led to a more fragmented attention span among individuals. The constant need for new stimuli and instant gratification leads to addictive behavior, with the pleasure center in the brain constantly seeking new rewards. Social media networks are specifically designed to feed this addiction through push notifications and low-intensity signals, leading individuals to believe they are multitasking effectively when in reality their attention level has been lowered to simple alarm stimuli. While digital natives may seem more adept at multitasking, their brains are still maturing, making it difficult for them to cope with rising emotional stimuli.

In this section, cognitive psychologist Professor Iring Koch studies the trainability of the human brain and analyzes the performance of Harry Kahne, a vaudeville artist of the 1920s who was known for training his mind to perform extraordinary feats. Koch notes that Kahneâ€™s example shows that difficult tasks can be combined well with practice, but there are still tiny pauses which demonstrate incomplete overlap when multitasking. The common assumption that women are better at multitasking than men is also debunked by a study conducted by psychologist Dr. Patricia Hirsch from Aachen University. The study found no difference in multitasking performance between men and women. Additionally, the stereotype that the elderly have difficulties with multitasking in the workplace is inaccurate as people with years of competence in their field can actually achieve more in their job.

00:40:00
In this segment, the documentary explores the capacity of elderly people that remains unused due to the lack of focus on this demographic. The experts suggest that the aging societies should focus on structuring the world of work to protect individuals from stress and premature burnout, especially considering the vast amount of capacity reservoir in elderly people. The documentary highlights the need to make laws to define non-accessible rights, and the efforts made by trade unions in Germany to negotiate such rights while limiting access to emails in large companies like HP to ensure a peaceful environment in the workplace. Finally, the documentary shares some ways to escape the multitasking spiral, like breaking down the task, taking breaks, and resolutely stopping work at the end of the day.
