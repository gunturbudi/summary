"The Fight for Water" is a DW documentary that examines the growing problem of water scarcity across the United States, Germany, and Afghanistan, among other regions. The program covers issues such as droughts, climate change, and water wars, and their devastating impact on communities and industries. It also highlights the importance of taking action to address the issue, with the potential for large-scale migration and displacement, and the involvement of decision-makers and elected officials to prevent even more disastrous consequences. The documentary emphasizes that water scarcity is a critical concern for all state governments, with the decline of California's largest freshwater lake serving as a warning of what's to come if no action is taken.

Detail Summary:

In this section, the documentary focuses on the water crisis faced by different parts of California. Avila Beach, a resort town in Southern California, and Mendocino, another town up north, are both experiencing droughts and are dependent on trucked water. The lack of water has forced the closure of public bathrooms and led to portable toilets being set up by restaurant and cafe owners. It's a nightmare for locals, and the droughts are threatening the key industry of both towns. The water crisis may lead to international conflicts, and humankind's approach to water is potentially lethal.

In this section, the documentary explores water shortages in Germany, which have become a growing problem in recent years due to droughts and high levels of consumption. In some parts of Germany, the supply of drinking water has been repeatedly strained, with local water levels remaining critically low. The groundwater levels at measuring sites in Bavaria have dropped by as much as 13 meters since 2012, leading to fears of less water being available in the future. The dwindling supply of water has led authorities to close down wells and look for alternative solutions. The impact of climate change has worsened the situation, leading to critical water shortages in some areas that were unexpected.

In this section, the documentary explores the impact of climate change on water supplies in Germany. Citizens in communities such as Toy Schnitz are reliant on long-distance pipelines for drinking water, as their wells have dried up due to changing weather conditions. Dams, which were previously opposed due to the environmental damage they cause, are now seen as crucial for supplying water to major cities such as Nuremberg and WÃ¼rzburg. Professor Martin Gambo predicts that the impact of climate change could worsen water scarcity in Germany, and it is crucial for people to take action to prevent even more devastating consequences. Hydrologist Jay Famiglietti warns that water scarcity is increasing faster than previously estimated, and research efforts must continue to address this problem.

In this section, the Grace satellite mission is explained, which involves two satellites that respond to the mass of water on the ground, allowing scientists to measure water loss and gain worldwide. Through this measure, scientists have been able to record massive water losses globally and forecast droughts. One region identified as drying up is the US west coast, which includes Phoenix, Arizona, the fastest-growing city in America and a significant consumer of water. Phoenix's water supply comes from 450km away, through a long-distance pipeline system running through the desert from Lake Powell, one of the two largest reservoirs in the US that is now at its lowest ever level. Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in America and a source of water for Las Vegas, is also at its lowest point in history.

In this section, the state of Nevada's first climate policy coordinator Kristen Averitt discusses the likelihood of Lake Mead ever being full again due to climate change, calling it "pretty profound." She emphasizes the need for the western US to act like they live in the middle of a desert and conserve water, as drought has become a permanent state in this part of the world. Las Vegas has implemented conservation programs, such as paying residents to replace grass with drip irrigated landscaping, and now resort to an around-the-clock water patrol to ensure compliance with strict water use regulations. The city has also turned many front yards into gravel beds, and while the job of the water waste enforcement team may be difficult, they feel it has a purpose, and are dedicated to conserving every drop of water possible.

In this section, the documentary explores the issue of water scarcity in desert cities like Las Vegas and parts of California that have been expanding significantly in recent years. The growth happened with no knowledge of climate change and imperfect knowledge about water availability, making the situation even tougher. Water levels in major reservoirs serving the west of the country have dropped alarmingly in recent years, and groundwater is disappearing at a rapid rate as well. Some companies and authorities are placing their faith in innovation to provide an answer to water scarcity, but the situation is becoming critical, with the state of California and the federal government both struggling to provide enough water to the region.

00:30:00
In this section, the documentary covers the potential for future water wars due to climate change, specifically in regions like California where droughts are becoming more frequent, and Afghanistan where water scarcity is already a major issue. The documentary also shows how the wealthy in Kabul have access to clean water through groundwater pumping, while the poorer areas are left without access to clean water, leading to illnesses such as diarrhea. The disparity shows how access to water can determine a person's wellbeing, and how technological aid can create inequality.

00:35:00
In this section, experts discuss the potential for large-scale migration caused by water scarcity in the future, with up to 3 billion people potentially living outside of ideal environmental conditions by 2070. The Pacific Institute has been keeping track of conflicts over water resources, which have been increasing in recent years including a devastating drought in Syria that contributed to the conflict there. Despite warnings from scientists, including the Grace mission scientists who briefed the Pentagon in 2009, many warnings about water scarcity have gone ignored which can be frustrating for experts. NASA data shows that Germany has lost 2.4 cubic kilometers of water per year for the last two decades, causing concern among environmental officials who say that when changes are finally tangible, it is already too late.

00:40:00
In this section, the importance of water scarcity is highlighted, with the situation being deemed a prime concern for every state government. The journey through the western US ends at the Sultan Sea, California's largest freshwater lake, which is now drying up and becoming a warning of what water scarcity could mean for us. The importance of taking action and standing up to notice is highlighted, as the trajectory of water scarcity is alarming and could happen anywhere. The segment highlights the need for elected officials and decision-makers to take notice of this issue.
