This YouTube video discusses the pollution of the Ganges River in India by textile factories. It discusses the 12 steps that the river has gone through to try to treat the pollution, and how this affects the cost of textiles in Indonesia. The reporter also points out that, because of global demand for textiles, the production of textiles in Indonesia is expected to increase by 75% by 2030.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
The world's most polluted river is found in Indonesia. The river is used for agriculture, drinking water, and fish breeding, but is also a source of plastic pollution. The river is also a source of chemical pollution, which is a major threat to the people living along its banks.

The video documents the pollution of the River Cheetah in South Africa, which is caused by textile factories. The villages near the river are home to a quarter of the population of the region, and many of the inhabitants are young children who are the most vulnerable to the effects of pollution. One man is fighting to change this, and has been surveying the river for evidence of pollution by the textile industry for 17 years.

The video showcases the world's most polluted river, the Tatar River, and the textile factories that discharge their wastewater into it. The factories produce polyester fabric, a synthetic material that requires a lot of chemicals. The wastewater from the factories flows to the river, where it is discharged into the room. The wastewater then flows to the settling tanks, where it is converted into water. The water pipe from the settling tanks is covered with a film of foam, and the company does not want to show the researchers what is happening below the water pipe.

The world's most polluted river is located in Padang, Indonesia. The river is filled with pollutants from factories, including arsenic, nitrates, and mercury. Tests show that the rice crops near the factories are affected, with roots and insects rotting due to the pollution. Kang Yusuf, a rice farmer near a number of factories, tells the documentary crew that the water that irrigates his fields is purple and frothy with pollutants.

The world's most polluted river is the Pan Asia discharge outlet in Indonesia, where waste is dumped at night. Brice Appenzeller, head of the human bio monitoring unit at the Luxembourg Health Institute, speaks to DW about hair analysis compared to blood or urine tests and the importance of long-term samples. The women and children of the village are eager to have their hair analyzed in order to better understand their exposure to pollutants.

The water obtained from a textile factory in Indonesia was found to be polluted with high levels of lead and nonylphenol, chemicals that are used in the textile industry. The water was also found to be unfit for human consumption. The activists from the Association for the Defense of the Environment (AE) contacted the French chemist who was interpreting the pan Asia water analysis, and he stated that the water should not be used for irrigation, washing food, or for farming. Danny, a resident of the area, asked what they could do to use the water anyway because they don't have a choice. The main advice that was given was to boil it and reoxygenate it, decant it, and not drink it.

The video investigates the pollution of a river in Indonesia by textile factories, and how this pollution is impacting humans and the ecosystem. It interviews several major clothing brands that work with Indonesian subcontractors, and finds that the factories are not meeting environmental standards. The video also highlights the work of an independent team that investigated the plant further and found that the levels of nonylphenol and phthalates were below the results of the initial investigation, but that the company had commissioned independent experts to investigate the site in greater depth.

The video discusses the environmental impact of the textile industry and how it is a common problem in countries like Indonesia. Professor Appenzeller shares the results of hair analysis he conducted on children living near textile factories, which shows that they contain high levels of pollutants. However, there is some good news to be found as well: the factory that received the international eco label is working to reduce its environmental impact.
