The video "Kiribati: a drowning paradise in the South Pacific | DW Documentary" highlights the devastating effects of climate change on the residents of Kiribati, a low-lying country in the South Pacific. Rising sea levels and severe tropical storms have caused flooding, forcing families to build seawalls and migrate to other countries. The government has made climate change a national priority and purchased land on Fiji to provide refuge, but lacks the funds for long-term infrastructure measures. Kiribati's residents face challenges in finding solutions to issues such as overpopulation, salinization, and overfishing, but they remain proud and attached to their traditions. There is still hope for Kiribati's future, with efforts being made to protect the coral reefs and find sustainable solutions for clean drinking water and energy.

In this section, the video highlights the effects of climate change on Kiribati, a low-lying country in the South Pacific. Tear Tata and his family, who live on Tarawa Atoll, have been building a coral wall to protect their home from flooding, caused by rising sea levels and severe tropical storms. Kiribati's government has made climate change a national priority, but with more than half its population living on Tarawa Atoll, the country is at risk of being submerged in just 30 years. While the government has purchased land on Fiji to provide the people of Kiribati with refuge, for families like Tear Tata's, defying the rising sea levels has become a symbol of the nation's fight for survival.

In this section, the effects of climate change on Kiribati are discussed, with residents remembering a time before rising sea levels destroyed homes and forced people to travel by boat. While some residents do not hold Western countries accountable for climate change, others are frustrated with their contribution to the issue. To combat erosion and flooding, volunteers plant mangroves in the hopes of creating a barrier against storm surges. Despite the efforts of its people, Kiribati's government lacks the funds for long-term infrastructure measures to protect their nation from the effects of climate change.

In this section, the devastating impact of climate change on the Kiribati islands is explored, with rising sea levels and overpopulation making living conditions increasingly difficult for the island's inhabitants. The documentary features a young entrepreneur from the village of Table Oreo who has built a concrete seawall to protect his home, but with the sea level continuously eroding the land, it is only a temporary solution. The effects of climate change have also led to many Kiribati people to migrate from their homelands, although asylum requests from Kiribati have historically been denied based on climate change. Despite the challenges however, Kiribati's people remain proud and fiercely attached to their traditions.

In this section, we learn about the impact of climate change on the island of Kiribati and the potential loss of culture and home for its residents. Rising sea levels have made it difficult for people to maintain their land and crops, causing migration to other countries. However, some residents remain connected to their homeland and work to find solutions and income sources, such as learning how to make palm sugar and potentially exporting it around the world with the help of government support.

00:20:00
In this section, nutritionist Tonga Fiti Cross teaches Kiribati locals how to cook with local ingredients instead of relying on imported rice and high-sugar foods, which have led to rising rates of obesity and diabetes. She shows them how to use palm leaves for cooking fish, how to cook squash with herbs, and how to use local herbs for medicinal purposes. Tonga Fiti Cross plans to share her knowledge with every village on the island. The environmental protection organization, Kiri-Kan, is also seeking ways to ensure potable water supplies and combat salinization, which is making drinking water salty and unpalatable.

00:25:00
In this section, village representatives in Kiribati present their solutions to the challenge of supplying clean drinking water, with options such as solar pumps, desalination plants, and hand pumps being suggested. The village delegates vote on the proposed solutions, with Australian development aid worker Robert Kane commenting that the process is simply to get people to think about the questions they should be asking when confronted with a new project. The environmental protection organization Kiribati aims to support people in the country in their battle against climate change by providing water tanks and solar panels to generate electricity, and ensuring that people can adapt and stay in their homes and continue with their lives and culture, rather than being forced to move away. The Marine training center is also providing opportunities for young Kiribati residents by offering training to become seafarers, with Kiribati seafarers being in demand, particularly on German vessels.

In this section, we learn about the life of trainee sailors at a training center on Kiribati, which is seen as a pathway to provide for their families and fulfill their dreams. However, the modern complex faces increasingly severe bouts of flooding, indicative of the human-induced changes in ocean currents that have disastrous consequences for the region. Additionally, the primary school in Bond Ricky teaches its students about climate change and its potential impacts, and the children own fears about the future, from washed-away beaches to submerged land, show just how vital it is to confront the issue.

00:35:00
In this section, we see the impact of climate change on the homes and lives of those living in Kiribati. The rising sea levels mean that their homes are being slowly washed away by the ocean, causing palpable fear among the community. However, for some, such as trainee seafarer Tamara and his wife, there is still hope, as he plans to earn a stable income working on a ship, which will enable him to build a better life for his growing family. Meanwhile, fishermen on the island face the challenges of overfishing, with climate change believed to be affecting fish stocks via changes in currents and water temperature. Despite this, coral reefs around Tarawa are adapting to changing temperatures, with the more resilient types of coral thriving.

00:40:00
In this section, we learn that coral reefs are crucial for protecting Kiribati from major storm surges and rising sea levels, but they are under heavy pressure due to factors such as population growth and waste disposal. The government is facing a huge challenge in finding a solution to address this problem, including considering options such as artificial floating islands or reclaiming land by topping it up with sand. However, these solutions require constant development and are difficult to achieve with limited resources. Despite the grim timeline predicted by science, there is still hope, and the people of Kiribati hold onto their pride and the diversity of life that surrounds them.
