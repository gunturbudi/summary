The Renaissance was a time of great accomplishments in art, science, and engineering. Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and other Renaissance artists and scholars made incredible progress in their fields in a short amount of time. Their achievements still resonate today.

In the 1st century AD, the Roman Empire was powerful and successful due to its control of the Western world and its widespread use of slaves. However, this success was built on the backs of millions of slaves, and by the end of the empire, its military machine was no longer able to hold it together. This is where the Renaissance begins- with a desire by the elites of the Roman Empire to revive its past glory, and to do so through the development of art and science. This period of history saw the invention of many groundbreaking technologies, the development of new art forms, and the rise of many great thinkers.

The Renaissance was a time of great innovation and progress, aided by the influx of scholars and artists from the Byzantine Empire (now Turkey). The fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1204 led to a period of conflict and turmoil in the city, which culminated in the Fourth Crusade in 1204. This crusade led to the sack of Constantinople and the eventual subjugation of the Byzantine Empire by the Ottoman Empire. This, in turn, led to the development of the Renaissance.

The revival of ancient ideas, techniques, and sciences during the Renaissance period was due, in part, to the migration of scholars from Constantinople (formerly Byzantium). This exodus reintroduced realism and vitality to Western sculpture and painting, and ancient frescoes provided inspiration to painters. Inventors such as Filippo Brunelleschi developed new machines and construction techniques, while artists such as Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci produced some of the most iconic Renaissance paintings. The rediscovery of perspective drawing was a key factor in the advancement of architecture and art during the Renaissance.

The Renaissance was a time of great change, when the fashionable architects in Italy's competing city-states became some of the top earners. No longer anonymous, they were celebrated and pampered elites. Venice's noblemen spent fortunes on palaces in the new style, and Swiss architect Antonio Contino designed and built the Bridge of Sighs, one of the most photographed motifs in the world. This new style of building became popular outside Italy, and the City Hall in Zurich is a masterpiece of the late Renaissance. A hundred years earlier, the sculptor and builder Anselm Eisenmann had built one of the most picturesque examples of Italian Renaissance architecture, the Lucerne Town Hall. The new style inspired by the buildings of the ancient world was characterized by symmetry and a clear system for the arrangement of columns, arches and domes. Architecture gardens and sculptures were designed as complete artistic ensembles, the aim being to please the eye and please the people. Although it was customary to sign individual works, we often speak of the master of such and such whose name we don't even know in the Renaissance. We see the creators of works being named, art became free from religious motifs, and turning towards everyday life. Extremely self

In 1425, the sculptor Donatello created a statue of David, which was a daring and significant work for its time. Cosimo de Medici, one of the most influential bankers of the time, was the patron who helped finance Donatello's work, as well as the development of art and architecture in Florence. Donatello's fame and status as one of the renaissance's most significant celebrities was due in part to his successful use of double entry bookkeeping, which allowed him to better oversee his finances and understand his assets.

The Renaissance was a time of great change, when people became more aware of their abilities and strengths, and the power of knowledge grew. One of the most important changes during the Renaissance was the invention of the printing press, which made books and other sources of knowledge more accessible to a larger number of people.

The Renaissance was a time of great change, when art, literature, and science flourished. The invention of the printing press and the spread of information helped to create a more free and open society. The most important event during the Renaissance was the Protestant Reformation, which would not have been possible without the increased availability of information.

The Renaissance was a time of great change in art, with painters like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo becoming world-famous earlier than ever before. This newfound fame and confidence allowed for new values such as humility becoming less important. The glass mirror, invented during the Renaissance, allowed people to see themselves clearly for the first time, and this may have contributed to the increased self-confidence of the artists.
