In this section, we follow high school student Karl and see how the lockdown is affecting his daily life. Being confined to his house for over 3 months now, Karl starts his day with 90 minutes of remote English lessons, which he finds difficult to concentrate on due to fatigue. With soccer, meeting friends and even a year abroad to Canada cancelled, Karl is left feeling frustrated about the missed opportunities. Along with his younger brother, Karl's parents do their best to help him cope with the added pressure of lockdown and anxiety on his mental well-being.

In this section, we see two young people, Alena, who is training to become a hotel manager, and Friederike, who is a medical student, talk about how the pandemic has impacted their dreams and hopes. Alena's training has been affected as she can only serve a few business travelers, and the contact with guests she usually enjoys is gone. Friederike had to go through a major exam alone and has lost out on building social connections. The pandemic has also left both of them uncertain about their future and what opportunities will be available to them in their respective industries.

For some, like Karl, it has been a big step backwards as they feel stuck and confined to their homes and villages. Meanwhile, trainee chefs like Alena and Markus are finding ways to learn and gain experience despite limitations, including inviting their bosses and instructors for a dinner event. Online learning has become a challenge for many students like Friederike who miss the structure of in-person classes and must force themselves to stay focused and productive at home.
