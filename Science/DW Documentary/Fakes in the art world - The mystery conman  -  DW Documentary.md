This documentary delves into the world of art forgery and discusses the prevalence of fakes in the market, with up to 50% of antiques sold in auctions being forgeries. The film features experts examining various suspect pieces, including a bronze head from the New York art market, and using scientific methods to determine their authenticity. The experts also highlight the problems with forged art entering museums, with some curators accepting potentially dubious donations from collectors to receive financial contributions. Despite the economic benefits, archaeologists stress the importance of academic responses to protect the integrity of the field.

In this section of the video, archaeologist Stefan Lehmann discusses the work of the mystery forger known as the Spanish Master, who is suspected to be responsible for creating numerous fake sculptures and art pieces in the industry. Lehmann highlights the emotional expression portrayed in these pieces, which is not typical of classical antiquity. He also points out that bronze heads are especially high in demand among art collectors, with some being sold for millions of dollars. Another expert, Christophe Leon, shares his observations about fake pieces in the industry and points out some of the obvious signs of forgery, such as blurriness and unrealistic depictions.

In this section, the documentary explores the presence of forgeries in the art world. In particular, it claims that up to 50% of antiques sold during auctions are fakes. The art trade seems to have made its way to provincial Eastern Germany, where a bronze bust of Alexander the Great was exhibited in the Vinkle Mine museum in 2000. While some experts like Stefan Layman believed it was a masterpiece by a Spanish master, it later emerged that the bust had belonged to the London art dealer Robin Symes and was a fake artwork created by the international art dealer mafia. Despite the accusations, the Winkelman Society sued Layman for libel, and after a lengthy trial, the purported bronze sensation has been missing since the exhibition 10 years ago.

In this section, we see Stephan Lehman, an archaeologist who specializes in identifying forgeries, facing a new case of a Swiss collector who is questioning the authenticity of a bronze head he purchased in New York. If the head is proved to be a forgery, it will be worthless, and with the market for ancient art booming, this reveals a dark world of the potential links between the stock market and the trade in antiquities. While many recognize that the trade is rife with forgeries and looted art, there's a reticence to report or investigate actions. Some museum experts avoid providing opinions altogether, fearing that it might raise the art's value and thus fuel further transactions.

In this section, an art dealer and archaeologist named Christophe Leon shares his insights on the booming market for forgeries in the art world and how he has tried to stay within certain rules of the game to avoid backfiring. Meanwhile, archaeologist Stephan Lehmann from Halle continues to examine a bronze head from the New York art market and uses stylistic analysis to identify genuine works of art by comparing them with originals. Lehmann reveals the market strategies used by alleged forgers, such as the production of bronze sculptures that are known to attract great attention.

In this section, experts examine a suspect bronze head to determine if it is a fake. The piece is analyzed by the Fraunhofer Institute, which specializes in testing materials, and evaluated by art expert, Mira. The team hopes to use a CT scan to see inside the head and find out the method used to produce it. However, the scan reveals strong radiation and makes it difficult to determine the material structure. Meanwhile, Stefan Lehmann discovers several suspect bronze sculptures in France, raising more doubts about the authenticity of many pieces in museums.

In this section, the documentary discusses the problems of forgeries in museums and museums' responsibility to keep them out. The segment shows an expert examining the authenticity of ancient sculptures in a museum, explaining that forensic examination is necessary to determine the authenticity of these exhibits. The documentary also features a person who has assembled a big art collection under pressure, some of which may include forgeries. The segment concludes with the expert explaining that museums should sort through their erroneous purchases and only exhibit the genuine works.

In this section, the Museum of ancient art in Basel is examined for fake sculptures, which were received from a private legacy gift from the Lottery collection in Artin. Stephan Lehmann is suspicious of a bronze sculpture, believed to be the work of the Spanish master, Churriguera, and museum director Andrea B. Nazca sends one of them to a workshop to be examined by conservators. Professor Stefan Lehmann believes that the idea of classical works with no known origin or provenance making their way into public museums via the art market is concerning. Material scientist Harold Miller examines the metal alloy in the bronze sculpture using a PerkinElmer detector with 200 micrometer pixel pitch to determine its age and characteristics.

In this section, experts use scientific methods to expose forgeries in the art market. Mona examines a sculpture and finds that the patina on the head is only on its surface, indicating that it was created in modern times and designed to look ancient. The bronze sculpture of Augustus is also proven to be a fake. Despite the prevalence of forgeries in the art market, authorities are hesitant to regulate it because of its economic benefits. As much as 40 to 50 percent of cultural artifacts and archaeological artifacts on the market may be forgeries. Experts like archaeologist Stephan Lehmann stress the need for strong academic responses to protect the integrity of the field.

In this section, it is revealed that museums in the US often exhibit dubious works of art that are donated by prominent collectors. In most cases, curators will accept these donations, even if they suspect that one or two pieces may be forgeries, in order to continue receiving financial contributions. The lack of provenance and authenticity details surrounding these works creates an opportunity for fraudulent art to be displayed. Art dealer Christoph Lay believes that these forgeries will continue to show up at auctions and that there are likely many more forgeries on display in museums worldwide.
