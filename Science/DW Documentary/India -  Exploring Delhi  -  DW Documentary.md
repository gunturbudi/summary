In this section, we learn that Delhi is a city that has been built by a succession of immigrants, resulting in a stark contrast between its modern glamour and deep-rooted poverty. Rana Das Gupta, a British-Indian novelist, believes that the constant rebuilding of the city has resulted in its coldness and paranoia, despite the amicable nature of its people. However, in the evenings when the temperature has eased, the people of Delhi escape to the lakes and parks before heading straight to the city's entertainment centers. This is a colorful city, bursting with creative and diverse inhabitants, as well as a rich and vivid history.

The poets tackle issues of gender, feminism, and discrimination, while the metal music scene offers a space of individuality for the youth. The dance performance is a practice typically associated with the elite, but now young people are using it to make a name for themselves in society.

In this section of the video, we see a mix of classical culture and modern consumerism at the Kingdom of Dreams entertainment center in Gorgon suburb, where visitors can experience a Bollywood-inspired dance show on stage, and travel through different regions of India on an artificial boulevard. The dream of Bollywood is nurtured by many Indians, and the show lasts for three hours with scene and dance, allowing the audience to enjoy the story of a prince who has to choose between two women. The show has a happy ending to celebrate, gifting the audience with a taste of sweet dreams amidst the harsh and often unjust reality of Delhi's many slums.

In this section of the video "India: Exploring Delhi", the stark contrast between luxury and poverty is highlighted as a slum struggles with water scarcity while a luxurious shopping temple nearby has running water being fired into the air. Residents of the slum only receive water every one or two weeks and have to fetch it from other sources, often coming into conflict with criminal gangs who illegally sell water. The experts call on the government to take action to strengthen the distribution system or create bulk storage points to allow people to create their own user groups. Meanwhile, the farmers who grow their fruit and vegetables along the polluted Yamuna River are very worried about the health risks.

In this section, the video explores the issue of environmental pollution and its impact on the food supply chain, as well as the creative ways people in Delhi are dealing with refuse. Despite the dangers of toxic pollution in the Ganges river, many farmers still believe they are safe by using only groundwater from their wells, but an environmental expert warns that toxins can still be found in the vegetables they grow. Artists are turning scrap containers into amazing graffiti, and Delhi's street art movement is thriving. The video also features the students of JNU, who have been actively opposing the Indian government's Hindu nationalist policies.

In this section, the DW Documentary explores various issues in Delhi, India. One of the main topics discussed is the prevalent issue of smog and air pollution that is causing widespread health problems among the population. Experts are calling for a sustainable policy to combat this issue, including zero tolerance for waste burning and a reduction in the growing dependence on personal vehicles. Additionally, the documentary highlights the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi, which is known for its excellent medical care and free treatment services. However, due to the overwhelming patient load, many people waiting for appointments with doctors may have to wait up to two years.

In this section, the focus is on medical treatments in India, where people come from all over the country and world to receive affordable medical assistance using modern technology. The contrast between private and public medicine in India is pointed out, with some patients disappointed with the basic facilities and lack of resources in public hospitals. The segment then takes a closer look at a private cosmetic surgery center that specializes in gender reassignment surgeries, which are much more affordable than in western countries. While official regulations acknowledge transsexuals as a third sex, discrimination and prejudice against them still exist, as noted by a human rights activist.

In this section, the documentary explores the challenges of accessing healthcare in rural parts of India. The outdated and overcrowded local hospital lacks sufficient beds and doctors with reliable qualifications, leaving those who are seriously ill and poor in a difficult position. To address this issue, high-tech firms have settled on the outskirts of Delhi, offering online consultations with doctors for poor regions subsidized by the state. However, the limitations of technology mean that doctors can only scratch the surface with their remote diagnoses. While telemedicine offers hope, its success depends on improving connectivity in India and providing access to adequate medications, which is often not guaranteed in rural areas.

In this section, the video explores the popularity of beer in Delhi, India, particularly among young people. The Beer Cafe, a modern pub serving German beer, is highlighted along with the owner's explanation for beer's appeal and India's growing beer market. The owner notes that German beer's compliance with ancient purity decrees and the quality of German barley and water contribute to its superiority. The video also makes a comparison between Delhi and beer, noting that some may find it bitter but overall intoxicating.
