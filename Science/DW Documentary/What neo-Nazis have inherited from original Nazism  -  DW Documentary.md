The video discusses the similarities between neo-Nazism and original Nazism, including the prevalence of ethno-nationalism and the belief that the time is ripe for a national transformation. The speaker notes that these similarities are not a coincidence and that we need to be mindful of the dangers of a return to pre-democratic politics.

The video discusses how neo-Nazis have inherited ideas from original Nazism, which included the belief in the racial superiority of Germans and the idea that the individual is nothing compared to the people. These ideas are still present in German fraternities, which serve as a breeding ground for the extreme right.

This video discusses neo-Nazism and how it is similar to original Nazism. Neo-Nazism is a right-wing movement that seeks to create a homogeneous society based on ethnic lines. The video also discusses how traditional political parties are trapped in a multicultural republic and how Tamar Dreifus wants to make the great replacement irreversible.

The video discusses the neo-Nazi movement in Germany, which has been gaining popularity due to dissatisfaction with democracy and ethno-nationalism. According to the video, the AfD is a catch-all for the far right, which survives by whipping up discontent and anger. Many AfD voters have lost faith in the state and political system, but among left-wing voters that figure is 31 percent. Among AfD voters, 41 percent have those same sentiments. This dissatisfaction with the democratic system paired with ethno-nationalism has drawn middle-class voters to the far right.

The video shows how the far-right neo-Nazis have adopted some of the same violent tendencies as their predecessors in the original Nazi movement. The far left, too, has resorted to violence in recent years, but their goals differ: the far left wants to overthrow capitalism while the far right wants to overthrow democracy and human rights.

The video discusses the ideology of the "great replacement," which is a concept that unites right-wing extremists around the world. The video also discusses the christchurch terrorist attack, which was committed by a right-wing extremist who was inspired by the ideology. The video also discusses the identitarian movement, which is a modern form of racism that aims to replace the majority of the native population in a given country with others.

The descendants of people who lived in Germany before World War II are often referred to as "immigrants," and neo-Nazis use this term to refer to people who they perceive as threats to the German people. Neo-Nazis believe that demographic change – primarily the increasing number of Muslim migrants in Germany – is a threat to the German people's existence, and they use racist rhetoric to justify their views.

00:35:00
The AfD, a far-right political party in Germany, is gaining in popularity due to the rise of populism and far-right extremism throughout Europe. The party is made up of socially established voters as well as new voters who are dissatisfied with the current political system. The AfD also capitalizes on protest and attracts people who didn't vote before. There is a clear parallel between the AfD and the former Nazi party, which suggests that not all AfD voters are racist and anti-Semitic.

In this video, DW Documentary discusses how neo-Nazis have been successful in Germany in the current economic climate, despite the fact that unemployment is low and the economy seemingly robust. Social inequality has also grown, and this 40 percent of the population is 32 million people. The trend is that we're seeing a return to the things that led to the downfall of the Weimar Republic, which included social polarization, right-wing extremism, and a state and government that no longer seem to be able to cope.
