# Summary of How our brain judges people in a split second | DW Documentary

This DW Documentary explores how our brains subconsciously judge people within seconds based on their facial features and voice, and how this can lead to biased judgments. While first impressions have been an evolutionary trait for survival, they can also impact real-world consequences, such as the likelihood of winning political positions or getting paid more. The video also discusses how machines, like the Furhat robot, struggle to accurately mimic human behavior and emotions. Additionally, research shows that AI can be biased if the data it has learned from is biased. Understanding the mechanisms of first impressions can allow us to challenge stereotypes and make more informed decisions about the people we meet.

In this section, the video discusses how people judge others in a split second based on their facial features and voice. First impressions are crucial in deciding who we want to communicate with or form close relationships with. These instant decisions are based on learned stereotypes and can lead to biased judgments. However, using a special morphing program, it was found that people generally agree on which faces appear trustworthy or not. This quick decision making based on non-verbal communication is critical for survival and has been an evolutionary trait even before verbal language existed.

In this section, the video explains how our brains use split-second impressions of voices and faces to predict social outcomes and real-world consequences. Faces that appear more competent may have a greater likelihood of winning political positions and attractive people may get paid more. Even the way we hear vocal acoustics play a meaningful role in human perception. The video goes on to show how machines today, such as Furhat, can have a personality with a voice, but it's difficult to transfer human behaviour to machines.

In this section, the DW Documentary explores the challenges faced by researchers trying to program robots with the ability to express emotions and read human body language. While Furhat the robot is excellent at making eye contact and using emotional facial cues, it struggles to express more subtle differences in tone and mimic, making it difficult to react appropriately in all situations. The documentary also examines the science behind micro-expressions and body language and whether it's possible to identify emotions and lies just by observing facial expressions. While it's not quite that easy, the subtle movements in our facial muscles and body language do provide key cues for understanding how we communicate.

In this section, the documentary explores how our brains assess if someone is lying. The video records children's behavior when they are asked to lie and investigates facial expression and vocal cues. The results show that when children are lying, they tend to use a creaky voice and exhibit a tight mouth area. However, not all children show the same cues, and it is not a reliable way to indicate if someone is lying. The documentary also discusses the use of artificial intelligence to assess COVID-19 cases by analyzing vocal cues.

In this section, the transcript excerpt highlights that artificial intelligence is capable of analyzing human voices to detect dysfunction within the body or brain. Additionally, the passage recognizes that people are heavily influenced by the emotions and expressions of others and that successful communication is reliant on nonverbal cues. Finally, the section notes that the voice itself is an intricate and complex signal that requires significant effort to understand.

In this section, we learn how emphasis through tone, pitch and pausing can communicate importance and convert content to acoustic appeal. While the art of public speaking was taught in antiques, it has now become a lost skill. However, we find out that anyone can train their voices with a computer training program to transport information effectively, as shown with a case study where a user almost doubled their previous score. The documentary also revealed that attractive and influential voices are a key aspect of flirting, making snap judgments during one of life's most significant decisions.

In this section, it is explored how humans and primates interpret and react to vocal and facial cues in similar ways. Research shows that even without language, primates process vocal and facial signals the same way humans do. Babies as young as six months old can differentiate between various emotions through facial cues and vocal tone, suggesting that this ability is learned over time. As technology advances, robots like Furhat are being created to study and practice human conversation by analyzing facial and vocal cues of their conversation partners.

In this section, the video discusses the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on our perceptions and biases. The video explains that AI makes decisions based on what it has learned, which can lead to biased actions or decisions if the data it has learned from is biased. Additionally, the video explores how our brains make rapid predictions to provide a rapid response, often leading to adaptive behavior, but also leaving room for subconscious biases and stereotypes. The video suggests that research can provide insight into how these stereotypes are formed and potentially challenge them.

In this section, the researcher shows a test group a range of faces linked to specific character traits. He then pairs an arbitrary facial feature, the width of the nose bridge, with trustworthy behaviors and shows the group completely new faces with varying nose bridge widths. The results show that people are automatically activating these stereotypes, even without their conscious awareness, after just a couple of minutes of learning. While our brains are highly flexible when it comes to stereotyping and learning to evaluate faces differently over the short-term, there is research being done to find a training method that can work long-term. Ultimately, understanding the mechanisms of first impressions can make us less susceptible to being deceived and open us up to discovering more about the people we meet.
