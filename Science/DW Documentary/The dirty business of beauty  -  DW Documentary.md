The documentary explores the business of beauty, focusing on the use of stones and crystals to allegedly improve skin health and relaxation of facial muscles. It interviews both longtime collectors and new fans of the trend, and examines the potential risks and benefits of using these products.

The documentary discusses the growing demand for "crystal stones," which are allegedly used for a variety of purposes such as protection, development of compassion, and opening of the heart chakra. However, many of these stones come from Madagascar, where the conditions for the workers are often very poor. Despite this, the country remains one of the world's top three exporters of precious and semi-precious stones.

This video follows two reporters as they travel to different parts of Madagascar to film a documentary about the mining industry. One reporter, Holly, is accompanied by a Ministry of Communications chaperone, Olivia, who is there to protect her and the reporters' jobs. The reporters quickly realize that it is much harder to do their job without Olivia present, as she makes it much harder for the miners they interview to talk freely. Eventually, they find a way to go to the mines without Olivia, but are worried about what will happen if they get caught. In the end, they go to a coastal town to interview traders and learn more about the mining industry in Madagascar.

The documentary follows an investigative reporting team as they travel to Madagascar to investigate the possible sources of rose quartz, a valuable gemstone. Upon arrival, they are met with resistance from local officials who do not want them to film at the mines where the rose quartz is mined. After several frustrating attempts to gain access to the mines, the team finally finds a working mine and interviews the workers. While the boys who are working in the mine are happy to have visitors, their parents are not so fortunate. Naina, a 15-year-old miner, is interviewed about his difficult life working in the mines and his aspirations to go back to school.

In Madagascar, child labor is common, and many young people, especially in rural areas, must work to help support their families. The documentary discusses the high cost of products in Europe, and how this affects the workers in Madagascar. Many of the laborers interviewed say that they would rather their children not have to work in the mines, but because of poverty, they will have to do so.

In the video, journalists from Europe explore the dirty business of beauty, specifically the mining of rose quartz in Ghana. They meet anjanaya sanjaja, a 21-year-old miner, who tells them that he started mining when he was 17 years old and has been working in the mines for the past few months. The journalists then visit another mine where they observe workers carrying heavy stones and hearing stories of workers getting hurt. They finally meet Phoebe, who sells rose quartz from the last mine they visited. The journalists collect some stones and water to take back to Germany.

The documentary discusses the controversial business of beauty, specifically how rose quartz is obtained and processed. The documentary interviews several people in Madagascar and China, all of whom claim that rose quartz is obtained legally and that the processing is done in responsible, ethical ways. However, the documentary reveals that Chinese suppliers are unwilling to disclose information about the working conditions in the mines where the stones are obtained.

The documentary investigates the issue of child labor in the beauty industry, specifically in the mining of gemstones and minerals. Despite the fact that Undercover revealed that some Chinese suppliers were unwilling to discuss the issue with the filmmakers, they were able to find another supplier in person who was more willing to speak. However, when the filmmakers attempted to ask retailers about working conditions in the mines, they were met with resistance. Although the documentary makes an effort to raise awareness of the issue, it is doubtful that it will have a significant impact on the way retailers operate.

00:40:00
The documentary discusses the issue of global supply chains and how companies can avoid responsibility for the workers in the beginning stages of the supply chain. The documentary also touches on the issue of Germany's new supply chain law, which is designed to increase accountability for companies in the global supply chain.
