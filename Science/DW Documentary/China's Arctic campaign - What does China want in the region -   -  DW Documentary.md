China's interest in the Arctic is driven by a concern for security, resources, and strategic science, which has raised concerns among the region's great powers. China's approach of building scientific knowledge and relationships is seen as a way to increase its presence in the region, and the melting Arctic pack ice presents an alternative shipping route to its trade. China has also attempted to gain a foothold in the Arctic through cooperation and the acquisition of observer status in the Arctic Council. However, suspicions about China's activities in the Arctic have caused a shift in the traditional consensus, which could change the dynamics of the entire region. Additionally, China's interest in supporting Greenland's independence and changing the power dynamics in the Arctic has raised concerns.

Detail Summary:

In this section, it is explained that China's interest in the Arctic started as a result of their need for developing trade routes through the Belt and Road Initiative which extends to the polar region. Their participation in Arctic affairs has raised concern among Arctic's great powers, who aren't sure what China is really after. While China claims to be a near-Arctic state, Beijing's true ambitions remain unclear. China's interest in the Arctic is driven by a concern for security, resources, and strategic science. The climate argument allowed China to gain international approval for its position.

In this section, it is explained how China's focus on scientific cooperation helped them avoid tensions with major players in the Arctic region such as Russia, the US, Canada, Denmark, and Norway. The Polar Research Institute of China was founded in 1989 to assert China's scientific legitimacy and explore the Arctic through sea-based exploration, facilitated by their purchase of the icebreaker Xue Long in the early 1990s. China also established the Yellow River Station base in Svalbard in 2003, through a long-forgotten treaty that provided them access to the Arctic. This approach of building scientific knowledge and relationships is seen as a way to increase China's presence in the region.

In this section, the video discusses China's shipping needs and the potential benefits of the Arctic region to its trade. With much of Chinese trade and oil imports passing through the South China Sea, China dislikes the US's dominance policing the shipping lanes. The melting Arctic pack ice presents an alternative in the form of three shipping routes; the Northeast Passage seems the most promising, running along Russia's coast over Kirkenes, the closest European port to Asia. The section also describes how Norwegian entrepreneur Ola Giaever introduced billionaire Huang Nubo to the Arctic, who then expresses interest in buying and building on Giaever's million-square-meter property in the area.

In this section, the documentary examines how China tried once again to gain a foothold in the Arctic via Iceland, a small island country that had been shaken by a financial crisis. A Chinese billionaire investor secured 300-square kilometers in the north of the island to erect a tourist complex there. However, the project was met with backlash from Icelanders who feared that it could be used as a military base for China. Eventually, Iceland’s then-Interior Minister stopped the project. Despite the setback, China and Iceland's alliance was sealed in 2013 when Iceland became the first European country to sign a free trade agreement with China. The ship Xue Long was used as a kind of floating embassy.

In this section, we learn about China's campaign to become a legitimate player in the Arctic through cooperation and the acquisition of observer status in the Arctic Council. Despite initial suspicions from Arctic states, including major powers such as Russia and the USA, China's observer status was granted with the help of countries like Iceland and the fear that denying China a role in the Arctic Council could lead to retaliatory actions. With observer status, China is able to build coalitions and influence decisions in the Council, furthering their presence in the Arctic.

In this section, the video explains how China and Russia's relationship became closer after the West imposed sanctions following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Both China and Russia were looking to further their own interests and quickly set aside any remaining reservations they had about each other. China's interest in the Arctic was largely based on contributing something that would help the rest of the world, particularly in terms of energy. Yamal LNG, a liquefied natural gas project in the Russian Arctic, offered China a unique opportunity to establish a large and lasting presence in the far North, with Chinese firms assuming control of 30% of the project. Russia's image as an Arctic superpower has been dealt a blow, and some experts worry about a one-sided dependency on China, but others believe that China is not a threat and is simply part of a big East Asian family.

In this section, we learn about China's involvement in the Arctic and its plans for the region. China has been expanding its sphere of influence and investing in natural resources, such as liquefied natural gas, and infrastructure projects, such as constructing its own icebreakers. While the country's ambition in the Arctic is significant, it remains secretive about its plans and intentions. However, a white paper outlining China's policy in the Arctic was presented in 2018, which mainly addressed the country's Polar Silk Road project and plans to exploit natural resources in the Arctic, but did not mention any military or strategic interests.

In this section, concerns are raised about China’s Arctic research stations and the potential lethal uses of the laser they are installing in their observatory. The increasing suspicions of China’s activities in the Arctic caused a shift in the traditional consensus of the Arctic Council's Ministerial Meeting in May 2019, which changed the dynamics of the entire region. Nevertheless, China emphasized its interest in industrial and economic investments in the Arctic, withdrawing from the Alaska LNG project after its conflict with the United States’ Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The future of the Arctic's development might depend on the West's engagement level, and Greenland is the perfect example of conflicts of interest between China, Denmark, and the US due to its extensive mineral reserves.

In this section, the focus is on China's interest in supporting Greenland's independence and changing the power dynamics in the Arctic. The Kuannersuit mining project is an emblematic example of this shift as China already has a monopoly on rare earth metals essential for green energy technologies. The partly state-owned Chinese company's stake in the project would end China's monopoly, but the development of the mine could take decades. China is patient in playing the waiting game as other countries do not make the most of their time. However, the young Inuit shepherd who lives near the mine site is against it as it would pollute his pastures, and the community party that spoke out against the mine emerged victorious in the April 2021 elections in Greenland.
