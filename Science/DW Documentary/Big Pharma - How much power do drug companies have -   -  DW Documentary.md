Detail Summary:

The pharmaceutical industry is incredibly powerful, with its ability to dictate government health policies largely unchecked. Martin Shkreli, former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, is responsible for hiking the price of a drug by 5,000%. He is also on the world health organization's list of essential medicines.

The video discusses the life and career of notorious businessman, investor, and convicted fraudster Martin Shkreli. After being arrested and convicted of securities fraud, Shkreli became the face of the excesses of the pharmaceutical industry and its cynical attitude towards customers and regulators. The price of a drug Shkreli had acquired in the past, Daraprim, has never returned to its original level, and some have blamed Shkreli's actions for a number of health problems faced by patients taking the drug.

The video documents the story of Marine Marta, a whistleblower who filed a complaint against Sanofi after becoming aware of the side effects of their drug Depokine. Marine Marta's advocacy group, Les Victimes de Sanofi, has since gathered thousands of members from across Europe who have suffered from birth defects and mental impairment as a result of taking the drug during pregnancy. While Sanofi has since agreed to an interview with the group, they have refused to discuss the ongoing legal proceedings in the cases of Marine Marta and other victims associations in Europe.

The video discusses the history of depakine, a drug that can harm an unborn baby when taken during pregnancy. The patient package insert for sanofi now includes very clear warnings in all languages about the risks of exposure to the drug during pregnancy. The video also discusses the Volkswagen dieselgate scandal, in which the government was deemed responsible for the defects in Volkswagen cars, but the main responsibility lies with the manufacturer. Only after a two-year battle was marine marta able to ensure a warning would be affixed on the depokeen label.

This video discusses how pharmaceutical companies have influence over doctors, and how this can result in expensive treatments being prescribed for less serious conditions. The video also discusses how a cheaper, alternative treatment was developed that was equally effective but cheaper.

00:25:00
The video discusses the power of drug companies and their influence on the medical field. It focuses specifically on the case of Lucentis, which was a licensed treatment until two months before it was discontinued due to pressure from Novartis. The video explains that the cheaper alternative, which was equally effective, was rarely used due to lobbying by the pharmaceutical industry. In the US, drug prices are completely unregulated and change every time the FDA approves a new drug. Despite repeated attempts by elected officials to lower the cost of new treatments, the pharmaceutical companies have consistently managed to profit.

00:30:00
The video discusses how Big Pharma, specifically Gilead Sciences, has a lot of power and how they are able to set high prices for their medications. In particular, Gilead Sciences was able to lower the price of their medication in France by introducing generic versions and giving the pharma lab assurances that they would open major markets.

00:35:00
The video discusses how the price of drugs has outstripped the actual cost of research, with the appearance of new gene therapies causing prices to increase even further. It also discusses how the pharmaceutical industry has shifted its focus from innovation to price, with the largest drug companies increasingly charging hundreds of thousands of euros for a year's treatment. This business model is cruel to patients who can't afford to pay, and is detrimental to the development of new, life-saving treatments.

00:40:00
The video discusses how drug companies have a lot of power and are able to set prices high, even if it is not in the best interest of patients. This conflicts of interest is a major issue and needs to be addressed.
