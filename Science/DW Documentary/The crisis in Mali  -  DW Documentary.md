The crisis in Mali began in 2012 when jihadists gained control of the northern region of the country, leading to French and European intervention with Operation Serval. However, since the end of Serval, terrorists have only advanced, leading to a military deadlock and significant inter-communal violence. Corruption, drug trafficking, and religious radicalization contributed to the crisis, as well as the failure of Mali's military to intervene. The violence has since spread beyond Mali's borders, affecting neighboring countries, and the French government is now planning to adapt its military presence by ending Operation Barkhane and offering aid and support to national armies. However, the crisis has already displaced over two million people and resulted in numerous civilian casualties.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
In this section, we learn that Mali has become the epicenter of jihadist terror in the Sahel region, and France and its European allies are currently fighting a war in the country. In 2012, jihadists gained control of northern Mali, shocking the international community. The French-led Operation Serval liberated occupied towns but the crisis intensified, and since the end of Serval, terrorists have only advanced, making great strides everywhere. This failure has become a breeding ground for jihadists and has led to a military dead end. The Malian crisis is a story of failure for the state, but also of the international community, and the crisis has led to significant inter-communal violence. The roots of the disaster are traced back to Algeria, which plunged into civil war in the 1990s, and the Algerian jihadists of the GSPC then crossed the border into northern Mali.

In this section, it is revealed that Mali had become a sanctuary for the GSPC, which would later become part of al-Qaida. Northern Mali became an area of interest for these jihadist groups, and the government was not aware of the dangers that they represented. Meanwhile, the country was also struggling with trafficking drugs from South America, which led to political groups taking drug money and disrupted the economy, having a significant impact on the disintegration of the state. Despite Mali's troubled waters, the international community continued to see it as a model of democracy in Africa and continued supporting President Amadou Toumani Touré. However, many officials were involved in corruption, which proved to be a significant issue.

In this section, the documentary examines how religion became a moral refuge in Mali, but the arrival of Pakistani preachers from the Tablighi Jamaat movement paved the way for a step towards radicalization. Disoriented young people became adherents of jihadism and pledged allegiance to al-Qaida. The crisis in Mali was further fueled by the NATO-led Operation Harmattan, which saw Gaddafi relinquish power and weapons, and the Tuareg fighters returned to Mali with their weapons. The Tuaregs led rebellions, and the younger generation revived the autonomy movement and set up the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), but Iyad Ag Ghaly wanted to take political leadership, leading to the formation of his own movement, Ansar Dine.

In this section, the documentary explains the third act of the Malian crisis, in which an unlikely alliance had formed between the Tuareg independence fighters of the MNLA and the jihadists of Ansar Dine, Iyad Ag Ghaly, AQIM and the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa, leading to the toppling of major northern cities of Timbuktu, Gao, and Kidal. The Malian army was unable to defend such a vast and inhospitable territory, and President Amadou Toumani Touré was toppled by a military coup. However, the chaos escalated and the jihadist occupation led to cutting off of hands, executing people, chastising heads of families or women in public, and attacks against monuments and women.

00:20:00
In this section, we see the aftermath of the Malian crisis, following the failure of Mali's military to intervene, leading to brutal physical violence, especially against women. The French government hesitated to intervene, as they did not have the legal or political capacity to do so, perceiving this as a matter that involved Africans. The intelligence service indicated that the terrorists had weakened, thereby creating an opportunity for the international community to help in organizing and rebuilding. But Europe and the world's attention was mainly on establishing order and electing a new president instead of helping the people of Mali during the lull. The French military became stuck in a dead end without the necessary political support to resolve the crisis.

00:25:00
In this section, the documentary showcases the violent conflicts between the Fulani herders and Dogon farmers in Mali. These ethnic groups were able to coexist peacefully for a long time, but with environmental degradation, tensions rose, leading to massacres on both sides. The Malian state was unable to stop the violence, and both groups resorted to reprisals against each other. Despite the international community’s billions of dollars in aid towards development, little has changed for the people of Mali as most live in destitute conditions with no job prospects. Meanwhile, the few organizations that have been established with Western funds only support the many people who work for them, with little impact on the Malian people.

00:30:00
In this section, the video discusses the issue of corruption in Mali, where some officials have accumulated vast riches while the country remains one of the poorest in the world. Audits have revealed embezzlement of public funds, nepotism, and influence peddling, but international organizations and foreign governments have done little to stop it. Meanwhile, young activists like Adam Dicko are organizing to demand better governance and an end to corruption, while the religious leader Imam Mahmoud Dicko has become a popular figure by using his moral authority to denounce corruption and promote conservative Islamic values. However, this mixing of religion and politics has raised concerns about the country's secularism and the potential misuse of religious influence for political purposes.

00:35:00
In this section, we learn about the rise of radical Islamic jihadist groups in Mali who are seeking to Islamize the country and implement Sharia law. Despite the French military presence in the region, the two organizations, "Islam and Muslim Support Group" and "Islamic State in the Greater Sahara", have been able to spread their influence across a large part of Mali, resulting in the closure of thousands of schools and threatening the education of future generations. The French presence is viewed by some as an occupation, further complicating the country's security situation. The population's main desire is to live in safety and security, which they feel is yet to be achieved.

00:40:00
In this section, the French government announces its plan to adapt its military presence in the Sahel by ending Operation Barkhane and offering aid, support, and cooperation to national armies of countries that desire it. France is relying on a European alliance to find a way out of the crisis in Mali. However, the crisis has already spread beyond its borders, affecting Burkina Faso, Niger, and even the coastal states. The increasing number of civilian victims of the crisis is being forgotten, with more than two million people having fled and settling in no-man’s land to survive.
