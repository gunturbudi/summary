In this section, the documentary explores the online propaganda battle between Russia and Ukraine during the conflict in Ukraine. While Russia has a top-down approach to communication, Ukraine has a more grassroots approach with many voices reporting on the war. Spin doctors from both sides carefully orchestrate strategic communication. The Ukrainian president, Vladimir Zelensky, brought in additional support for his communication team, including Alexi Aristovich, who doubles as an influencer and has helped people digest the shock during the first days of the war. The propaganda war in Ukraine is fought in real-time via social media, making it the first war of its kind.

In this section, we see how a psychotherapist named Aristowicz becomes a popular figure in Ukraine as he tries to provide a sense of normality and control to the traumatized audience amidst the propaganda war. He wears unusual clothes for a governmental official but acquires audiences all over the world by mediating and communicating the message from the Office of the President of Ukraine. On the other hand, Vladimir Soloviov, Putin's chief propagandist, becomes an ever-present mouthpiece for the Kremlin as he delivers his message through TV talk shows and his Telegram channel. He declares that Russia will protect the people's republics of Donetsk and Lujansk while mocking Berlin's lack of protection, repeating what Putin was saying earlier that day.

00:10:00
In this section, the video describes how Russia is using propaganda to justify its military operations in Ukraine. Russian media outlets, such as Rossia 24, parrot Putin's words and phrases about the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine. The video also discusses Putin's use of history as a weapon to support his narrative of restoring Russia's lost empire, and the role of Putin's experience as a gangster in shaping his tactics of scaring people with violence and fear. Meanwhile, Ukraine's President Zelensky is criticized for abandoning the country and hiding in the American embassy. The video points out that with the prison threat of up to 15 years for saying the wrong thing, Russia is not a bastion of free speech.

00:15:00
In this section, we see the power of social media in shaping public perception during the war in Ukraine. A video from the President's team, featuring a shift in aesthetic from selfie-style to presidential address, went viral and created a sense of unity and solidarity among the people. The video marked the President's efforts to improve his relationship with the press and serves as an example of the propaganda war being waged online in Ukraine.

00:20:00
In this section, the documentary highlights the power of social media influencers in shaping the propaganda war for Ukraine. Telegram, the most popular messaging app in Ukraine, is used by Ukrainians to disseminate news of the war, warnings, and appeals for support, and Instagram is used to share information about the war. Russian opposition activist Mark Fagin and Ukrainian military adviser Alexia Aristovich have a cult following in their YouTube talk show that was launched when the war broke out. Aristovich, who is well known in Ukraine and appears in Telegram with almost 450,000 followers, is described as a "homeschooled philosopher" who talks about literature, politics, and even military action. He uses memes and pop culture references in his content to transcend borders and appeal to people who go online.

00:25:00
In this section, the documentary explores the impact of propaganda on the younger generation, who use reference systems to make sense of the war in Eastern Ukraine. They cite a frighteningly accurate prediction in 2019 by Mikhail Pogrebinsky, that the price of Ukraine applying to join NATO would be war with Russia. They also highlight an example of Russian disinformation, where footage of war crimes committed by Russian forces in Butcha collides directly with Russian propaganda, leading to widespread international condemnation and accusations of genocide.

00:30:00
In this section, the propaganda war between Russia and Ukraine is discussed, where both sides accuse each other of fabricating the truth. Russia demonizes Ukrainians by portraying them as Nazis who are willing to resort to any level to tarnish the image of Russia. Further, the word "fake" does not exist in Russian, making everything from them truth and everything said against them false. The propaganda perpetuates the message that force is the only language powerful nations understand, which contributes to a cult of brute force in Russia. The section also features footage of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

00:35:00
In this section, we see the perspective of Maria Avdeva, a lawyer and political scientist turned reporter during the Ukrainian war. Through her Twitter diary, she is able to share the firsthand accounts of the residents of Kharkiv after experiencing the bombardment from Russian missiles. The grassroots network is not orchestrated from above but rather is Maria's own creation with the goal of documenting the situation and holding the responsible parties accountable. She believes that by establishing what happened and who is responsible, it could help ease some of the pain of the people affected by these crimes.

00:40:00
In this section, the transcript excerpt highlights the shift in opinion of Putin's propagandist, Vladimir Salioviov, towards Ukraine. In 2013, he expressed pro-Ukrainian views and believed that a war with them would be unimaginable, but by 2015, he embraced the annexation of Crimea as a reality. The entire media system in Russia has gradually come under state control, with Russia ranking 150th out of 180 on the World Press Freedom index. Despite this, even Dutch journalists find it hard to dislike presenters for Russian State television. The audience's resentment is crucial to understanding what Russians feel when they watch these shows as they already feel victimized and justified in conducting the war.

00:45:00
In this section, we see the experiences of Tatiana Ulyanova, a Russian reporter who was sent to Ukraine's Eastern Donbass in 2014 to cover the conflict. Ulyanova, who had doubts about her job and the propaganda being spread, eventually posted photos on social media of the destruction in Hacive and a Ukrainian violinist playing in a bunker. She was later fired for "extremist posts," and eventually left the country with her husband. We also see examples of the propaganda being spread, particularly in the case of the alleged bombing of a maternity clinic, which was later debunked as fake news.

00:50:00
In this section, the documentary explores the propaganda war in Ukraine and how President Zelensky and his wife are using various channels of communication to counteract the waning of empathy and attention towards the prolonged war. Zelensky's communication style is described as populist, with a focus on attacking the Ukrainian establishment. His wife, Olena, uses her Instagram channel to communicate with people affected by the war. However, the Ukrainian media landscape is not without its weaknesses and is criticized for being controlled by oligarchs. The documentary suggests that, despite the criticisms, Zelensky's persistence in protecting his people is delivered out of desperation and necessity.

00:55:00
In this section, the propaganda wars between Ukraine and Russia are explored. While Russia celebrates Victory Day with a military parade, Ukraine emphasizes that the atrocities of the past, such as the Nazi occupation, should never happen again. Zelensky's message is about ending the war and not glorifying the Ukrainian army, which is in stark contrast to Russia's welcoming attitude towards war. Meanwhile, young Ukrainians use social media platforms like TikTok to document their experiences and lives amidst the conflict.

01:00:00
In this section, the documentary explores how social media platform TikTok is used by young Ukrainians to offer glimpses of their everyday lives during wartime, but also to communicate and process the pain and fear they feel. The "TikTokization" of the war has made it instantly available to a global audience through real-time war diaries that express what young people are feeling and experiencing in the war. The documentary also features a popular influencer who began posting war-related content on TikTok, which has gained millions of views.

01:05:00
In this section, the use of narrative structures by social media users is discussed as a way to respond to the propaganda war in Ukraine. The young Ukrainians are using irony and sarcasm to combat the absurdity and incomprehensibility of the war. Additionally, a journalist who researched the phenomenon of paid internet trolls went undercover in Putin's cyber troops and found that even traditional propaganda is looking for new outlets. Putin's youth movement is rising to the challenge and using cyberfront Z as a network of volunteers to combat disinformation online, following the success of Ukrainian grassroots messaging. Payment is also discussed, with the trolls getting paid to attack anyone who criticizes the Kremlin online.

01:10:00
In this section, the DW Documentary explores the propaganda war for Ukraine. The documentary reveals that there was a fear that bots and fake news would clog up all channels during the Cyber War, but the few that appeared were quickly debunked. In addition, the video highlights the experience of alleged Ukrainian assassins who were caught plotting to harm a famous Russian TV journalist, Vladimir Solovyov, reinforcing the claim that Ukraine is controlled by Nazis. The documentary suggests that Putin's propaganda machines have one main message: everybody lies, including them, and that is how humans communicate with each other.

01:15:00
In this section, the video explores how disinformation and propaganda are spread about secret biological weapons labs in Ukraine. Starting with the case of former Georgian security minister Igor Gilgaxer posting classified records online, the video points out how Russia has long lied about biological weapons, and the claim of Ukraine having secret bioweapons labs was little more than disinformation to justify invading the country. The video shows how these fake stories could destabilize audiences and generate fear and worries, which were probably the major effect of that particular fake. The video highlights how propaganda and disinformation are tools that can fuel conflicts and misunderstandings.

In this section, the documentary highlights the propaganda war in Ukraine that includes the selective release of information, deliberate disinformation, and brutal violence used by Russia as a tool to convince Ukrainians to comply with their demands. The trauma of the second world war still lingers in Ukraine, leading to a wartime mode of communication and media. The Russian propaganda machine is spreading lies about Ukraine, and Putin's team is preparing young people for war. The propaganda war is seen as crucial to both sides, and it is yet to be known who will come out on top.
