"The World of Meat Substitutes" is a DW documentary that explores the environmental impact of meat production and how meat substitutes are increasingly being developed to fight climate change, promote animal welfare, and address food insecurity. The documentary presents insights from experts in the field, as well as demonstrations of different techniques used to make plant-based meat substitutes and cell-based meat. The video also examines the challenges and opportunities in developing these alternatives to traditional meat, and the need for multifaceted solutions to address climate change.

In this section, Cynthia Rosenzweig, a senior research scientist at NASA and lead author of the food security chapter in the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land, discusses the impact of the food system on greenhouse gas emissions. According to Rosenzweig, the food system, from clearing land for agriculture to retail, is responsible for one-third of total greenhouse gas emissions, and many of these emissions come from the stomachs of animals. Enteric fermentation in ruminants like cows produces the belching of methane, which has a 28 times greater effect on warming than CO2. To meet the Paris goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees, Rosenzweig suggests that we need to change our eating habits radically.

In this section, the video explores the impact of meat on the environment and climate change. Livestock, particularly cows, emit carbon dioxide and methane, which are major contributors to greenhouse gases. Additionally, clearing forests and draining peat boxes for agricultural use result in further emissions. Researchers suggest that reducing meat consumption could significantly decrease greenhouse gas emissions, with estimates ranging from 4 to 8 billion tons of CO2 annually. Furthermore, reducing reliance on meat production can also free up land for reforestation and carbon sequestration. While dietary choices can make a significant difference, the video also acknowledges that many people may not have the luxury of choosing their diet.

In this section, the documentary explores how meat substitutes are made, where plant protein is combined with other raw materials to recreate the texture, taste, and appearance of meat products. By using pea protein instead of soy or wheat, for example, and other techniques such as texturizing, plant protein can be transformed into meat substitutes with the similar umami flavors typical of meat. Despite the potential benefits of meat substitutes in the fight against climate change and animal welfare, the increasing production of plant-based protein also has consequences for the environment, such as clear-cutting rainforests to create space to grow it.

In this section, the DW Documentary delves into the high-tech world of meat substitutes, such as the impossible burger. The burger is the result of an investment of around $2 billion, and its development involved breaking down the molecular level of meat. Taste and smell are key factors that differentiate between different meat products, and to tackle the challenge of making the burger taste like real beef, researchers inserted DNA extracted from soy roots into yeast, which was then fermented and produced heme. This little hint of blood and the flavors that emerge during heating are the secret of the taste of real meat, according to the study's lead researcher.

In this section, the documentary discusses how some companies are attempting to manufacture real meat. Some of these companies are using a process where meat is no more than animal tissue that is made up of billions of individual cells. These cells have the potential to divide and multiply exponentially, even outside of an animal body. By taking cells from an animal, making them immortal, and allowing them to keep growing, companies can produce whatever they want to eat. The founder of Future Meat, one of the companies that's closest to achieving this, has developed a system where cells are grown in a tank, and muscle cells grow in one tank, while fat cells grow in another tank. The cells are grown in a temperature-controlled environment, and the temperature is kept constant at 37 degrees Celsius.

In this section, we see a demonstration of a lamb kebab made with plant-based meat using the my yard reaction, a process that combines DNA, proteins, and lipids to create aromatic compounds critical to the flavor and texture of meat. Jacob Nemeus, a representative of the meat substitute industry, believes that replacing all farms with these methods is a planetary revolution that needs to happen everywhere. However, investigative journalist Joe Fassler argues that scaling this production process to feed the world would require large, clean facilities that are currently difficult and expensive to maintain. He believes that if we don't change the rules of biology, this problem will remain unsolvable.

In this section, the challenges of producing cell-based meats are discussed, such as the difficulty of maintaining aseptic conditions in larger facilities and the high cost of smaller, cleaner facilities. Reports and studies show that multiple advancements are needed to overcome these obstacles, and while some industry experts are confident in their solvability, the possibility of the investment bubble bursting remains uncertain. However, companies such as Future Meat have received significant investments from major industry players like Tyson Foods, indicating a growing interest in developing alternatives to traditional meat production. Ultimately, the urgency of addressing climate change requires a multifaceted approach that extends beyond technological advancements.
