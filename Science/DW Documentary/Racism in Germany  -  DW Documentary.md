In this section, the video discusses how being German is often equated with being white, and individuals who are not white are not considered to have the same right to be part of society as white people. However, this perception is challenged by the long history of Black people living in Germany, which dates back to the late 19th century when Africans arrived in the country for various reasons. This history also includes Germany's colonial period, where Germans profited from the slave trade and committed a genocide in Namibia in 1904. The video highlights the importance of acknowledging this history and recognizing the contributions of Black Germans to German society.

In this section, the documentary explores the process of racial degradation of Africans and the staged spectacle of putting them on display, often with their families, as part of Germany’s colonial adventure. The Germans wanted to portray Africans as less civilized and less developed, and as animalistic, to legitimize their "civilizing mission." While the German administration needed specialized personnel, craftsmen, translators, and other groups, African men were drawn from the African elite, and young Africans were brought over for training. The documentary also mentions the story of Mandenga Diek, who came to Hamburg from Douala, Cameroon, to complete an apprenticeship as a shoemaker, eventually becoming a respected Afro-German merchant. The documentary notes the first state-organized exhibition in Germany took place in Berlin, where Africans were racially degraded and made to appear primitive to justify colonization to the German population.

In this section, the documentary discusses the history of resistance and activism by Black people in Germany. In 1919, Germany's first Black train driver, Martin Dibobe, and other people of African descent signed a petition for equal rights, including the recognition of marriages between Black men and white women and the opportunity for young Africans to attend university. Although the petition failed, it marked the dawn of the first Black movement in Germany, and events are remembered on a commemorative pillar in downtown Berlin. However, the Nazi era brought new challenges, including the stripping of colonial migrants' citizenship and statelessness for Theodor Wonja Michael, a Black German who was exploited as a child performer in various human zoos and as an extra in films that degraded Black people and promoted the Nazis' white supremacy ideology.

In this section, the DW Documentary explores the racism that the Afro-German community faced during and after the Nazi era. They were frequently portrayed as "savages" in German colonial films, and after the Nazis came to power, they were persecuted and forced to go into hiding. The Nazis aimed to eradicate the Afro-German community and prevent another generation of Black people in Germany. After the war, many biracial children were born, and while some were given up for adoption or subjected to "anthropological research", others lived in Germany and faced discrimination and racism. Even today, some of them still suffer from the racist remarks made to them as children.

In this section, the experiences of Erwin Kostedde, a Black football player, and Gabriela Willbold, a woman of mixed-race, are shared. Erwin Kostedde faced racist chants from rival football fans and was even wrongly accused of a crime because of his skin color, despite being celebrated by the media as an outsider with a racial nickname. Despite being born to a Ghanaian father and being visibly different from the other children at school, Gabriela Willbold learned from an early age that being different was not something discussed or important at home. The East German government recruited workers from fellow-communist countries, but there was no vision for their social integration and they were not supposed to assimilate.

In this section, the experiences of two Black women, Gabriela Willbold and Abenaa Adomako, growing up in Germany during the 1980s and 90s are discussed. Willbold faced discrimination and limitations in her medical career due to her skin color but was eventually able to become a gynecologist. On the other hand, Adomako faced blatant racism when trying to find an apprenticeship as an optician. Both women found solace in a group of Black German women that were brought together by the African-American poet and activist Audre Lorde. This community allowed them to connect with others who had similar experiences and develop a positive self-image. Lorde also encouraged them to self-identify as "Afro-Germans" or Black Germans.

In this section, the video discusses the rise of the second Black movement in Germany, which included the founding of the Initiative of Black People in Germany and ADEFRA for Black women. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 brought hope for a better life, but just over a year after reunification, neo-Nazis in Eberswalde attacked and killed a young African contract worker named Amadeu Antonio. Jone Mununga, who had also come to East Germany from Angola, felt a sense of terror and war-like atmosphere during that time. Konrad Erben, who grew up in Jena during the 90s, was also aware of the looming danger of neo-Nazism in his neighborhood. While routine violence may have subsided, racism in Germany persisted.

In this section, the documentary explores the experiences of Black individuals in Germany and how they have been affected by racism. The documentary features the story of Konrad Erben who was racially harassed and how he founded a local branch of a civil rights group for Black people. The film also narrates the experiences of Aminata Touré, who became the first Afro-German deputy speaker of a regional parliament and state minister, and how she tackled structural racism in public institutions and society. Furthermore, the documentary highlights the importance of creating a space for retreat and empowerment to recharge batteries and immerse oneself in another world to combat racism.

In this section, an Afro-German family discusses the challenges they face to fully integrate into German society. The family spans several generations and emphasizes their German heritage, yet are still questioned about their roots and status as German citizens. They acknowledge the progress that has been made but vow to continue pushing toward equality and acceptance in a society that is not always welcoming.
