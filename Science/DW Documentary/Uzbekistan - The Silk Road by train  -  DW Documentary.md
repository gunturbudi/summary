The video follows a journey train through Uzbekistan, from the capital Tashkent to the former shores of the Aral Sea. The train is a lifeline for the 33 million inhabitants of Uzbekistan, and even though the road network is poor, most people just take the train. In the 1970s, several dams were built on the slopes of the Tian Shan Mountains, which still fullfill Tashkent's water needs today. But there's not just water in these mountains... Hidden deep within them is a secret that the Soviet Union guarded for decades. In the 1940s, uranium was discovered here, and for the miners, a top-secret city was built out of the ground. Today, it looks like a ghost town. One of the last inhabitants of Yangiobod is Marat Enikeev, who was one of the first people born here 67 years ago. Every morning he makes his rounds.

This video documents the decline and eventual closure of a Silk Road-era railway station in Uzbekistan, which has had a significant impact on the local community. The station has been a source of pride for the local residents, but with no work available and few family members left, life is lonely and difficult. Boxing has become a means of self-expression for the local youth, and the Olympic team training there is struggling to keep up with the demands of competition.

The video follows two Uzbekistani police officers, Fatima and Zukhra, as they patrol the Registan Square in the city of Samarkand. The twins recount how it was a dream of their childhood to become police officers, and explain how their parents gave them a good life. The officers note that life was difficult for devout Muslims during Soviet times, but today there are 2000 mosques in Uzbekistan and new ones are still being built. The muezzin, or person responsible for calling Muslims to prayer, Abdugani, is also responsible for the care of the tombs in the Samarkand necropolis. The most important site in the complex is the tomb of Abbas, who is said to have brought Islam to Samarkand. The video ends with the twins and their grandmother celebrating a family celebration.

The two speleologists Vladimir Dolgiy and Pavel Baer journey deep into the Hissar Mountains in Uzbekistan to explore a great secret - the location of Timur's palace. After 18 hours of difficult hiking, they find the cave and make their way down to the Timur Fortresses, where they discover that the legend of Timur's hiding place may have been true after all. However, the route to the cave is long and difficult, and they have to be careful not to come across any bears or leopards. Once they reach the cave, they have to prepare for the cold temperatures inside. They explore as much as possible and find that the cave was likely suitable for sheltering an army. However, without drinking water, the speleologists would not be able to survive. In the end, they return to their campsite exhausted but satisfied with their discoveries.

The video interviews a number of people in Uzbekistan about their history and culture. It is unclear if Timur, the 13th century ruler of an enormous empire, was ever in the cave, but it remains a mystery. The train journey continues westward, passing through the ancient city of Bukhara. The residents there discuss the city's significance on the Silk Road and the dwindling number of Jews who live there. At the end of the video, the interviewer interviews the grandson of a Jewish watchmaker who has been in business for generations.

The video follows a train as it travels through the Kyzylkum Desert in Uzbekistan, which is home to the last Jews in the city of Bukhara. The community members discuss their plans to leave Uzbekistan for Israel or the US, citing economic reasons as their main concern. Despite the heat and the difficult working conditions, tea remains the most important part of their culture.

This video documents the process of milking camels in Uzbekistan. The camels are left to roam free and the father can't see them, so the eldest son, Qalimjon, is supposed to search for them. The first thing that needs to be done is to drink from the mother and then the teats swell so that milk can be milked. Mother Salikha has years of experience and Nazerke is anxious, but eventually it all works. The first bucket of milk is finally full and most of the time the milk is sold at the market, but when they are invited somewhere, for example to a wedding, they like to bring the milk as a wedding gift.

The video follows a train journey from Uzbekistan to the former Aral Sea port city of Muynak, which has now largely been eroded away by the sandstorms. The train driver, a married father of a young son, tells of his life and work as a train driver, and of the efforts being made to preserve the environment.

This video documents the transformation of the Aral Sea, formerly the largest inland body of water in the world, into a desert wasteland. The video follows the journey of Vladimir, a fisherman from Uzbekistan, as he travels along the Silk Road to show the viewer the beauty of his homeland.
