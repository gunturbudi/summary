# Summary of Google, Facebook, Amazon - The rise of the mega-corporations | DW Documentary

Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=Dy8ogOaKk4Y

The DW Documentary analyzes the rise of mega-corporations, such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon, and their influence on society. These companies have caused significant housing crises and income inequality in the Silicon Valley area. Tech giants also use tax avoidance to invest in rural areas, which raises questions about their influence on the government. Furthermore, these corporations are growing through the acquisition of hundreds of competitors, which enables them to collect oceans of data, rendering them as private property, and resulting in antitrust complaints. There are concerns about data sharing, monopolistic power, and control over access. These companies are also able to influence people's beliefs, feelings, and knowledge, which is why democratic governments must use technology to advance their democratic agendas rather than allowing tech companies to advance their corporate interests. There is a need to transform the system itself to limit the influence of publicly elected politicians. Finally, advocates propose banning the sale of users' data, as it can amplify misleading and harmful content for profit.

In this section, the DW Documentary delves into the consequences of the rise of tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Amazon in Silicon Valley, where the success of these companies has led to a housing crisis and income inequality. The documentary highlights the bleakest side of this once-picturesque neighborhood, where thousands are homeless and some have even been forced to live out of their vehicles. The convenience provided by these huge firms overshadows the unavoidable side-effects of their dominance of the marketplace, leaving some to question how these companies have become too big to regulate or stop. The documentary touches on the taxation issue and how the super-rich are avoiding paying their fair share of taxes, leaving the burden on the working class or the social safety nets.

In this section, the video discusses how tech companies such as Facebook are using tax avoidance to invest in rural areas, such as Prineville, Oregon, to build data centers. While these companies provide jobs and infrastructure, they also cost these towns millions of dollars in lost taxes. Prineville's politicians are susceptible to Facebook's influence, as the company makes donations to the town for projects that the economy cannot afford to do. This raises questions about whether this deal with Facebook is fair and whether tech giants have more power and influence than the government. The video also discusses how BlackRock, a financial services firm, became a huge corporation by managing assets worth nine trillion US dollars and becoming a predator in buying up other people's assets.

In this section, the rise of mega-corporations like Amazon is examined, with a focus on how access to cheap capital has become a key strategy for these companies. Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, focused on spending revenue and access to easily-gotten capital on the optimization of supply chain, ensuring products arrived at their customer's doorstep faster than anyone else in the world. Amazon is now one of the most valuable companies in the world along with Google, Facebook, and Apple, with a net worth of approximately $7 trillion as of September 2021. However, the company has also faced criticism for dictating prices to retailers and establishing a near-monopoly in the online retail space that has resulted in the deprioritization of smaller businesses.

In this section, the documentary discusses how mega corporations like Apple, Google, and Facebook have grown through the acquisition of hundreds of competitors, and how they use the data they extract from our personal lives for advertising and political campaigns. The rise of surveillance capitalism has become the dominant economic paradigm for these companies, as they collect oceans of data, rendering it as behavioral data and claiming it as their private property. This has led to concerns about their monopolistic power and control over access to their ecosystems, which has resulted in antitrust complaints and a panel of experts pushing to keep an eye on Facebook.

In this section, the documentary explores the increasing power of big tech corporations like Google, Facebook, and Amazon and their ability to influence how people feel, what they believe, and what they know through their control of information and data. The US government has pursued several cases against these tech giants, but so far, without much success. Many critics believe that democratic governments need to start using technology to advance their democratic agendas rather than letting tech companies use it to advance their corporate interests. The EU is expected to curb the power of tech giants with two new directives from 2020, the Digital Service Act (DSA), and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aim to ensure fairness in competition and data sharing while also maintaining transparency and fundamental rights. However, big tech companies are fighting back against these regulations through extensive lobbying efforts.

00:25:00
In this section, it is discussed how global mega-corporations like Apple use their power and resources to squash democratic accountability. The documentary describes how lobbying is used to put pressure on undesirable regulations, and the European Commission is proposing creating 80 positions to enforce the rules. However, Apple's legal department alone has 900 employees, making it impossible to compete with the funding and lawyers of these mega-corporations. It is said that the system is corrupted, and the system itself must be transformed in terms of who influences our publicly elected politicians. Relations between Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. are close, and United States corporations can essentially buy elections.

In this section, the DW Documentary explores the rise of mega-corporations like Alibaba, which has close ties to the Chinese government. The communist party has representatives working within the company, and there are concerns about the influence of politics on the company's operations. The Chinese state controls data and censors content on its platforms like TikTok, which has become more successful than its US competition thanks to its improved algorithm. However, there are growing fears in China about the power of its own tech companies, and the government has been tightening regulations to avoid a scenario in which big tech overruns the government, as is the case in the US and Europe. Meanwhile, in Nevada, companies are working on a project to create their own city independent of local laws.

00:35:00
In this section, we learn about Jeffrey Burns, the CEO of cryptocurrency firm Blockchains LLC, and his desire to create independent local governments called "innovation zones" for tech companies that invest at least $1.25 billion. Burns donated money to Nevada Governor Steve Sisilak and hired influential lobbyists to support his idea. The governor announced a bill proposing this in early 2021, but it faced heavy criticism and was eventually withdrawn in August 2021. Meanwhile, in Washington, antitrust proceedings against tech giants like Google and Facebook have been ongoing, but legal expert Chris Sagers is skeptical about their effectiveness in the long term. Cyber expert Maritia Shaka prefers action on a global scale to rebalance the power of tech companies and prioritize democracy over technology.

00:40:00
In this section of the documentary, advocates are calling for a ban on the business model of Facebook and other tech giants, which involves collecting and selling user data. Shoshana Zuboff argues that the amplification of divisive and harmful content for profit should be made illegal. Historian Rutger Bregman highlights the uncontrolled power of mega corporations and the growing wealth gap, pointing out that the 50s and 60s were a time when high taxes on the wealthy resulted in economic growth and innovation. The documentary suggests that the intersection of greed, new technology, and big politics has created an opaque world that future generations will need to strive to regulate.
