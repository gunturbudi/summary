The lithium ion battery has played an important role in many different industries, from smartphones to e-cars. However, lithium ion batteries rely on rare-earth metals and other natural resources, and the recycling of millions of batteries remains a challenge.

The battery industry is constantly trying to find more sustainable and efficient energy storage materials to replace those that are currently in use. One such material is cobalt, which enhances the overall function of batteries, but finding a good replacement isn't easy. Researchers are testing and retesting potential materials to find something that can withstand thousands of charging cycles and is sustainable.

One decade ago, only a few people realized that lithium ion technology could replace the standard lead-acid rechargeable batteries used in forklifts. The first lithium-ion powered mass market forklift was introduced in 2011, and it was made by Junheinrich in Hamburg, Germany. Despite being a major commercial success, the EJE 112i was still too expensive to be competitive. The lithium ion battery was revolutionary mainly because it offered a dramatic improvement in storage capacity and output voltage. However, the cost and sustainability of hydrogen as an energy storage material remains a major challenge. Producing hydrogen from electricity is energy intensive and converting the hydrogen in the fuel cell into electricity to operate a vehicle is also an energy-intensive process. In the end, a hydrogen cell is far less efficient than if I take the electricity thatâ€™s generated and store it in a lithium ion battery.

The lithium ion battery is still an important technology, and there is still potential for improvement. Scientists are researching ways to extract lithium from thermal water, which could revolutionize the sustainability of rechargeable batteries. If the principle works in practice, up to 160 milligrams of lithium carbonate could be extracted from a liter of thermal water.

The lithium-ion battery is a technology that has become incredibly important in recent years, powering everything from smartphones to e-cars. Thermal water rich in lithium is used to create the batteries, with high quality lithium carbonate being produced in the process. The industry is striving for sustainability, with plans to recycle spent batteries.

The lithium ion battery is a popular type of battery that is used in a variety of electronic devices, including smartphones and e-cars. The battery has a number of potential second lives, including being used to stabilize the grid, as a storage device, and for recycling. A massive energy storage facility is under construction using used lithium ion batteries from industrial applications.

The video discusses the importance of lithium ion batteries, and how they are being used in a variety of different ways to improve efficiency and sustainability. One of the challenges faced with lithium ion batteries is that they degrade over time, and research is being done to find ways to extend their lifespan. A Nobel Prize was awarded in chemistry in 2019 for work on lithium ion batteries.

00:30:00
The researchers at the University of Freiberg are developing ways to recycle lithium ion batteries, and they believe that mechanical recycling is the best option. They are somewhere halfway down the path of developing the technology, but they don't know everything yet.

The lithium ion battery is an important part of e-mobility, and its technology has already transformed the way we live and work. Intralogistics can benefit more quickly than other sectors from e-mobility solutions because warehouses are enclosed, and the battery is a key factor because energy is the decisive factor.
