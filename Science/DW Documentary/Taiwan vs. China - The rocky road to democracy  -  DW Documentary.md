Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Taiwan is a democratic country located in the southern Chinese province of Taiwan. The country has been at odds with the People's Republic of China (PRC) over sovereignty and the future of the island since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1949. In 2020, Taiwan held a presidential election which was closely watched by the PRC. The incumbent, Tsai Ing-wen, was re-elected with a record-breaking 8 million votes. This victory is a blow to Beijing, which views Taiwan as a province that must be returned to the fold. Jai Wei Lin is a Taiwanese who seeks to distance himself from his Chinese roots, but finds it difficult due to the omnipresence of China.

In 2014, tens of thousands of students gathered in front of the Taiwanese Parliament to protest the ratification of a trade agreement with China which they feared would shift control of Taiwan's economy to Beijing. The Sunflower Movement, as the uprising was called, lasted 23 days and jolted awake and new political consciousness in the Taiwanese state. If this occupation of Parliament had indeed been a crime, Jaylin Wang would have gone to jail for it.

Taiwan has made great strides in democracy over the past few decades, but there is still some work to be done in terms of uniting the youth with the parents who support democracy. This divide is a major obstacle to the country's continued progress, and it is something that needs to be addressed in order to ensure that Taiwan remains a free and democratic land.

Taiwan has experienced great economic success under a dictatorial government, but this has come at the cost of worker rights and freedoms. Jay Wei Lin, a 36-year-old son of a conservative pro-Chinese family, struggles to reconcile his beliefs with the reality of a democratic Taiwan. His father still insists that they steer clear of politics, but the increasing pressure from China has led to a reluctance to engage with officials and a lack of transparency in government. The cost of this democracy process is high, and the people of Taiwan are starting to push back.

Taiwan has been struggling to establish democracy since it was expelled from the UN in 1971. The conflict with China has simmered at a show of force, but the threat of war between the two sides has divided the population. Sam Yang, a musician, wields his music as a political weapon, and his band, Fire x, sings in Taiwanese, the language that was suppressed by Chiang Kai-shek and replaced with Mandarin.

Taiwan's rocky road to democracy is illustrated by the story of pop star Chao Tsuyu, who was punished for speaking Taiwanese on a South Korean reality show. While many young people are proud of their Taiwanese heritage, it can come with some unpleasant consequences, such as the loss of advertising contracts from a Chinese manufacturer. The video also discusses the need for social discourse between the political left and right in Taiwan, and how China is behaving like a wild lion while the lion should be caged so that the peaceful animals of the world can come together.
