In early 2019, more than 40,000 people from the last remaining territory under the control of the Islamic State surrendered to the Syrian government. Leonora Messing, one of these individuals, found herself in a Syrian prison camp soon after surrendering. While in the camp, she became a mother for a second time and the little one's name was Maria but Maria's health was frail and she'd been hospitalized several times. Germany was debating whether to repatriate people who had joined the Islamic State, but were they still dangerous. In March 2019, Leonora traveled to Syria herself and met with other former Islamic State members. She told them she had stopped believing in the Islamic State a long time ago, but what she thought about her own actions and what she had learned during her time in the group remain unclear.
