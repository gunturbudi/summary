The New Silk Road is a vast undertaking started by China to revive and expand trade routes between China and 65 different countries.

This video documents the economic and social changes in a Chinese-majority city in Cambodia, See Anouk, as it transitions from a sleepy, rural town to a bustling, cityscape. Crime and tensions between the Chinese and Cambodians are on the rise, and the Chinese are taking advantage of the situation by exploiting the locals. The Chinese are not adapting to the culture or the language of the Cambodians, and the old, cosmopolitan Kashgar is gradually disappearing as the dominant culture in the city.

This YouTube video introduces the New Silk Road, a project that aims to connect China to Pakistan. The airport built as part of the project is empty, and there are no passenger services currently in operation. The video also follows a truck carrying goods from Pakistan to China, which is risky due to the dangerous conditions on the Karakoram Highway.

The New Silk Road is a long, dangerous drive through beautiful but dangerous terrain in China and Pakistan. The road is not clear what purpose it will serve, and it is a very tenuous strand on the Silk Road. The Karakoram mountains also seem to prefer their isolation, and a massive landslide killed 20 people in the village of Audubon in 2010, blocking the road. The highway was rerouted through the mountains before setting out to cross the Alps with a team of elephants. After 600 kilometers, we reach the construction site where another stretch of road is being carved into the mountains. The drills carving out space for the next blast are extremely loud, and the workers wear ear protection, but the danger of falling rocks is ever-present. Hard time sleeping especially when something unexpected has happened? Then I can't sleep the same holds for everyone here at the construction site. In our bosses in Beijing, 7,000 Pakistanis work here and 1,200 Chinese, but their families are thousands of kilometers away and the internet connection is unreliable.
