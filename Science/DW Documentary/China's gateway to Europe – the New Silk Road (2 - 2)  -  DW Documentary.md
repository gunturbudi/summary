China's Belt and Road Initiative aims to connect Europe through its New Silk Road. China has invested in southeastern and eastern European nations in the hope of creating a single rail corridor to transport goods across Europe. However, some in the region are torn between China's opportunities and their loyalty to Europe. The lack of transparency in Chinese investment in Serbia's infrastructure and the installation of thousands of cameras with the latest surveillance technology in the country have made Serbia's relationship with China controversial. There is also competition from countries that profit from Chinese goods, and there are environmental concerns around the construction of the railway line. Despite criticism from the EU, Hungary has pivoted towards China, seeking external financial and technological assistance to develop the region. The only current project for China and Hungary on the New Silk Road is the Belgrade-Budapest railway line, which is set for completion in 2025 and would be the first Chinese-built railway line to reach the European Union.

In this section, the focus is on China's New Silk Road and its intention to reach Europe through its 'Belt and Road' initiative. The first and third sections of the project have been constructed by China Railway, and China is aiming to transport goods across Europe through a single rail corridor by investing in southeastern and eastern European nations. Despite bringing cutting-edge technology, China is prepared to invest in older, environmentally harmful processes. Although Southeastern Europe has the promise of new investment, the region is torn between China's opportunities and its loyalty to Europe. China has granted ten billion euros worth of loans to Serbia, more than any other country in the region, but even the construction largely relies on a Chinese workforce.

In this section, it is discussed how the Chinese state investment in Serbia has primarily been through infrastructure and construction projects, most notably the rapid construction of railways. The loans from Chinese state banks are considered quick and cheap; however, some are critical of the Chinese government's involvement in Serbia's infrastructural investments as no public tenders have been held for some of the projects. One critic believes corruption is involved, and transparency is limited. Nevertheless, Serbian officials remain content to "close ranks with China," as there is a chance for a photo-op and money flowing into construction.

In this section, we see that the installation of thousands of cameras with the latest surveillance technology has made Serbia's relationship with China controversial. Nevena Ružić and her team express their skepticism over the installation of these cameras without any transparency and a public debate on the need for surveillance. The lack of acceptance of privacy as a human right in China and data privacy laws being questionable can affect Serbia's attempts to join the EU. Also, journalist Milomir Marić reveals that the EU's slow accession process and Serbia's inability to fulfil demands have led the government to seek partners like China. China's economic growth message prioritizes its investment and loans, which have helped connect Serbia to northern ports importing Chinese goods.

In this section, it is highlighted that there is worry and competition from countries that profit from Chinese goods and are concerned about the completion of the southern route, which will allow goods to be imported through Greece, Serbia, or Italy via the port of Piraeus. Serbia’s government has a ‘friendship of steel’ with China, which has expanded even amidst the pandemic, but the European Union remains Serbia’s biggest financial supporter. Although the Chinese aid arrived during the pandemic, with Beijing emphasizing its strengths to combat the virus, the EU had paid for the transportation of the aid to Serbia, which was only mentioned in passing due to public and EU pressures. The construction of the railway line will impact the area’s wetlands, which are vital for Danube’s water drainage and cause problems if destroyed. The Serbian town of Sremski Karlovci will be disconnected from the river by the track, and people will have to take an underpass to reach the Danube, and locals' concerns have been overlooked in planning and democratic participation.

In this section, the poor air quality and heavy pollution in Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina, is highlighted, including the fact that it is causing the early deaths of many of its residents, with cancer being a particularly common cause due to the high levels of sulfur dioxide and particulate matter. Sixty percent of all energy consumed in Bosnia, a candidate for EU membership, is still generated by coal, contributing significantly to the pollution. In addition, the construction of a new coal-fired power plant is taking place, with China's Exim Bank providing over 600 million euros in loans, which many fear will only exacerbate the issue.

00:25:00
In this section, the environmental impact of the Tuzla power plant in Bosnia and Herzegovina and its expansion by the Chinese is discussed. The plant's toxic waste is disposed of in the surrounding area, allowing it to seep into the groundwater. There are concerns about the pollution harming the health of both people and nature. The Bosnian government is blamed for signing the deal with China as there were no environmental standards regarding disposing the waste. Activists, local politicians, and residents want the government to find a different disposal site far away from Tuzla.

00:30:00
In this section, the focus is on Bosnia and Hungary's relationship with China and the New Silk Road initiative. Bosnia is facing a shift from old power plants to a modern coal-fired power plant that will help protect the environment and bring investment from China; however, some residents like Goran Stojak are hoping for changes in the government that will phase out coal power more quickly. Hungary has long-standing ties to China and the Chinese population there keeps largely to itself, with many small businessmen coming to Hungary under the agreement that visas are not required. The New Silk Road initiative has further grown their numbers and is seen as an opportunity for business with easy access to the rest of Europe.

00:35:00
In this section, the video explores Hungary's close ties with China despite criticism from the EU. Hungary has pivoted towards China, seeking external financial and technological help to develop the region. Despite the Hungarian government's public wooing of Chinese partners, some politicians like Bernadett Szél worry about the country's increasing pivot towards an autocratic China. The EU commission has criticized the rail project linking Belgrade and Budapest for initially lacking public tender and for being funded by Chinese loans. Critics also argue that the railway is not a priority for Hungary and that the country should invest in its own railway system instead.

00:40:00
In this section, we see that the only current project for China and Hungary on the New Silk Road is the Belgrade-Budapest railway line. While most of the governments in the region believed that China would invest and build the infrastructure they needed, this has not happened, leading to disappointment in China. Despite this, Hungary still hopes to get as much assistance from China as possible. However, experts advise being realistic about China's future role in Hungary's economy as they may not play a significant role. The Belgrade-Budapest route is set for completion in 2025 and would be the first Chinese-built railway line to reach the European Union.
