The second section of the documentary examines the continuing significance of the Bauhaus movement in contemporary times. It explores the relationship between art, craft, and industry and the ideal of universality of design, which still inspires designers today. The documentary features the influence of the Bauhaus design on product design, particularly through the Braun design language and the creation of everyday objects by Dieter Rams. Despite some criticisms of the Bauhaus brand as too commercial, the documentary emphasizes that the movement's legacy still raises crucial questions regarding life in the future and the role of design in improving everyday life.

In this section, the documentary explores the continued relevance of Bauhaus in modern times. The ideals of the school, like a universal language of design and collaboration between art, craft, and industry, remain influential today. The documentary compares Bauhaus with IKEA, a company that has embraced the Bauhaus vision of affordable, well-made products for the masses through its "democratic design" ethos. Bauhaus had a tumultuous history, being shut down when Hitler rose to power, but its artists and architects spread its influence around the world and continue to inspire designers today.

In this section, the documentary discusses the close ties between the Bauhaus school and industry, with the school designing fittings for homes and brochures for companies. However, this also led to criticism and eventually a change in leadership. Under Swiss architect Hannes Meyer, the Bauhaus became even more focused on industry and took a socialist turn. The goal was to design and manufacture well-made products for everyone, prioritizing everyday needs over artistic considerations. This philosophy has been adapted by companies like IKEA, which aims to create a better everyday life for the many through mass-produced products. Although the Bauhaus was rejected in early communist East Germany as a bourgeois institution, it was later reevaluated and seen as a good thing, with the legacy of Hannes Meyer being politicized design and the famous slogan "form follows function." Today, Bauhaus designed products are expensive and only accessible to the well-off.

In this section, we learn about the spread of Bauhaus design beyond the school itself. The Vagan Feld lamp, a luxury item produced by Bauhaus, made its way to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the museum's founding director, Alfred Barr, helped introduce Americans to the Bauhaus movement. Barr was drawn to the school's push to incorporate art into everyday life, merge art and technology, and make art non-hierarchical. The Bauhaus became a brand due to its success, with some claiming the Bauhaus name became a catch-all label devoid of real substance. Nonetheless, connoisseurs of design and architecture still admire the Bauhaus style, as evidenced by the couple who found a house designed by Bauhaus architect Marcel Breuer while searching for a bungalow in need of renovation.

In this section, the video explores the way in which Bauhaus's principles of design were adopted by homeowners, particularly in terms of furniture and architecture. The emphasis on functionality and problem-solving led to innovative designs that were still aesthetically pleasing. The video also highlights the importance of design in shaping society and solving bigger issues, which was a foundational belief of the Bauhaus movement. The section showcases iconic examples of international product design, including some of the famous pieces by Marcel Breuer and Mies van der Rohe. The video also shows how modernist architecture can be both austere and flamboyant, as demonstrated by Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona chair and pavilion.

00:20:00
In this section, the documentary focuses on the architects who were influenced by the Bauhaus movement and continued to create innovative and socially responsible buildings after the school's closure. The Seagram building by Mies van der Rohe is highlighted as a prime example of a sleek, minimalist skyscraper with no decorative fa√ßade. The documentary also features interviews with residents of the Bauhaus-designed affordable housing project called the Laubengang Houses, who appreciate the communal walkway and the affordable yet innovative design by architect Hannes Meyer. These buildings reflect the Bauhaus principles of creating functional, affordable, and aesthetically pleasing structures that serve a social purpose.

00:25:00
In this section, the documentary explores the practicality of living in a Bauhaus building in the early 21st century, despite the limitations in space. The efficiency and innovative design solutions of Bauhaus architecture are highlighted, along with the influence it had on the art and design world, particularly in the United States, where it became the foundation for generations of artists and the backbone of American modernism. The legacy of Bauhaus is undeniable, with its principles still shaping much of what we see and experience today.

00:30:00
In this section, the impact of Bauhaus on the arts in the 1950s is examined. Schools that had taken inspiration from Bauhaus in America played a defining role in post-war American art through luminaries such as Jasper Jones, Robert Rauschenberg, and Merce Cunningham. Cunningham's dance works, in particular, mirrors the Bauhaus stage workshop experiments of exploring the human body as a mechanical object. The tradition of the Bauhaus movement continued in post-war West Germany at the ULM School of Design, where the Ulm model influenced the role of the designer, and industry partnerships helped raise funds for the school.

00:35:00
In this section, the documentary highlights the impact of the Bauhaus philosophy on the design of household appliances by the German brand Braun. Industrial designer Dieter Rams, a former Braun employee, applied the Bauhaus principle of simplicity and functionality to everyday objects, creating an iconic design language that influenced Apple's product design. The documentary discusses how today's highly individualized society values the expression of identity through the design of the products we buy, but emphasizes the importance of not losing sight of the human factor in design.

00:40:00
In this section, the excerpt discusses how the unity of art and technology has been replaced by the unity of art and commerce, turning Bauhaus into a brand and lifestyle. The narrator questions whether this mode of design has brought us to the brink of extinction with the destruction of our planet. However, the video posits that the reason Bauhaus still remains relevant today is that it raises fundamental questions about how we want to live in the future and the role good design can play in improving everyday life. The video concludes by teasing the third and final part of the series, which will explore the utopian world of Bauhaus.
