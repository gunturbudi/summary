The use of modern technology in archaeology is revolutionizing traditional methods. The documentary showcases various techniques, including geomagnetic surveys, GPS data, 3D scanning, virtual reality technology, Lidar scanning, and aerial photography to uncover buried structures, digitize cultural artifacts, and create highly accurate copies of ancient sites. These advanced methods allow archaeologists to obtain more information with less excavation and upload 3D images of found objects to the internet, providing access to knowledge for everyone. However, as these new methods become more prevalent, archaeologists must still practice caution to avoid destroying valuable clues for future research, and ethical questions arise around whether certain artifacts should be returned to their original sites or displayed in foreign museums.

Detail Summary:

In this section, archaeologists are shown using high-tech equipment, such as a geomagnetic apparatus that can survey a wide area to determine what lies beneath the surface without the need for a shovel. They cover two to three Hector's a day and the 16-sensor device is even more effective in gathering archaeological evidence. The archaeologists are scouting for traces of ancient life underground, with a non-invasive technique called prospection. They are able to take geomagnetic measurements of the ground and map out the terrain using a computer, giving them a better understanding of where they need to prospect. Their use of technology is revolutionizing traditional archaeology methods.

In this section, the DW History Documentary explores the use of modern technology in archaeology, including GPS data and sensors that measure the Earth's magnetic field to reveal buried structures. The documentary also showcases virtual reality technology used to create highly accurate copies of ancient sites, such as the Temple of the Weather God in Aleppo, Syria, which was destroyed during the civil war. Archaeologists are partnering with game developers to create these virtual reconstructions, allowing for a better understanding of ancient sites that may no longer be accessible to researchers.

In this section of the video, modern technology and 3D scanning are used to preserve cultural artifacts that have been damaged or lost to time, such as the digitally-preserved inscriptions on the damaged temple and the virtual model of the 14th-century Bremen COG ship. 3D scanning allows archaeologists to make exact copies of artifacts without having to search for the source of deformation or erosion, as they can clearly see every impact on the structure. The technology also allows researchers to view the shipwreck off the German island of Rugen in a new light, as the hundreds of overlapping photos create a 3D model that captures the details of the ship floor and ballast stones that would otherwise never be seen by the naked eye.

In this section, various techniques used in modern archeology are explored. Digitally recreating original lighting conditions of ancient artifacts such as the dome of the Alhambra allows for visitors to experience them as they were in their original context. Drones are commonly used to gather data and build digital models of landscapes, while geophysical survey methods based on measuring differences in the Earth's magnetic field, originally developed to locate submarines, is now used in archeology to discover hidden relics without digging. The work of archeologist Axel Paz Lucien E focuses on the mountain plateau of Globert near Frankfurt, revealing insights into the power and splendor of the ancient Celtic princes.

In this section, the documentary explores the role of aerial photography and lidar scanning in uncovering archaeological remains. The discovery of the grave of a Celtic Prince in Germany highlights the use of aerial photography in detecting dark structures in fields. Lidar scanning, on the other hand, is used to create 3D images of terrain, removing the noise of trees and vegetation to reveal structures beneath the ground. Through these methods, archaeologists have been able to discover buried structures such as the Roman Limes and field of burial mounds in forests. These non-destructive testing methods have revolutionized archaeology, making "the invisible visible."

In this section of the video, archaeologists are exploring the Hill of Tara in Ireland using modern technology such as magnetometers and digital scanning to search for buried archaeological sites. They find numerous circles below the surface potentially indicating grave mounds or sites of assembly. The prehistoric people who inhabited the area created sacred landscapes that were recorded in the ground and crafted with visual effects such as gaps along bank ramparts that allow for views of significant monuments. The Hill of Ward is another site that is explored, and although magnetic surveys are not useful due to heavy burning, geo-electric surveys reveal images of structures underground potentially indicating ritual spaces where large bonfires were ignited.

In this section, we see archaeologists explore various ancient sites using modern technology. From Ireland to Spain, this documentary highlights how advanced techniques like digital data processing, geomagnetic surveys, and high-performance scanning have revealed new insights into these centuries-old structures. Researchers have uncovered the use of visuals and astronomical alignment for construction and developed units of time without a calendar or a watch. However, the documentary also poses an ethical question of whether certain artifacts should be returned to their original sites or displayed in foreign museums.

In this section, the documentary highlights modern technology being used for archaeology, including photogrammetry and geomagnetic data. The team uses digital reconstruction to reveal the long-lost splendor of the Alhambra in a virtual reality experience. Using soil samples, the archaeologists can tell a lot about the living conditions of the people who lived there without excavating, and they can establish how old some of the charcoal is through radiocarbon dating. These new methods of investigation allow archaeologists to obtain more information with less excavation, and uploading 3D images of found objects to the internet allows everyone access to the knowledge.

In this section, archeologists are shown using high-tech equipment to explore the past. By pulsing soil with x-rays, they are able to detect specific elements, such as phosphorus, to help determine the length of time a settlement was used for. However, even with these advanced methods, archeologists must be cautious not to excavate too much and destroy valuable clues for future research. While digital archaeology is becoming more prevalent, it is still important for archaeologists to do fieldwork and gain a holistic sense of a location.
