Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
In this section, it is revealed that Cuba has been suffering from economic ruins since 1990, with Cubans unable to afford basic necessities with their income. Despite the government putting into place a plan to fix the country's economy, including increasing salaries and pensions, it has not worked in practice. There is still two, or even three, currencies in circulation, with inflation continually rising. As a result, the Cuban population has become significantly poorer with real wages falling, meaning purchasing power has gone down considerably. Despite this, the country has always suffered from crises, and its people continue to hope that one day things will improve.

In this section, drivers in Cuba speak about the challenge of keeping their cars running by being resourceful and using parts from different makes and models. They also express their struggles with shortages of basic necessities such as food and milk, which are essential but hard to come by. While there may be temporary surges in the availability of some items, the shortage of goods continues to be a persistent issue in Cuba.

In this section, we hear from Cuban citizens facing severe shortages and high prices for basic goods. Despite media insistence that things are improving, many people can no longer afford fruits and vegetables, and must turn to the black market for necessities like chicken and soap. Some problems stem from logistics, but many are caused by lack of resources and socialist economic policies. Despite the hardships, people are afraid to speak out against the government, and have become accustomed to a culture of unofficial trade to survive.

In this section, the video highlights how the US embargo, the pandemic, and Cuba's own inefficiencies have created a "perfect storm" leading to high prices, long lines, and shortages in the country. The Trump administration's actions against Cuba, which included labeling them as a state sponsor of terrorism and enacting over 200 pieces of legislation, led to many banks freezing Cuban accounts abroad, further exacerbating the economic struggles. The pandemic also affected international trade, which is crucial to Cuba's economy due to remittances, tourism, and professionals working overseas. However, the video notes that Cuba's own socialist model has also failed in producing enough food and resources for its people. Despite these challenges, Cubans maintain their spirit and solidarity with one another as they navigate their daily lives.

In this section, a Cuban artist laments the state of her country's architecture and infrastructure, stating that much of Havana is slowly falling into ruin due to neglect, poor maintenance, and outright destruction. She recalls how the city was clean and beautifully maintained before Fidel Castro's revolution and that the present conditions make her cry every day, with sewage running down the streets, and once-beautiful buildings reduced to rubble. The artist and her peers talk about the once-rich history of their families, how their grandparents were wealthy but the revolution took everything from them, including their ownership of livestock, and how various interventions by the state shaped Cuba's present state. Despite the hardships, one of the artists maintains that they hold an emotional and spiritual attachment to the revolution.

In this section, the video highlights the current economic situation in Cuba, where prices are extremely high and salaries don't match. Since the end of socialism, Cubans have struggled to afford basic necessities and often require a second income. Poverty and inequality have increased over the years, and the recent developments have exacerbated the situation. The economy should have been restructured earlier, but some people in the government opposed the reform, fearing a collapse similar to that of the Soviet Union. As a result, many Cubans are struggling to afford essential items like shoes and phones, and access to these items often requires having relatives in the US or a second income.

In this section, the documentary discusses the issues of high prices, lines, and shortages in Cuba. The Soviet-made cars in the country are becoming increasingly expensive despite their reliability. Meanwhile, the socialist system in Cuba has not held up well since its fall, with younger generations not believing in the promises of change. The Cuban system of bureaucratic socialism and single-party rule relies on a monopoly of information that no longer exists due to the internet and social media. The country is facing a lot of contradictions, with some trusting the official media and others being more skeptical. Finally, Padura's main character, Mario Conde, in his books is portrayed as being quite tired of life and politics in Cuba.

In this section, we hear from Leonardo, a Cuban author and activist, who shares his experiences protesting for freedom of expression in Cuba, where he held a sign advocating for socialism but against repression. Leonardo was arrested for creating a public disturbance and spreading enemy propaganda. His sign confused both government supporters and protesters. Leonardo was interrogated more than 25 times, and his friends and family were put under pressure after his protests, highlighting the limited freedom of expression in Cuba.

00:40:00
In this section, Cuban citizens reveal the pressure they face to inform on dissidents in their communities, and the government's attempts to scare and intimidate them. Protests are allowed in Cuba, as long as they are approved by authorities, and are often organized by schools and permit harmless causes such as the mourning of medical students executed 150 years ago. However, citizens call for a future with mutual understanding and much more dialogue, expressing concerns over the lack of freedom and worsening shortages of food, and emphasizing the need for change before it is too late.

In this section, we see the effects of the economic situation in Cuba, where people can't afford to live and must wait in long lines because of shortages, causing some individuals to resort to marrying foreigners in order to access their money. The rock band they interview talk about their love for music and how it provides a way to express themselves freely despite the political situation. The documentary also touches on the difficulty of restructuring in Cuba and the negative effects of corruption, including the rise of the black market, and how the government must find new solutions to improve the situation.

00:50:00
In this section, a Cuban citizen discusses the economic struggles in Cuba and the lack of acknowledgment by its leaders. Despite the empty slogans of patriotism and victory, the reality is that the country is in economic ruins, causing shortages and high prices. The citizen emphasizes the need for grassroots organization rather than relying on the government or leaders to solve the problems.
