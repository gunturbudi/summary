This video presents the issue of water ownership in the United States, and how it has become a central issue in agricultural and water-related disputes. The documentary focuses on the Imperial Irrigation District (IID), which has the senior water rights to the Colorado River. The IID uses this water to irrigate crops in the middle of the desert, and much of this food is then exported to China. The agricultural industry is aware of the water scarcity problem, but is less willing to pay for water than it was in the past. This has led to investment in water by businessmen like John Vidovich, who are unpopular with long-established farmers.

Henry Miller, an ancestor of the narrator, is the largest landowner in the United States and fought for the rights of Californians to access water. In the late 1800s, he realized that water would be key to the success of his butcher-business, and so he took his water rights all the way to federal court - and won. Water is still accessible to people living in the US based on the decisions and foresight of Henry Miller. However, the water shortage is affecting farmers in different ways, with some facing herd reductions of up to 30%. Psychological pressure is also affecting them.
