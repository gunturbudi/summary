In the end, Hahn was ordered by German banking authorities to pay a fine for his actions. Additionally, the section explores the fine line between market manipulation and normal market practices, and how private investors are seen to be doing it to enrich themselves.

In this section, the video explores the luxurious lifestyle that Florian Homm lived, from his gated communities to jets, yachts, and private zoos.

For instance, he sometimes liked inviting people to his Majorca estate and asking strange questions, such as whether they brought their swimming trunks. The documentary suggests that the heart of the case against him was his role in inflating the value of hedge funds and profiting from the artificial increase in stock prices.

Homm claimed to have felt drained and exhausted by the summer of 2007, and left Majorca with a stash of cash before throwing his mobile phone into the harbor and flying off to freedom. While he claims to have done many things he admired, leaving behind a sense of unease and question marks over his actions.
