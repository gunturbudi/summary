The DW Documentary "Africa's Looted Art" discusses how colonial looting has impacted African societies, their cultural heritage, and the difficulty in repatriating looted artifacts. The video highlights two examples of looted African art, the Tangué and the Benin Bronzes, and the consequences of colonialism. The lack of physical objects from their ancestors makes it harder for young people to connect with their history and cultural heritage. The issue of succession and power struggles over the objects, the ethics of displaying sacred objects obtained unethically, and the debate of whether repatriation is a priority are also raised. The video emphasizes returning African artifacts to their rightful places as a means of reconciliation for the atrocities committed in the past and towards healing and reinventing the future.

In this section, the YouTube video discusses the impact of colonial looting on the cultural heritage of African societies. The looting of artifacts not only hollowed out African societies but also had a ripple effect that suppressed their souls and forced them into slavery. The video highlights the pressing issue of repatriating African art looted by colonial powers in the past, such as the ornate figurehead known as Tangué that was taken by German colonial powers in the 19th century. While European museums continue to hold onto these works of art, African societies demand that they be returned to their rightful owners.

In this section, the documentary describes two examples of looted African art and the consequences of colonialism. The first is the story of a wood carving called Tangué taken from Lock Priso's house in Cameroon in the late 19th century by German consul Max Buchner, which is now housed in today's Five Continents Museum. Professor Prince Kum'a Ndumbe the Third has been demanding its return, but he must prove he is the rightful heir. The second story focuses on Benin City, in southern Nigeria, and on the centuries-old bronze works that are a source of pride for the Benin people. The British launched a punitive expedition in 1897 after the king, the Oba, refused to allow British influence into the last independent kingdom in the region. The British troops burned down towns and villages, massacring local residents, and looted many of the bronze works, which can still be found today in European museums.

In this section, the video focuses on the looting of artifacts from Africa and the difficulty in repatriating them. Many valuable artifacts were stolen, shipped to Europe, and distributed among its major museums such as Berlin. The Benin National Museum showcases the history of the famous Benin Bronzes, but the older works are still in Europe and the US. The objects taken abroad helped to tell African stories which changed negative narratives about them. Meanwhile, Germany’s ethnological museums are brimming with artifacts amassed overseas, but only 5% of them have ever been displayed. The Linden Museum Stuttgart is looking into provenance research of its Namibia Collection with the help of Steven Isaack from the initiative Heritage Watch Namibia.

with the return of some stolen artifacts, the damage inflicted by colonialism on Africa continues to be felt today, as evidenced by the struggles of many former colonies to gain economic independence and resolve lingering conflicts over arbitrarily drawn borders. Artists in Benin City are exploring the trauma of colonial rule in their creative work, but the lack of physical objects from their ancestors makes it harder for young people to connect with their history and cultural heritage. Despite the challenges, there is hope that the return of looted art and a greater recognition of Africa's contributions to world culture will help to overcome the legacy of colonialism.

In this section, the video explores the issue of repatriation and restoration of African artifacts. An estimated 95 percent of artifacts from Benin currently housed in overseas museums were looted during the punitive expedition, but the repatriation process has been stalled for more than a century. The Benin Dialogue Group, which was founded to consider the issue, has been criticized for lack of transparency and discussing only permanent loans. However, some African stakeholders, such as the Bele Bele family of Cameroon, have also disagreed over the issue of repatriation due to their own power struggles. Ultimately, repatriation is a logistical challenge that requires political decisions, but public museums in Europe are generally not in a position to make autonomous decisions about repatriation.

In this section, the issue of succession is raised in relation to an artifact in Douala, and the controversy around Paul Mbappe's claim. Meanwhile, some individuals in Nigeria's thriving contemporary art scene question whether the country is ready to receive the Benin bronzes, which were looted from Benin City by the British in the 19th century. Nike Okundaye suggests building a modern museum to house the pieces, but concerns remain about security and the possibility that they could be sold or stolen again. The lack of funding for Nigeria's arts and culture institutions remains an obstacle to their return to the country. Meanwhile, the ethics of displaying sacred objects obtained unethically, such as the Tangué, are called into question, with some describing museums as "prisons" and others seeing them as objects that bring people together.

In this section, the co-founder of the Contemporary Art Center Doual'art, Marilyn Douala Bell, argues that art should not be confined to museums but should belong among the people, in marketplaces and villages. She suggests copies of the objects should be made and displayed in communal spaces to awaken a new historical narrative. Meanwhile, in Namibia, the German delegation returns Hendrik Witbooi's bible and whip to its rightful place after more than 100 years. Although the return is symbolic, these artefacts are a reminder of Germany's colonial past and the atrocities it committed. It raises the question of what responsibility Europe has to Africa and whether the return of looted art is enough to rectify the consequences of colonial thinking that still shapes politics today.

In this section, the debate is raised whether the return of Africa's looted art is a priority when there are urgent problems such as poverty and food that need to be addressed. However, an artist argues that education on cultural heritage is also vital, and physically seeing the artwork is more educative than viewing pictures. Victor Ehikhamenor visits Europe and the US specifically to see the Benin Bronzes, otherwise known as his "ancestors," but suggests it's time for them to go back home - as the younger generations need to develop their emotional connection to the objects. The debate raises the issue that some cases may not have straightforward solutions, and perhaps in some situations, there will be a lack of resolution. Nonetheless, museums must face up to their responsibility, come to clarity on their collections, and find ways to reconcile their past actions.

In this section, the importance of returning African artifacts to their rightful places is emphasized as a means of reconciliation for the atrocities committed in the past. The video argues that it is not enough for African heritage to simply be displayed in museums abroad, but rather that these objects should be physically returned to their places of origin. The Igue Festival in Benin City is highlighted as an example of how history can live and breathe, and the wounds of the past have yet to completely heal. The video suggests returning the art and apologizing as a necessary step towards healing and reinventing the future.
