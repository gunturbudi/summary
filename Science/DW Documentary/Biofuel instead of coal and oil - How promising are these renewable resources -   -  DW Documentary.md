The DW documentary "Biofuel instead of coal and oil - How promising are these renewable resources?" explores the potential of the bioeconomy in replacing fossil fuels with renewable resources. Researchers are using biotechnology to transform the industry by increasing available biomass and focusing on increased production of biomass while warning against species loss, depleted soils, water shortages, and land conversion. The video explores plant milking, using fly larvae as a replacement for soy and fish meal in livestock farming, enzymatic reactions to create energy-efficient and environmentally friendly products, challenges with wood as a raw material, potential of biofuels and plant-based nutrition to protect the environment, food production from thin air, and the challenges of implementing a bioeconomy. Ultimately, the success of the bioeconomy will depend on consumer support and decreasing resource consumption, recycling and reusing more, and making do with less.

Detail Summary:

In this section, researchers discuss the potential of the bioeconomy and how it may help the world shift from fossil fuels to renewable resources. The bioeconomy involves using plants, fungi, insects, and bacteria instead of coal and oil to produce chemicals and bio-products. The Hamper surface mine in Germany will be transformed into a bioeconomy area where raw materials will be grown in the fields instead of being extracted from the earth. The bioeconomy is not new, but researchers are now using biotechnology to transform the industry by increasing available biomass. Researchers are also working on increasing yields of local crops such as sugar beet.

In this section, scientists use radioactive carbon and a scanner to investigate the root system of sugar beets to understand how they can be cultivated to produce more biomass for renewable resources. However, cultivating large amounts of biomass for a petroleum-free economy using technology has led to species loss, depleted soils, and water shortages, causing yields to decline again. Ecologists warn of the dangers of land conversion in other countries, burning down rainforests, and primeval forests to make agricultural lands. The goal should be more economical consumption instead of focusing on increased production of biomass.

In this section, we explore the concept of plant milking, which involves soilless cultivation through which roots hang in the air and are regularly sprayed with a nutrient solution from below to produce certain molecules. This development is unlike conventional agriculture and has the advantage of reducing the area required by at least 300 times. Despite the high cost of the process, it is being used effectively for molecules in expensive products destined for such industries as pharma, cosmetics, food production, and crop protection.

In this section, the DW documentary explores the use of fly larvae as a replacement for soy and fish meal in livestock farming, which currently accounts for over 90% of the imported soy and fish meal in the European Union. By feeding animals with larvae of the soldier fly, which can be bred using biomass residues, such as wheat bran and feces, the farming industry can reduce their reliance on soy and fish meal, which contributes to the overfishing of oceans and deforestation of rainforests. The larvae can provide protein to the animals and are extremely resilient, making them easy to breed in a stable manner without any diseases interfering. Although the maggots do not grow equally well with all residual materials, studies have already shown that fodder made from insects can make animal breeding more environmentally friendly and is both cheaper and uses less energy than fish meal production.

In this section, we learn about the potential of using enzymatic reactions to create energy-efficient and environmentally friendly products such as bioplastics and biofuels. One project seeks to produce biofuels from straw using enzymes, making this process more efficient, but it remains economically uncompetitive compared to non-renewable options. Another project uses biotechnology to turn waste from sugar beet production into bioplastics, replacing petroleum products with a renewable resource. This solution, however, comes with its own environmental challenges as sugar beet farming uses pesticides and fertilizers that have a negative impact on the bioplastics' environmental footprint. Nonetheless, using bio-based resources efficiently is seen as a more sustainable approach given the environmental impact of using non-renewable resources like oil.

00:25:00
In this section, the documentary focuses on the challenges faced by researchers in using wood as a raw material for bioplastics. While wood is available in large quantities, it takes years for fungi to break down its carbohydrates. At Achen University, researchers are working on a solution to this problem, but they are faced with issues like clogged pipes. Biomass has enormous potential, but it still has to compete with petroleum, which has more than a century-long head start. Even if bioengineers produce more sustainable and environmentally friendly products, the plastics manufacturer is skeptical about the potential of bioplastics as the biodegradable kind will not solve the problem of plastic waste.

00:30:00
In this section, the video examines the potential of biofuels and plant-based nutrition to protect the environment and mitigate climate change. While the bioeconomy shows promise in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it may not offer a solution to the plastic problem soon. In the food sector, a German company produces sustainable meat substitutes made primarily from green peas. The founder, a former butcher, emphasizes the importance of sustainability in the supply chain, strives to use recyclable packaging, and insists on no synthetic additives in their products. Plant-based nutrition is seen by experts as one of the most important tools for environmental and climate protection, and some startups are taking a radical approach to producing food from thin air by harvesting CO2.

00:35:00
In this section, the video explores the production of food from thin air using microorganisms in a process developed by Finnish start-up, Solar Foods. The process involves filtering CO2 from the air, adding hydrogen and ammonia to a tank filled with safe microbes, and then drying the tank's contents to produce a yellow powder called Solin, which is rich in protein and can replace vegetable and meat proteins in food products. However, the production currently consumes large amounts of energy, and the dream is to use green energy production such as solar and hydroelectric energy to grow the microbes anywhere, even in deserts. The video acknowledges that Solin's success ultimately depends on consumer support.

00:40:00
In this section, the video discusses the challenges of implementing a bioeconomy and the resistance that it is facing from the fossil fuel industry. Despite technological advances, the bioeconomy still has fundamental limitations as biomass is a limited resource and cannot replace everything produced on a mineral basis. To make progress, consumers need to decrease resource consumption, recycle and reuse more, and make do with less. However, the video ends on a hopeful note about the resilience of ecosystems and the ability to create a desirable future for all.
