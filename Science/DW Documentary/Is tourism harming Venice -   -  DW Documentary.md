Venice is facing many problems, including a lack of infrastructure, increasing costs, and a decreasing population. Many Venetians are unhappy with the city's current state and want to leave for more affordable areas. Tourism is one of the main contributors to these problems, as it causes increased costs for goods and services, as well as increased pollution and congestion.

The documentary suggests that the city's problems are due to a lack of regulation in the tourism industry, and that it is the responsibility of the government to address these issues. It also suggests that the city's appeal is based largely on its location and its history, which are no longer as strong as they once were.

The group is protesting against commercialization and mass tourism, and they've made banners and posters to show tourists how to behave in the city.

One particular issue the group is concerned about is the number of free tour guides in the city, as these guides often charge customers for services. There are currently 234 guides in the city for each one of Venice's residents, and this is causing millions of euros in damages each year.
