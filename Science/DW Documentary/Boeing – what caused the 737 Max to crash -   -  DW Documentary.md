The DW Documentary "Boeing - what caused the 737 MAX to crash?" investigates the tragic crashes of two brand-new 737 MAX planes within five months of each other, leading to the deaths of 346 people. The video raises questions about whether the crashes were more than just accidents and suggests that a deeper issue may have penetrated the company's internal structure. It uncovers a design flaw of the plane that was supposed to increase competitiveness with Airbus, prioritizing cost-cutting measures over adequately training pilots for the new 737 MAX model, the close relationship between Boeing and the FAA, and the corporate culture at Boeing that contributed to the 737 MAX crashes. The video ends by indicating that the tragedy could lead to a self-cleaning process for the aviation industry, in which safety will be valued more highly than profits.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
In this section, a tragic turning point is explored for Boeing, as two brand-new 737 MAX planes crashed in less than five months, resulting in the deaths of 346 people. The victims' families share their heart-wrenching stories of losing loved ones, including Marie Philip, a young woman dedicated to making the world a better place. The documentary also raises questions about whether the crashes were more than just accidents, and suggests that a deeper issue may have penetrated the company's internal structure. Some Boeing insiders report feeling abandoned by regulators and facing threats and violence.

In this section, we see how Boeing's 737 MAX plane crashed into the sea near Indonesia, and it soon came to light that the cause was not just a simple technical defect but a flight computer system. The families of the victims have filed lawsuits against Boeing as they do not want the company to get off the hook without an explanation of what caused the crashes. Shortly after the first crash, the US air traffic regulator, the FAA, prepared a risk analysis that predicted 15 crashes over 45 years. Three months after this analysis, the second crash occurred killing 156 people. The MCAS was developed to compete with a new version of the A320 from Airbus, which was an immediate hit, and Boeing ran the risk of falling behind and needed less fuel-hungry engines requiring a larger size.

In this section of the video, it explains the design flaw of the Boeing 737 Max, which was supposed to increase competitiveness with Airbus by building an economy version of the 737-800. This decision forced the engine to be mounted forward and higher, leading the aircraft to pull upward when subjected to high thrust. Due to this, an additional software system known as MCAS was installed, which, in both crashes, had pushed down the plane too far and forcefully. The 737 Max was also found to be unable to fly and stay airborne on its own. The trimming of the aircraft was adjusted by an onboard computer without pilots' knowledge, making it difficult for pilots to fly the plane. The video discusses how Boeing was aware of these flaws, yet kept them hidden, which is not an acceptable airplane design. The video suggests that other Boeing models might have similar problems.

00:15:00
In this section, it is revealed that Boeing prioritized cost-cutting measures over adequately training pilots for the new 737 MAX model. The company marketed the MAX as being practically the same as its predecessor, with the only difference being the gear handle, and even dissuaded regulators from demanding simulator training. As a result, pilots were not fully prepared for the new software system, MCAS, which ultimately led to two deadly crashes. Despite this, no simulator training was developed for this purpose. Furthermore, post-crash investigations uncovered additional technical problems with the MAX, suggesting that the FAA failed to properly regulate Boeing.

00:20:00
In this section, it is revealed that the FAA and Boeing had a close working relationship, leading to the FAA becoming lax in its oversight of the aircraft certification process. The EASA, the European counterpart of the FAA, collaborated closely with the FAA and fell for Boeing's misleading information on the MCAS system being non-safety-critical. However, after the MAX accidents and its subsequent grounding, the EASA now promises to be more independent and perform a complete assessment of the flight controls of the MAX without relying on the FAA. A Boeing employee had previously reported safety concerns to the FAA, but the relationship between the two companies presents limitations on whistleblowers.

00:25:00
In this section, a Boeing employee who worked on the production of the 787 Dreamliner reported that parts repeatedly showed up in the plant from suppliers that did not correspond to the design drawings and were installed despite not meeting specifications, posing a safety risk. The engineer reported the issue to the FAA and Boeing's head of safety but feels that not enough action was taken. The employee also reported his concerns to the European EASA, but the agency does not have the ability to investigate independently since it is not responsible for manufacturing defects. This raises concerns about the ability of regulators to sufficiently check and ensure the safety of Boeing's planes, especially since many insiders have been warning of dangerous Boeing planes for a long time.

00:30:00
In this section, the documentary covers the concerns of longtime Boeing employees who fear that the Dreamliner aircraft may not be as safe as it needs to be. Cynthia Kitchens and John Barnett report quality defects, and anyone who dares to point out the defects is faced with considerable problems, including being bullied and harassed. They both turned to the FAA and photo-documented the defects in the aircraft. Further investigations reveal that Boeing had also discovered these defects in 2017, claiming that the FAA had investigated them and found they did not pose a safety of flight issue. However, Engineer John Barnett is uneasy and fears the next couple of years could reveal significant defects, threatening the safety of the Dreamliner.

00:35:00
In this section, the documentary explores the corporate culture at Boeing that contributed to the 737 MAX crashes. Internal emails revealed a systemic culture of prioritizing meeting schedules and low-cost suppliers over quality. Some blame this culture on Boeing's acquisition of McDonnell Douglas in the late 1990s, which brought in executives who were focused on profits rather than safety. However, the entire aviation industry was changing at the time with the growth of low-cost airlines and a ticket price war that led to manufacturers designing aircraft with built-in safety risks. While some insiders and pilots like David Schöne see the problem as larger than just Boeing, the company's corporate culture has undoubtedly had catastrophic consequences for the MAX and could potentially harm other Boeing planes in the future.

00:40:00
In this section, the focus is on the aftermath of the 737 Max crashes, which caused 346 deaths. Some people see the crashes as a wake-up call and believe the tragedy will lead to a self-cleaning process for the aviation industry, in which safety will be valued more highly than profits. The families of the victims are calling for proper oversight and control mechanisms to be put in place once again in order for flying to become safer.
