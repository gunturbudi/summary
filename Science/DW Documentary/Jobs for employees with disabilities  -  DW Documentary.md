In this section, the video explores the employment opportunities available for people with disabilities. While some work in sheltered workshops, which employ disabled people for simple tasks, others look for regular jobs in the market. Sharaman Sribalan, who works at a sheltered workshop due to his cognitive and physical disabilities, dreams of designing sustainable cars someday, but he knows that revealing too much about his aspirations could lead to negative criticism. On the other hand, Barbara Yasinski has already achieved her goal of landing a job in the regular job market after working hard for it. She is now happy to work in a daycare center for pensioners.

Barbara is working as an assistant in a daycare center and while there have been some challenges, she enjoys the work and would like to remain in the sector.

However, the coach is optimistic about his chances of finding work and has lined up some interviews for internships.
