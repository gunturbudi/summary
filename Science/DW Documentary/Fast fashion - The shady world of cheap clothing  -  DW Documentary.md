The documentary "Fast Fashion - The Shady World of Cheap Clothing" looks into the dark side of the fashion industry, where workers are paid very little and work in poor conditions. The documentary also reveals that many brands are still producing clothing in countries with poor working conditions, despite the efforts of some sustainable brands to break away from the fast fashion industry.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Fast fashion is a huge business, and one that has engendered a rise in informality and precarity. It's typical for fashion-forward buyers to never wear outfits they purchase, and with a turnover rate of two hundred models per day, fast fashion is a constant source of new clothes for consumers. Zara, a once small Spanish brand that has become a global giant, is one of the leaders in disposable fashion. Zara launches 65,000 new products every year and replaces three quarters of its collection every month.

In this video, DW interviews a number of designers who discuss the pressures they feel to produce similar designs to those seen on the shelves of cheap clothing stores, and the harm this can do to the quality of their work. One designer describes how they were forced to redesign a product after being told it was too similar to another brand's design.

Fast fashion is a type of clothing where clothes are cheaply made and often available in limited quantities. Danish company Reigns sued Spanish company Zara for copying one of their jackets, and the case went to court. Zara was found guilty and had to pay out damages and agree not to imitate Reigns products again. Social media stars like Kamikalon and Noholita use influencer marketing to get their products in front of more people, and the higher profile of an influencer increases the chances of them being successful.

In this documentary, Fast fashion is described as a shady world where cheap clothing is made. Ultra-fast fashion companies like Boohoo rely on influencers to sell their products, and the documentary reveals that many of these products are made in extremely fast delivery times in locations like Leicester, England.

Fast fashion is defined as clothing that is designed, produced, and delivered within two weeks. The documentary follows journalist Tanya as she goes undercover to investigate the shady world of cheap clothing in Leicester, England. Tanya finds that many workers are employed on an hourly basis and are paid little or no compensation, while the factories are often cold and unheated. The documentary also reveals that fast fashion has led to a rise in informality, as workers are sent home without pay after their shift is over.

In this video, DW looks into the shady world of fast fashion, where cheap clothing is produced by workers who are essentially "on a system of informal zero hour contracts," with no guarantee of a contract tomorrow. While some labels have shifted production to other countries, such as Boohoo, which has seen its sales double in 2019, other brands, like ASOS and Boohoo, still produce clothing in countries with poor working conditions, such as the textile industry, which is the second biggest polluter in the world.

This video explores the shady world of cheap clothing, and particularly the toxic solvent carbon disulfide or cs2. This chemical is used to create viscose fiber, and although it is marketed as a green product, it is in fact extremely toxic. The danger emanates from the fumes produced when cs2 is added to wood pulp, and it has caused numerous health problems in workers over the years. The documentary also interviews Ashok Porval, a 58-year-old worker who suffered a heart attack allegedly due to his job at the company. Although the company is responsible for his condition, there is little that can be done to hold them accountable as they have used legal avenues to avoid responsibility.

In this documentary, officials in a small village near a polluting industrial plant demand a study of the effects of pollution on the health of workers. Residents have been complaining of health problems for years, but the authorities only took their complaints seriously after doctors arrived to examine residents. The documentary also features a family with three members who are physically disabled as a result of exposure to pollution. The industry wants us to believe that it has increasingly sustainable credentials, but in reality the lifespan of a fast fashion garment is short and not only because in some cases things are only worn once and then discarded.

The video discusses the negative effects of fast fashion, which often results in clothing that is cheaply made and wears out quickly. The documentary also explores the small, sustainable brands that are trying to break away from the fast fashion industry. Despite these efforts, fast fashion is likely here to stay.
