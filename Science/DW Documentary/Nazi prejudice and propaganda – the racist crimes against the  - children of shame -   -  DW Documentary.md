The DW Documentary "Nazi Prejudice and Propaganda - The Racist Crimes Against the 'Children of Shame'" discusses how Nazi propaganda aimed to eliminate any "inferior gene" from their society which included mixed-race children of German and African descent born out of colonial occupation. The documentary covers the Black Shame campaign, which projected blame for Germany's defeat onto the participation of African soldiers and depicted black men as a threat to white women, leading to widespread societal ostracization of children fathered by colonial soldiers and their mothers. The documentary also highlights Nazi legislation aimed at legalizing and legitimizing eugenic forced mass sterilization and depicts the harrowing experiences of some German children who were forcibly sterilized during the Nazi regime.

Detail Summary:

In this section, we see how children of mixed German and African descent born out of colonial occupation were regarded as inferior by the Nazis and forcibly sterilized in the summer of 1937 under the guise of medical exams. This practice was part of the Nazi propaganda that aimed to eliminate any "inferior gene" from their society. One such child was Willie Bart, who was forcibly sterilized before even turning 14 and was later drafted into the German army during World War II, where he served for only 14 days before dying in northern Italy in 1944.

In this section, it is explained how France deployed a large number of African troops during World War I due to their fear of an imminent defeat by Germany. The German propaganda during the war painted these colonial troops as barbaric and animalistic, further fueling the already-existing racist attitudes. The situation was given a new spin post-war when colonial troops were stationed in the Rhineland, reversing the established colonial hierarchy and causing deep-seated racism among Germans. The sense of crisis after the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II was compounded when the old guardians rejected the new democracy, pushing for a return to the old order. This led to a campaign against what they called "black shame", with fake news reports and disinformation being used as propaganda to ignite the smoldering German rage against the French occupiers.

In this section, we learn about the Black Shame campaign that spread throughout Germany after World War I. It was a propaganda campaign directed at overturning the conditions of the Versailles peace and aimed to re-establish international solidarity with Germany. However, what's interesting about this campaign is that it projected blame for the war's defeat onto the participation of African soldiers, who were depicted as a threat to white women due to their primitive race, inability to control their desires, and strong sex drive. The depiction of black men as a threat to white women was a widespread idea already present in European minds. High-ranking politicians also supported the protests against the presence of colonial troops on German soil, highlighting the racist and prejudiced attitudes present in German society during this time.

In this section, we see how Nazi propaganda and prejudice were rooted in reports of mass rapes of German women by black colonial troops in the Rhineland, a region of Germany occupied by France after World War I. The German government actively recruited foreigners like Ray Beveridge, an American raised in the white upper class, to support the campaign of spreading tales of "black shame." Racist ideas were widely shared in Europe and around the world, leading to widespread societal ostracization of children fathered by colonial soldiers and their mothers, who were seen as lacking morality and national dignity.

In this section, the video highlights Nazi propaganda and prejudice against mixed-race children referred to as "children of shame". Nationalist propagandists campaigned against women who had voluntary relations with colonial troops and bore their children, calling it "racial defilement" and excluding white women from the collective of the German nation. The concept was that the German population regenerates from within; anyone involved in racial defilement must be excluded from the body of the German people. The authorities saw these children as a potential threat and considered sterilizing mixed-race children to ensure the race remains pure from coloured blood.

In this section, the video discusses the story of Gregor Bartz, who was born in a staunchly Catholic society in 1921, where religion was dominant, and his father is an American infantryman from the Philippines. Despite his mother's young age, her family and the village community protected Gregor from ostracism, to the point of accepting him as an adult in the village. However, he was persecuted under the Nazis' changed demographic policy, which relied on concepts of racial anthropology, and he was prevented from having a family under the "cassettes," the law for the prevention of offspring with hereditary diseases, implemented by the National Socialists.

In this section, the documentary discusses the Nazi's inhumane legislation aimed at legalizing and legitimizing eugenic forced mass sterilization. Exhibitions were held to promote public acceptance of the new law and familiarize Germans with the idea of racial hygiene. Surveys were launched to set up a database on racial biological characteristics covering the entire population, and the need for forced sterilizations was even justified economically. The fear for the racial purity of the German people was the main issue, and Hitler personally gave the secret order to forcibly sterilize Rhineland's so-called occupation children, with a special unit set up under the Nazi secret police to carry out the order.

In this section, the documentary depicts the harrowing experiences of some German children who were forcibly sterilized during the Nazi regime. The children were branded as the "children of shame" and considered unfit to reproduce. Gregor and his mother received a summons to appear before the Gestapo where they were instructed to send him to a nazi camp in a fort located in the Mosel. Sterilization was often forced upon mothers with the threat of re-education that would send the children to concentration camps. The sterilization process left the children traumatized, persecuted, and with scars. Elizabeth Hermann describes the trauma and pain of the sterilization process and how it destroyed her future prospects. Young Villi Bart was never able to tell his life story, but his boyhood friend, Rudolf Miller, wrote down his memories of their time together.

In this section, the transcript excerpt describes a young man named Billy who performed a piece by Bach on his violin while wearing a Nazi uniform. At first, he appears defiant, but then suddenly panics and flees the stage. With encouragement from his friend, he returns and feels a sense of support from the audience, which helps him to look forward to a future with more opportunities.
