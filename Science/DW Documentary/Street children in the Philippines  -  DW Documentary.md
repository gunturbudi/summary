This video sheds light on the struggles of street children in the Philippines, particularly those in Quiapo, Manila. With a proposed lowering of the age of criminal liability and President Duterte's war on drugs, children as young as 9 or 12 years old can face arrest and imprisonment. However, NGOs like Bahay Tuluyan are working to provide community-based interventions to help those in need. Additionally, organizations like those of Irish priest Shay Cullen are rescuing children from inhumane prison conditions and providing them with proper care. Extreme poverty continues to be a factor contributing to the issues faced by street children, with many families struggling to provide for their children and resorting to illegal activities to survive.

Detail Summary:

In this section, we learn about the alarming situation of street children in the Philippines. With 30,000 street children in Manila alone, countless numbers of children living on the streets are exposed to the harsh hand of the law, with high rates of experiencing police violence and torture. Many of these children have very little contact with their families and very high rates of negative contact with the law due to substance abuse among them and their parents' high rates of incarceration. Despite the grim reality, they create a sense of home on the streets and support each other, enduring a very difficult life, including grappling with jails for children, which are small cells with steel bars on the gates and windows, leading to overcrowding.

In this section, we learn about the harsh living conditions of street children in Quiapo, a poor suburb of Manila in the Philippines. These street children face the brunt of President Duterte's war on drugs, which has resulted in the arrest and killing of many poor families accused of being drug dealers. These children even face the possibility of being put behind bars, as there is a proposed lowering of the age of criminal liability from 15 to 9 or 12 years old. However, NGOs like Bahay Tuluyan offer help to street children who are in trouble and undertaking community-based intervention rather than throwing children as young as 12 in detention facilities.

In this section, the video explores the effects of the war on drugs in the Philippines, which has led to the killing of thousands of adults and children by the police. The police in Batasan are shown arresting children for drug-related crimes, with over 1,300 children reportedly arrested in the past two years. The video highlights how these children, who often come from impoverished families, are forced to turn to drug dealing as a means of survival. The fear of being arrested, killed or losing their families is a daily reality for these children, who struggle to receive an education and break free from the cycle of extreme poverty.

In this section, the video explores the issue of street children in Manila, some of whom are as young as 13 or 14 and involved in criminal activities. In an effort to combat this issue, the police often arrest children, but many of them end up in overcrowded shelters that are considered to be prison-like. The problem is compounded by the fact that children often end up back on the streets, even after being released back to their families, and the rescue of street children has become a never-ending cycle. Despite efforts to help these children, extreme poverty continues to be a major factor contributing to the issue.

In this section, the video delves into the case of Raymond and Reinold, who live with their family in terrible conditions and have hardly gone to school. Raymond has been arrested multiple times, including for small crimes such as breaking a windshield, and has previously been held in a youth correctional facility where he cried a lot and was threatened by police. The family is unable to pay for damages caused by their children and may have to send Raymond to an institution where he could potentially take his own life. Organizations like Bahay Tuluyan help mothers navigate the complicated bureaucracy to find their children and prevent them from being needlessly imprisoned.

In this section, we see the daily struggles of two families in the Philippines who live in poverty and must resort to selling second-hand clothing in order to survive. One mother must leave her children behind in a correctional facility, while a father works long hours on construction sites to provide for his children who are often left alone. Priest Shay Cullen takes two boys from the correctional facility to his foundation's shelter outside of Manila where they can receive care and support. It is a glimpse into the harsh reality faced by many street children in the Philippines.

In this section, we see how children in the Philippines are forced to live in inhumane conditions in jails and other facilities when they should be receiving proper care. Shay Cullen, an Irish priest, and activist, has made it his mission to save these children and give them a safe place to call home instead of being imprisoned. The authorities treat these children like criminals, placing them in medieval dungeons with no proper facilities or resources. Some are even subject to torture and electric shocks as punishment for their perceived transgressions. These children learn to survive on their own, working odd jobs to make ends meet and support themselves. The situation is dire, and the government's inaction only perpetuates their suffering.

In this section, we see the impact of the war on drugs in the Philippines with Johnny and Sandra, whose parents are in prison due to alleged drug use. Their grandmother is now their caretaker, but struggles to support the family as she has several other children to take care of as well. We also meet Mary Grace, a 16-year-old who is pregnant because of a lack of access to sexual education and contraception. Abortion is illegal in the Philippines, and she shares a studio flat with her mother and brother, who sleeps outside.

00:40:00
In this section, we hear the story of Mary Grace, a teenage mother who is one of 200,000 teens who will give birth this year in the Philippines. Many of these young mothers have had to drop out of school and live in poverty. Mary Grace's partner is in jail, accused of stealing bottles of Coca-Cola, and she dreams of a better life for her child, one where they will receive an education and not have to face the same struggles she did.
