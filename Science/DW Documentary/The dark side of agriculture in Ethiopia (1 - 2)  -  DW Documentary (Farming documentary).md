The documentary delves into the consequences of foreign investment in Ethiopian agriculture, which has serious social and environmental impacts on the local communities. The rush for "new green gold" by foreign investors who seek fertile farmland as a profitable investment option has led to the displacement of farmers, the degradation of the ecosystem, and food insecurity. Through investigating various agricultural projects in Ethiopia, the documentary team highlights the exploitation of government development programs to acquire land for international investors, displacing local farmers who now rely on food aid to survive. The documentary raises concerns about the negative impact of farming for export crop neglecting subsidies for crops that would provide for Ethiopian people. It calls for a prioritization of small farmer livelihoods and the environment over the short-term interests of international investors.

Detail Summary:

In this section of the video, the narrator arrives in Ethiopia and sees food aid being unloaded at the airport while at the same time food is being exported out of the country. Confused by this, he investigates further and discovers that the Ethiopian government's solution to eradicate poverty and hunger is to invite foreign investors to farm the land, which has been dubbed the "new green gold" by international business people and venture capitalists. The video shows that this push for foreign investment has serious consequences for the local communities and their access to land and resources.

In this section of the video, we see the consequences of foreign investment in agriculture in Ethiopia where investors profit from the fertile land, neglecting the interests of local farmers and the ecosystem. The national park, home to endangered species, is at risk of damage from the commercialization of land. With the help of an environmental journalist, the investigation takes the crew to the western region of Ethiopia where they witness the changing landscape as modern agriculture takes over remote regions where farmers are being displaced, and natural lands are being damaged beyond recovery for centuries to come.

In this section, we see that there is a national park in the Camilla region that is home to many animal species and indigenous people who rely on small farming, fishing, and hunting. However, there is pressure from investors who want to be given land in the park, which is worrying park official Omote. The Saudi Star company is one such investor that is expanding into the national park, which will seriously damage the wildlife and the lives of the local people. When our gal goes out to find information about the government's plans for the park and the company, he is arrested and interrogated by the local security police, who warn him to leave the region if he values his security.

In this section, the documentary explores the reasons why international investors are interested in Ethiopian farmland, which is leading to the displacement of farmers and food insecurity. The spike in food prices, increasing world population, and questions around the availability of fertile land have made agriculture an attractive investment option for institutional investors such as pension funds, insurance companies, and private equity funds. The rush for green gold is affecting the poorest countries the most, with over 55 million hectares of farmland set to be controlled by international investors, an area larger than that of Germany.

In this section, the documentary explores the agricultural investment made by Saudi Arabian company, Saudi Star, in Ethiopia. The company plans to farm an enormous area of 8,000 hectares and has already cleared the land and is currently constructing factories in the area. The documentary team is granted permission to visit the farm area and is escorted by the company's security service. The manager highlights that the living standard is good for the workers, with the company providing services such as healthcare and food services, and the facilities are designed by a Swedish company. However, the documentary also raises concerns about the government's involvement, given the risks associated with investing in land in Ethiopia.

In this section, the video outlines the situation in Ethiopia where the country is exporting rice despite severe poverty and famine. The documentary meets the workers who believe they are doing good for 'the human being' when they are working on agriculture projects. However, the initiative to create jobs and generate profit comes at a cost, with several people displaced from their homes and villages. The annexed indigenous people have been living in the area, which has been granted legal permits, for hundreds of years. Many individuals are too afraid to speak openly about their displacement in fear of ending up in jail or being labeled anti-development.

In this section of the video, it is revealed that small farmers in Ethiopia are being forced off their land and relocated to new villages. These relocations, officially termed "villagization," are justified by the Ethiopian government as a means of providing development programs to the locals, such as clean water, healthcare, and school. However, the farmers who have lost their land now rely on food aid to survive. The Development Programme PBS is meant to help the poorest, but it appears that the Ethiopian government is exploiting it to clear land for international investors. PBS is funded by the US, the European Union, and the World Bank, with the latter having put over 2 billion dollars into Ethiopia, with the mission of ending extreme poverty and building prosperity.

In this section, the PBS program discusses the trade-offs involved in development projects and emphasizes the importance of delivering quality projects without jeopardizing the environment or people's livelihoods. It is noted that in Ethiopia, three million people already survive on food aid, and development projects should aim to benefit society at large without creating further losses. The documentary then examines land investors in Ethiopia and emphasizes how small farmers can be severely disadvantaged when they lose their land. The documentary raises questions about how such investors can help the country, particularly when they only visit the area once a year, and the importance of prioritizing the livelihoods of local farmers.

00:40:00
In this section, the documentary explores the issues of farming in Ethiopia and the difficulties faced by farmers due to the need for expansion. The desire to increase foreign exchange has led to the promotion of export crops, which has resulted in neglect of subsidies for the crop's growth in high-nutrient soil. The documentary emphasizes the importance of farmers having a competitive mentality to increase production, as well as the need to prioritize the mentalities of those working the land over the investors.
