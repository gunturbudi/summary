# Summary of Istanbul earthquake - Risk and early warning | DW Documentary

The high risk of a devastating earthquake in Istanbul, Turkey, due to its location between two continents and rapid population growth, is explored in this DW Documentary. Despite efforts from seismologists to develop new prediction methods, the lack of disaster-resistant buildings and an effective emergency plan leaves the city vulnerable to catastrophe. Early warning systems are in place, but offer just a few seconds of warning to residents, and the challenge of retrofitting thousands of buildings to be earthquake-resistant remains. Efforts are being made by non-profits and the city government to prepare citizens and limit damage, but funding and infrastructure remain significant obstacles.

Detail Summary:

In this section, the focus is on Istanbul's high risk for an earthquake due to its location between Europe and Asia and the continuous growth of the population. The lack of disaster-resistant buildings and the absence of an effective emergency plan leave the city even more vulnerable, with a potential similar earthquake to the one in 1999 expected to come. Seismologists are developing new methods for predicting these disasters; however, long-term forecasting risks could create chaos in the city. Outside of Turkey, scientists monitor the earth's crust under Istanbul and investigate new seismological data.

In this section, it's explained that a powerful earthquake could potentially hit Istanbul as a result of plates along the coast being stuck and not being able to move alongside one another, causing energy to accumulate that could be released through a violent earthquake. Seismologists predict that such an earthquake could result in 30,000 to 80,000 deaths and a potential tsunami. While Istanbul already has early warning systems in place, they are only available to the disaster management team and offer a limited warning period of just 5 seconds, leaving residents unable to escape in the event of a quake. However, experts are working on a new method to predict powerful earthquakes using a series of indicators that can be observed before an earthquake hits, and receiving warnings in real time could be revolutionary in terms of earthquake prevention.

In this section, students in Istanbul practice earthquake drills and learn about emergency preparation from instructor Cenk Tankal. Mustafa Murteza, a civil engineer for the municipality, explains how to ensure infrastructure can withstand earthquakes, demonstrating the safety measures being taken during the expansion of a subway line across unstable ground on the European side of the city. However, despite these measures, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake hits the city, damaging many buildings and prompting Tayfun Kahraman, the head of earthquake risk management for the city, to admit that the warning system did not activate, highlighting the need for more stations and repairs.

In this section, the documentary focuses on the efforts of the non-profit foundation MAG-DER, which has been working towards preparing the residents of Istanbul for earthquakes for the last two decades. The new city administration supports the foundation’s objectives of training volunteers in each district to form a civilian disaster rescue team. However, disaster management expert Özden Işk emphasizes that the people must be prepared for earthquakes to avoid panic, which can cause more harm than good. Meanwhile, at the German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam, seismologist Marco Bohnhoff develops a method to predict earthquakes by simulating the process at an accelerated rate to recreate a complete cycle from one quake to the next within a few minutes.

In this section, the importance of earthquake-resistant infrastructure and adapting to comply with earthquake-resistant standards is highlighted. While Japan invests a lot of money in earthquake-resistant construction, this kind of technology can't be afforded by Istanbul. Three factors to consider in earthquake-prone areas, such as Istanbul, are the probability of an earthquake, the number of buildings and people, and the quality of the construction. The section also emphasizes the urgent need to limit the potential damage from a mega-earthquake in Istanbul, and this is demonstrated through the documentation of the Bakirkoy neighborhood, where many old buildings are at high risk. The lack of funding for building renovation is the reason why unsafe buildings are still inhabited, and this poses a significant threat, especially concerning fires that could be ignited by natural gas leaks.

In this section, the documentary delves into the issue of the safety of buildings in Istanbul, with nearly 50,000 buildings deemed at risk of damage even from a mild earthquake. The city is growing rapidly, which only increases the risks and poses a huge threat to the lives of citizens. While the government offers TV commercials raising awareness about earthquakes, the reality is far from idyllic with constant traffic jams and more high-rise buildings. The new city government and German seismologist Marco Bohnhoff are seeking solutions, and Bohnhoff's team has already established seven measuring stations in the Marmara region. A mobile app was also developed to provide early warnings, but its appointment for support was delayed.

00:30:00
In this section, two different approaches to earthquake early warning in Istanbul are presented. Alper Göknar has developed a mobile app that sends a warning signal to users a few seconds before a major quake using six measuring stations in the Marmara region. However, German seismologist Marco Bohnhoff aims to warn the population hours before a quake and has set up a measuring station in Büyükada island to help with his forecasts, which requires drilling 300 meters deep into the earth and is much more expensive. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, but they both agree on the importance of early warning systems to save lives.

00:35:00
In this section, the documentary explores the difficulties faced by the team drilling underground to install seismographs in Istanbul to monitor earthquakes. Despite the challenge of drilling into the hard stone and replacing drill heads, once the seismographs were set up, they sent data to the disaster management authority almost instantly. However, the team also faced issues with the sensors not sending data to the central station, requiring the maintenance team to troubleshoot the RAM. Meanwhile, an Istanbul geologist and app developer discuss using cell phones to measure shaking and estimate damage after an earthquake. The geologist shares his skepticism about earthquake prediction, citing the lack of infrastructure and space in Istanbul to evacuate people and ensure their safety.

00:40:00
In this section, researcher Marco Bohnhoff discusses his findings regarding the mini-quakes that accumulated under the Sea of Marmara before the 5.8 magnitude quake in September. He estimates that it will take another one to two years to see if his method is correct in predicting larger earthquakes, and then scientists can work on developing a reliable forecasting system. The aim is to create a "fever curve" that estimates the risk of an earthquake each day, similar to forecasting extreme weather. The priority for Istanbul should be to have earthquake-resistant buildings, public warnings, seconds before a quake, and longer-lead forecasting. The researchers' work is a race against time.
