The video discusses the 1997 Asian financial crisis, which was the first major global financial crisis in the modern world. The crisis was caused by rapid economic growth in Asia, which led to increased borrowing and investment in Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries. When the Thai currency crisis spread to other countries, the global financial system threatened to collapse. Lessons learned from the crisis were not fully taken into account 10 years later, leading to another global financial crisis.

In the 1980s, the World Bank and IMF began to advocate for a neoliberal restructuring of the international financial system, which led to the growth of the world economy. This growth was possible due to the influx of new, debt-fueled investors into the global economy. However, in 1997, the Asian crisis led to the collapse of the economies of Thailand, Indonesia, and South Korea. This event marked the beginning of the end for neoliberalism, as it brought the global economy to its core instability.

The video discusses the causes of the first modern financial crisis, which began in Thailand in 1997. Financial institutions became over-reliant on short-term loans, and when the exchange rate for Thai baht to U.S dollar began to drop, investors became worried and sold the assets they had bought. This caused a domino effect, leading to a worldwide financial crisis.

The video discusses how the global financial crisis started in Thailand and affected other parts of Asia. The IMF's strategy of forcing countries to stifle investment and consumption caused a recession in Thailand and Indonesia, and threatened to spread to other parts of Asia. Japanese government officials are working hard to prevent a recession in their country.

The documentary discusses the 1997-1998 global financial crisis, which was caused by reckless borrowing and banking practices. Despite clear warning signs, international institutions were ineffective in preventing the crisis. The collapse of the stock market and subsequent recession were eventually defeated by the United States' willingness to deploy large amounts of money.

This video discusses the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, which began when Thailand's currency, the Juan, plummeted in value. Many banks and companies in Thailand were unable to repay their loans, leading to a widespread economic collapse. In order to prevent a global depression, the IMF and other international organizations put together a bailout package for Korea. This involved the US government providing 55 billion dollars, the highest sum ever approved. At the same time, the US Treasury Secretary, Robert Rubin, asked the banks to lend Korea more time to repay their loans. This effort helped to prevent a full-blown depression in Korea.

In 1997, a commercial bank crisis in the US led to fears of a global economic crisis. The IMF was called in to help, and in 1998, South Korea recovered much sooner than Indonesia. However, society as a whole was going through a nightmare, with a homeless problem, increased suicide rates, and a collapse in small and medium businesses.

The video discusses the events that led to the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, which started in the East Asian region. The crisis was caused by a series of financial scandals, including the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and was eventually resolved by a combination of government intervention and IMF loans. Since the crisis, the IMF has been focused on proposals for how countries in difficulty can become prosperous economies again.

The video discusses the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s, which was a stark reminder of the dangers of global financial instability. The crisis of 2008-2009 was a direct result of the Asian financial crisis, and it is now known that any modern global crisis will have a global impact.
