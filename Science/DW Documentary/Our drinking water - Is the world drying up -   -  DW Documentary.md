The world's freshwater supply is under threat due to climate change, rising demand from industries, agriculture, and growing populations, making access to freshwater increasingly limited. The loss of Swiss glaciers because of global warming is leading to the steady decline of freshwater supply for millions of people, and other regions around the world face similar challenges. To solve this problem, researchers are exploring new technologies and studying prehistoric knowledge to sustainably protect drinking water. Sustainability and protecting drinking water are emphasized as social and economic issues, not just ecological ones, that require research and interdisciplinary collaboration to find solutions.

In this section, the video outlines the current state of the world's freshwater supply and how it is being impacted by climate change. With rising demand from industry, agriculture, and the world's growing population, coupled with the fact that almost all of the Earth's water is saltwater, access to freshwater is becoming increasingly limited. Researchers are exploring new technologies and studying prehistoric knowledge in order to sustainably protect our drinking water, recognizing the importance of this precious resource for all living beings. The video highlights Swiss glaciers as a vital source of freshwater for millions of people but sadly, Switzerland's glaciers are losing 2 percent of their mass each year and the prognosis for the next 100 years is not optimistic because of global warming.

In this section, glaciologists are shown measuring the amount of snowfall in the Swiss Alps and evaluating various scenarios for the future of alpine glaciers. The team expects the glaciers to have melted away entirely by the year 2100 if global warming continues at the current rate, which could have major consequences for the water supply. The melting ice would provide more water in the short term but, in the long run, water from the glaciers would be sorely missed since they serve a storage function and collect snow in winter that is released as water in summer. When the glaciers are no longer there, summers will only have water when it rains, which could be problematic given the increasing frequency of droughts. One countermeasure could be to collect the melted glacier water in man-made reservoirs, but it is also important to consider the value of nature and whether we should leave landscapes like these as they are.

In this section, the documentary discusses the importance of allowing rivers to have enough space to overflow their banks during flooding. This is an effective means of flood protection that can also replenish and clean the groundwater without the need for expensive construction efforts. However, competing interests make it difficult to reactivate these natural cycles, such as the case in the Kamah region where locks, irrigation canals, and saltwater lagoons have disrupted the river delta's natural course. The documentary also highlights the issue of rising sea levels and their effects on river deltas, such as the Rhone no longer flushing enough sediment into the delta to stop surges from the rising sea. Saltwater intrusion is also shown to be a problem for coastal areas where the intrusion of salt water into groundwater can have negative effects on drinking water supplies. The state office for mining energy and geology in Hanover is shown to be using high-tech equipment to determine the boundary between salt water and fresh water underground in Lower Saxony, which has 750 kilometers of coastline on the North Sea.

In this section, the documentary focuses on the use of technology to locate and map freshwater reserves underneath the earth's surface. By using electromagnetic measuring techniques, researchers can create detailed images of the distribution of specific electrical conductivity underground, which provides information on the composition of the aquifer, subsoil, and dissolved salts in the groundwater. This data is fundamental for local water suppliers and can help regions that suffer from a lack of fresh water. The research expedition in the Mediterranean aims to locate and map previously unknown deposits of fresh water in the seabed that could be used to supply drinking water.

energy and is expensive, which is why researchers are searching for new sources of freshwater, such as offshore reservoirs. In this section of the video, scientists conduct various experiments on an expedition in Malta's seabed, including taking water samples, using seismic devices, and collecting sediment cores to test for possible traces of fresh water. The researchers are specifically looking for offshore freshwater reservoirs, which could provide a sustainable source of drinking water for Malta and other coastal countries around the world that face shortages. Reverse osmosis, currently used in Malta, is expensive and consumes a lot of energy, but it has allowed Malta to produce 60% of the water required by its population.

00:25:00
In this section, the documentary discusses how Malta has strategically placed its desalination plants around the island to ensure that they can always meet the island's demand for drinking water. However, producing fresh water through reverse osmosis requires ten times as much energy as using natural water resources elsewhere, which affects the price. The documentary suggests that in the future, scientists will need to find more energy-efficient ways of powering these plants and treating their waste products. Furthermore, Keith Buhajar, an archaeologist at the University of Malta, suggests that it is essential to harvest every drop of rainwater available, even today, in light of climate change. He also suggests that Malta can learn from its ancient water systems, ranging from prehistoric waterholes to the subterranean canals of the middle ages, to solve the current water supply problem.

00:30:00
In this section, two examples are given of historical water systems that are being reconsidered in light of climate change. In Malta, engineers are looking to reopen medieval water tunnels that helped the island survive long periods without rain. In Lima, residents are reactivating Incan-built narrow channels called "amunas," which divert water from mountain streams to selected areas where it can slowly seep into the soil instead of creating floods. These examples show that traditional techniques can offer valuable solutions for modern climate challenges.

00:35:00
In this section, we explore the engineering system designed by indigenous peoples that stores precious water resources underground through the amunas, which helps supply water to communities during the dry season. Researchers at Imperial College London conducted a field trial and found that water poured into the canals could be tracked and emerged later as groundwater and springs, helping some Andean villages increase their water supply for agricultural purposes. The principles behind the amunas could be scaled up to increase water supply to Lima during the dry season. Meanwhile, scientists from the Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Geomar completed measurements on the seafloor in Malta to understand the dynamic of how groundwater is trapped underground and could help us understand whether these bodies of groundwater are still connected to the land and can be refilled from there.

In this section, the importance of sustainability and protecting drinking water is highlighted as a social and economic issue, not just an ecological one. The effects of climate change on access to fresh water and the price of drinking water in certain cities or areas are discussed. Research and interdisciplinary collaboration are recommended as critical for promoting understanding and finding solutions. Water conservation is suggested as something that can be practiced on many levels, and it's emphasized that preventing the drying up of our water sources is a challenge for the entire global community.
