The importance of touch in our mental and physical health is explored in this video. From birth, touch is essential for human development, and individuals who lack it may suffer from psychological and physical damage. Touch can trigger the release of growth-promoting processes in the body, reduce heart rate, and stimulate relaxation. The rewards system in our brain is responsible for our desire for touch, with hormones released varying depending on the type of touch. Oxytocin, known as the cuddle hormone, can create feelings of security and emotional bonding. The lack of physical touch due to the pandemic has led to loneliness, and researchers are investigating methods of making long-distance touch possible through the development of soft and flexible skin interface platforms. The importance and uniqueness of the sense of touch are discussed, with emotional touch becoming more pleasurable as people get older.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
In this section, the importance of touch in human life is discussed, particularly from birth. Babies rely heavily on touch to interact with the world and strengthen the bond between themselves and their parents. Touch strengthens our sense of belonging and is a fundamental necessity, just like air or food. However, touch can also communicate power and violence, which is why humans have a highly differentiated system for perceiving and classifying touch. Researchers are currently investigating the subtle nuances of touch in human communication.

In this section, the video explores the importance of touch in creating deeper emotional connections and building relationships. The lack of touch due to the pandemic has created barriers and affected social relationships, especially for younger people who are still learning how to interact. Neuroscientist Rochelle Ackerlyâ€™s research indicates that touch is essential for life and development, right from the beginning. When newborns do not experience touch, they suffer irreparable psychological and physical damage, reduced body growth, and underdeveloped immune systems. Physical contact stimulates growth and sets important developmental processes in motion by reacting and producing small currents that reach different regions of the brain via dense network.

In this section, the video explores how touch affects our physical and mental health. Touch triggers the release of growth-promoting processes throughout the body, leading to physical changes such as muscle relaxation, a decrease in heart rate, and shallower breathing. The research also shows that when we are gently touched, like during a massage, the brain waves slow down, resulting in a state of relaxation. Scientists have also discovered special nerve fibers in the skin that register whether we liked the touch or not, providing insight into the significant role that touch plays in our social lives. These discoveries have led to the realization of an entirely new sensory system.

In this section, the role of touch in regulating the reward of social contact for groups is explored. Sea tactile afferents, which are nerve fibers that give us a sense of positive touch, respond to low force and slow stroking velocity, as opposed to fast or slow stroking, and become optimally activated when gently caressed. The sensation of touch also depends on the situation and the person who is being touched. When individuals touch themselves, their brain suppresses the feeling as it already knows what to expect. Finally, it is suggested that people touch themselves constantly, between 400 to 800 times a day, mostly on their face.

00:20:00
In this section, researchers perform a study to assess the neurophysiological changes in the brain caused by touch stimuli. They instructed test subjects to feel different patterns on small plates and record them later, without knowing they were being filmed. The subjects were then stressed with disturbing noises, making them feel overwhelmed and leading to self-touching. The evaluation of brain waves showed that short touches regulate brain activity, enabling the test subjects to focus better. However, the question of where the impulse to touch ourselves comes from remains unclear. Rebecca Buma is investigating the role of the spinal cord in processing touch stimuli.

In this section, the documentary explores how our brains perceive touch and how it affects our physical and mental health. The interaction between the brain and body was previously disregarded in neuroscience, but the documentary reveals the importance of both. The spinal cord plays a role in deciphering touch, and the brain recognizes the intentions of touch. The reward system in our brain is responsible for the desire for touch, and the hormones released by our brain vary depending on the type of touch. Oxytocin, known as the cuddle hormone, plays an important role in forming social bonds, regardless of whether the relationship is based on family, friendship, or sexual attraction.

00:30:00
In this section, the video discusses the benefits of the hormone oxytocin, which is released during physical touch and is known to create feelings of security and emotional bonding in individuals. Couples with long-term elevated oxytocin levels also tend to live longer, have better stress management, lower blood pressure, higher pain tolerance, and are better learners. However, oxytocin also has side effects and reinforces the feeling of defending one's group against others, making it more difficult to feel connected to individuals outside of one's group. The video also discusses the impact of social distancing on mental health and how the lack of physical touch may have led some individuals to seek out substitutes for that reward, such as overeating or overdrinking.

In this excerpt, a study is described where test subjects were given text message questions about their physical contact and stress levels while saliva samples were taken to measure stress hormones. The results showed that pleasant touch dramatically decreases stress hormones, making it a buffer against permanent stress that can be harmful to our health. Additionally, touch can also inhibit acute pain by sending positive and negative signals to the brain simultaneously, resulting in a calming effect. The study suggests that touch has a very positive influence on our mental and physical health.

In this section, the video explores the importance of physical touch for our mental and physical well-being. While touch can help with both physical and emotional pain, the increasing digitalization of our lives means we are experiencing less and less physical contact with each other, leading to a mass phenomenon of loneliness with serious health consequences. The pandemic has only further reinforced this tendency, with most of us relying on digital devices for communication. However, researchers at Northwestern University are working to make long-distance touch possible through the development of soft and flexible skin interface platforms that can be integrated with electronic elements and connect wirelessly to computers, making touching over the internet a potential reality in the future.

In this section, researchers showcase an artificial skin that uses electrical currents to stimulate pressure and vibrations for a tactile experience. While this technology can enhance virtual communication and video games, it cannot replace in-person touch. However, amid the pandemic, it can provide a temporary solution for physical contact for individuals living alone or in long-distance relationships. Lack of touch can lead to a feeling of sadness and depression as we tend to appreciate it less and seek it less over time. As touch plays a crucial role in our emotional and physical health, it is an essential component of our biological makeup that needs to be consistently reinforced throughout our lives.

00:50:00
In this section, the importance and uniqueness of the sense of touch are discussed. While other senses tend to decline with age, touch has two layers: discriminative touch, which decreases with age, and emotional touch, which becomes more pleasurable as people get older. The impact of touch on our mood, health, and relationships is becoming increasingly recognized, as touch can influence our happiness throughout our lives.
