# Summary of The power of the pharmaceutical companies | DW Documentary

The DW Documentary titled "The Power of Pharmaceutical Companies" examines the high cost of cancer treatments and how pharmaceutical companies justify their prices. The documentary features the case of Michael Monstein, a cancer patient whose insurance company is negotiating with Novartis for a discount on Kymriah, a gene therapy that costs CHF 370,000. The film also explores the development of Kymriah, which was initially researched at a university, but Novartis acquired the exclusive sales rights. The cost of these therapies has caused price disputes, with some insurers walking away from negotiations, and patients without insurance or means to afford the treatment left unable to access cutting-edge therapies. The documentary also delves into the lack of transparency within the pharmaceutical industry, lobbying tactics, and the future of expensive therapies for cancer treatment.

Detail Summary:

In this section, the case of Michael Monstein, who suffers from a rare and aggressive form of lymphatic cancer is presented. Monstein’s treatment called Kymriah is a gene therapy with cancer-killing cells that costs CHF 370,000. It is unclear if his insurance, Atupri, will pay for it since the insurer is negotiating with Novartis for a discount. The documentary shows the difficulty both the pharmaceutical companies and insurers have in coming up with a fair price for life-saving medication. Unfortunately, as in Monstein's case, those without insurance or the means to afford treatment remain unable to accessing current cutting-edge treatments. The issue of the affordability of innovative treatments remains unresolved.

In this section of the transcript, a man named Michael Monstein talks about his experience with cancer treatment and the high cost of Kymriah, a drug that uses Immunzellen to fight cancer. The cost of the drug has caused a price dispute and has prevented around a dozen cancer patients from receiving treatment. Critics have blamed both Novartis and the health insurance companies for the situation, but it is clear that a solution has not yet been found. Despite the criticism, Kymriah was approved based on patient studies funded by Novartis, though some experts have criticized the limited scope of those studies.

In this section of the transcript, the documentary explores the issue of pharmaceutical prices and how they are justified by the industry. Although some doctors find the prices “horrendous,” pharmaceutical companies claim that the value of the treatment is what determines the price, and not the cost of production. The Swiss pharmaceutical giant, Novartis, recognized that lowering prices is one of the strategies to remain competitive, yet they insist on patients and health insurers bearing risks in order to make the therapy available. The documentary also highlights how drug companies use philanthropic funds and government grants to fund research and later, profit from them in order to justify the high cost of medicines.

In this section, the transcript discusses the development of Kymriah, a cancer treatment that uses a patient's own immune cells to fight cancer. The concept of Kymriah was developed through university research, and Novartis eventually acquired the exclusive sales rights for the treatment. However, the cost of the treatment is incredibly high, especially compared to what the university charges for its own research on the same treatment. While some patients have received Kymriah free of charge due to various circumstances, the transcript also discusses how expensive cancer treatments can be, and how the high prices may not always be justifiable considering the initial research was funded with taxpayer dollars. The transcript also features an interview with a former pharmaceutical CEO who is currently undergoing cancer treatment himself, and he expresses his disbelief at the high cost of his medication.

In this section, an ex-CEO, Paul Kleutghen, who had worked for a company taken over by Novartis, reveals that the pharmaceutical company benefited from a 50% tax discount from the US government for the research of rare diseases, meaning taxpayers partly paid for costly Kymriah's development. Kleutghen then devises a pricing model for Kymriah, stating the cost should be $200,000 for 1,700 patients across the US and Europe. He also criticizes the lack of transparency within the pharmaceutical industry, while Anton Schlösser, a patient of Kymriah, despite the drug being his only treatment option, is wary of its effectiveness and highlights the challenging question of what a human life is worth.

In this section, the video explores the price negotiations that take place between pharmaceutical companies and health insurance providers in Switzerland. The negotiations for Kymriah, a cancer drug that uses genetically-modified cells to fight cancer, were described as resembling a bazaar, with some insurance providers walking away from the negotiations and others settling for an undisclosed discount. This lack of transparency in pricing is a new phenomenon in the Swiss healthcare system, where cost transparency is seen as important. Additionally, the video highlights the health risks associated with treatments like Kymriah, including organ failure and the need for dialysis. The video also shows financiers and investors attending a health care conference in San Francisco and investing in small biotech firms, hoping to develop new cancer drugs that can be sold to pharmaceutical giants for a profit.

00:30:00
In this section, the video highlights the power of pharmaceutical companies in acquiring and investing in biotech firms to bring new medicines to market at high prices. Novartis acquired Avexis and charged a record-breaking $2.1 million for the Avexis therapy, while Gilead bought Kite for almost $12 billion. The cost of producing Kymriah is still high, but Novartis managed to save billions by bypassing biotech firms and investors in the production process. However, the high prices of these therapies have caused issues, as the Swiss government is expected to cover 55% of Kymriah's cost as part of hospital treatment. Meanwhile, in China, the government applies pressure on pharma companies to lower drug prices, which the firms accept to gain access to the Chinese market.

00:35:00
In this section, the documentary explores the concept of Orphan Drugs and market exclusivity. Orphan Drugs are medications for rare diseases, and pharmaceutical companies that develop these drugs receive exclusive marketing rights for up to 10 years, making it difficult for competitors to enter the market. This law was created over 30 years ago, and today, it is criticized for allowing pharmaceutical companies to monopolize the market and overprice their products. The film also delves into the lobbying tactics of these pharmaceutical companies, which illustrates how policymakers are potentially being influenced to favor these companies' interests over the needs of patients.

00:40:00
In this section, we see the aftermath of the therapy and how the patients are doing post-treatment. Both patients are relieved and grateful to go home without masks. However, doctors warn that there is no guarantee that cancer will not return, as data on Kymriah treatments are still too short to draw conclusions. The Novartis study shows that half of the patients still die. Furthermore, the future of cancer-killing cells in the body is still unclear, and Kymriah is only the beginning of expensive therapies with record-breaking promises of hope for survival in a brave new world of medicine.
