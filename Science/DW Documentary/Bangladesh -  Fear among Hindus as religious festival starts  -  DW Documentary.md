The DW Documentary titled "Bangladesh: Fear among Hindus as religious festival starts" showcases the rising tensions between the Muslim majority and religious minorities during the Hindu festival, Durga Puja. The festival has been the target of sectarian attacks, leading to a sense of insecurity among many Hindu people in Kumila, who have built new barriers to protect themselves. Hinduism is a minority religion in Bangladesh, and many rights groups have recorded over 3,000 attacks against minority religions in recent years, but worshipers from several mosques and temples express their desire to live in harmony. Some experts suggest passing a minority protection law or forming a national minority commission to bring the perpetrators to justice and provide more protection to minorities.

In this section, the DW Documentary shows the fear among Hindus in Bangladesh during a religious festival celebration as religious fundamentalism surges in the country. Hinduism is a minority religion in Bangladesh, and they often face communal tensions from Muslim groups. The government has pledged to protect the minority religions' rights, but rights groups have recorded over 3,000 attacks in recent years. However, there seems to be a peaceful coexistence between the different religions in the country, as worshipers from several mosques and temples express their desire to live in harmony. Local clerics and religious leaders also urge the government to bring the perpetrators of last year's riots to justice and spread knowledge that religion does not teach undisciplined behavior.

In this section, it is highlighted that though Bangladesh is a country where people are generally united, fundamentalists are creating conflicts between Hindus and Muslims. The government is not doing enough to prevent such conflicts and provide justice to the victims of riots. The old criminal law from British period requires multiple witnesses and evidence that cannot be managed in many cases, which leads to very few trials. Experts suggest forming a national minority commission or passing a minority protection law to provide more protection to minorities and bring the perpetrators to justice. Meanwhile, a Hindu idol maker remains hopeful for restoring harmony in Bangladesh.
