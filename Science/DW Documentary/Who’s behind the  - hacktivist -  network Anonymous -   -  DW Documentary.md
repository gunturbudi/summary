In this section, different individuals, including Commander X, Anonymous activists, and journalists, provide insights into the life and work of contemporary American activists. Commander X is portrayed as a man who can take you into a whole world and was the personification of the story of how activism moved from the streets to the internet and back to the streets. Furthermore, his difficult upbringing, fascination with computers, and passion for activism are highlighted. The story also touches on the seriousness of some Anonymous' actions, such as the epilepsy foundation hack and the potential real-world harm they could cause, leading to Commander X being tasked with infiltrating the group.

In this section, the documentary explores the origins of the hacktivist group Anonymous, which emerged from the 4chan website's image boards. The boards provided a space for people to talk freely about anything under the cover of anonymity. The movement began as raids for fun, but then, as they realized their power, they transformed into a movement with shared ideals and enemies. The Scientology raid was an example of how their focus shifted towards challenging organizations they saw as doing harm. When a video of Tom Cruise was taken down from the internet, Anonymous, with its core value of free speech, reposted it, attracting a large following. The group's ideas grew from a small collective to a powerful movement and inspired an online army.

In this section, we see how Anonymous came to be known for their signature Guy Fawkes masks and how they gained notoriety through their global protest against Scientology. However, their fight against Scientology was not meant to lead to anything more than a week-long screw-over of the organization. It wasn't until the release of the collateral murder video by WikiLeaks that Anonymous shifted their focus and began targeting companies that were cutting off support to WikiLeaks. Anonymous's method of choice was a denial-of-service attack, which anyone could carry out, and it became their way of affecting change on the internet.

In this section, the documentary explores the early days of Anonymous and how their use of DDOS attacks spread. The weapon they used was a software that allowed them to fire hundreds, if not thousands of downloads to a target, becoming a powerful force. The documentary then pivots to talk about Commander X, a homeless activist who become notorious online after taking down the County website as part of Anonymous. While some sympathized with him due to his limited resources, others saw him as a potential harm to the movement. Despite this, Commander X was seen as a messenger for Anonymous, whose actions showed that they were a force to be reckoned with.

In this section, the documentary explores how Anonymous became involved in the Tunisian revolution in 2011. Some Tunisian hackers approached Anonymous, and while some members were skeptical, others such as Mandarex believed they could help. The hackers claimed to have obtained usernames and passwords to just about everything, including servers for the president’s emails. Anonymous was able to prove that the government were corrupt, and the people were furious. Anonymous helped to keep communication from city to city by building a list of all the technologies that the government would block, and they created proxies to allow people to have access. Anonymous continued their involvement in the region by helping the Egyptians in their revolts and significantly impacting global policy.

In this section, the video discusses how the FBI raided 40 US households in January 2011, targeting alleged members of the hacktivist group Anonymous. Agents hit six homes in New York along with locations across the country, seizing hard drives and computer accessories. However, they were only able to catch 39 of them, as the 40th was identified as "Batman." Visa.com went offline for a few minutes due to one of the DDOS attacks, but it did not affect anyone, yet the FBI was determined to prosecute the offenders. The lawyer who represented the individuals arrested said it was a joke, and a joke will get you prison time.

In this section, we learn about Commander X, a notorious hacker activist who has been accused of hacking into various government systems. He claims that he is a homeless individual who had his electronics confiscated by the FBI, but he is still determined to continue fighting. He has also made claims about Anonymous being the most powerful organization on Earth, which received backlash from other members of the group. Through interviews with Commander X, we get a glimpse into the life of a hacker and the struggles that come with it.

The individual goes through a perilous journey from Southeastern Manitoba to  El Paso before arriving in Guanajuato, Mexico. He believes that he has built up a network of friends and legal paperwork that will aid in his bid for asylum. He accepts the consequences of his actions, knowing that he may never be able to return home again if he is granted asylum. Ultimately, he hopes to make his case and become a permanent resident of Mexico.

In this section, we hear from a member of Anonymous who has been granted political asylum in Mexico. He states that he is the first information activist in history to receive political asylum in a foreign country for protest actions taken under the flag of Anonymous.

While he is unsure about the future of his activism, he thanks his supporters and invites them to tune in to "Anonymous fights back" on Twitter.
