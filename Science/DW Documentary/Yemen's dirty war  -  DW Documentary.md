The documentary "Yemen's Dirty War" highlights the devastating impact of the war in Yemen, which has been ongoing since 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition began bombing the country after the exiled president was ousted. The conflict has led to a dire humanitarian crisis, with diseases such as cholera and malnutrition increasing in frequency and severity, and health facilities being targeted. The blockade of the rebel-controlled area has resulted in strict rationing, with food and wheat shipments delayed for weeks and limited fuel causing truckloads of food to rot. The video also explores the Saudi-led coalition's connections to terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaeda, with evidence indicating that they may be supporting each other in the fight for control of strategic oil rigs. Despite international NGOs taking legal action against arms dealers and pleas for aid, the situation in Yemen remains dire, with more than 17 million people facing food insecurity.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
In this section, the documentary team travels to the rebel-controlled area of Yemen, which is difficult for journalists to reach due to a Saudi-led coalition blockading the area. They make the 15-hour drive to rebel-controlled Sanaa, where life is described as normal by locals, despite the years of war. The documentary highlights the resilience of the people and their determination to stand together against the enemy. Old Sanaa, a UNESCO World Heritage site, has been endangered by the war with houses and families destroyed. The Ansar Allah movement has been pitted against the Saudi and Emirati crown princes since 2015.

In this section, the video discusses the background of Yemen's exiled former president, Abdulrabbu Mansur Hadi, who came to power in 2012 before being ousted by Ansar Allah rebels in 2014. Following this, a Saudi-led coalition including the UAE began bombing the country in 2015, using advanced weaponry that has reportedly been used against civilians. The loss of civilian lives has prompted European NGOs to take action, with arms dealers facing legal proceedings in the UK, Germany, and Italy. French attorney Josef Bream has filed two war crime complaints in Paris against Crown Prince Bin Salman and Crown Prince Bin Zayed following one of the deadliest airstrikes to date, which hit a residential area in Sanaa's outskirts. The bombing took place at a ceremony for the Ansar Allah-appointed minister of the interior where the victims were mostly civilians, while the interior minister may have been the target.

00:10:00
In this section of the video, it is shown that Saudi Arabia offered money to victims of the bombing that killed 193 people during a funeral service to silence them and avoid facing trial. The victims refused the money and joined a French lawyer in a suit against the Saudi and Emirati leaders. A ballistics expert also showed the devastating effects of weapons, including cluster bombs and GBU-12 bombs, that were used in the attacks. The video also highlights the heavy cost of Yemen's dirty war, including the death of innocent children and the impact on the physical and mental well-being of the entire population.

00:15:00
In this section, the devastating impact of Yemen's war on its people's health is highlighted. Congenital anomalies, cholera, cancer, and malnutrition have increased in frequency and severity since the war started, and diseases such as diphtheria have returned. A lack of medical supplies, healthcare workers, and infrastructure, as well as frequent bombings, exacerbates the situation. Despite a dire humanitarian crisis and pleas for aid, funding has fallen short. The people of Yemen suffer while their fate is determined by international powers.

00:20:00
In this section, the video discusses the targeting of health facilities and the August 31, 2019 attack on a former university turned Ansar Allah prison, which resulted in 140 dead prisoners of war, despite theoretically being protected by the Geneva Convention. The attack was allegedly a warning to remind everyone of who was in charge, and may have been carried out to keep control of the prisoners of war. Ansar Allah's army, supported by influential Yemeni businessmen such as Mohammed Ali Al-Huti, has gained ground against the troops of the exiled president and his Saudi supporters, and is said to have around 200,000 men and hand-to-hand combat drones.

00:25:00
In this section, it is shown how the conflict in Yemen is not just a religious dispute between two factions of Islam but is also driven by economic calculations. Yemen's oil reserves, not as large as those of Saudi Arabia, are substantial, and the region's coastline gives it a vital position in international trade. The Bab-el-Mandeb Strait is a key global maritime traffic route and a coveted outlet to the Arabian Sea for Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The war has caused strict rationing despite the country's oil supplies, and months of shortages can only be overcome by smuggling. The survival of northern Yemen is at risk.

00:30:00
In this section, it is revealed that the blockade on Yemen's rebel-controlled area means that Ansar Allah can only obtain oil from one of its enemies, the United Arab Emirates. Ships carrying food and wheat are allowed in, but not fuel transports, causing trucks full of food to rot as they sit idle and fisherman struggle with expensive and limited fuel. The fishing industry of Hodeida, which once supplied half the country with fish, now catches only 10 tons per day due to the danger of war and lack of resources. The embargo on oil facilities has affected health, hospitals, agriculture, transportation, and electricity, with little hope for the situation to improve any time soon.

00:35:00
In this section, the video explores the Saudi-led coalition's approach to fighting the Houthi rebels in Yemen, including the use of Sudanese fighters and bombing of small fishing boats that may or may not be smuggling weapons. The section also raises questions about possible connections between the coalition and terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the role of the coalition in the fight against terrorism. The coalition's relationship with jihadists and terrorists is complicated, with some terrorists, like Al-Qaeda, purportedly benefiting from the conflict, while others, like Peter Sharif, who was allegedly associated with the Paris terrorist attacks, were left unquestioned.

00:40:00
In this section, it is revealed that while the coalition fighting against Ansar Allah in Yemen, which is supported by the UN, US, UK, and France, has repeatedly denied collaborating with Al-Qaeda, evidence indicates otherwise. Ansar Allah's deputy foreign minister claims that Al-Qaeda and ISIS are an integral part of the coalition fighting against them. The coalition and Al-Qaeda are believed to be supporting each other in the center of the country, in Marib, where the battle for control of strategic oil rigs has been ongoing for years. The report identifies Khaled, who was on the US's list of officially wanted Al-Qaeda leaders, as the man at the center of this alliance. The video shows Khaled meeting with Yemeni army officers and former President Hadi's minister of defense, as well as having connections to Alimosan, the former vice president of the government supported by Saudi Arabia and the UAE. These individuals hold important posts within the coalition, including military officials and advisers to the president. The northern authorities sent the UN a list of 11 people suspected of being involved with Al-Qaeda, including Adel al-Abdaani, who commands a coalition brigade in the region.

00:45:00
In this section, we see the dichotomy of France's best allies in the region, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and its biggest enemies, al-Qaeda and ISIS, which may suggest complicity with terrorism. Political calculations and interests have resulted in dire consequences for Yemen's population, with more than 17 million people facing food insecurity. Aiman, a former road builder, and his family fight hunger by volunteering to cook meals for over 200 families every day. Meanwhile, businessman Yaya al-Habari, who supports Anzar Allah, owns several farms and helps victims of hunger. His fortune comes from real estate and grain, and he has donated wheat flour, sugar, and rice for the poor for six years, even if they relied on the World Food Programme.

00:50:00
In this section, a businessman discusses how the UN and its World Food Program claim to send shipments of aid via sea, but it is often delayed for weeks and the quality of the aid is poor. The Yemeni Saudi coalition and Ansarala are both accused of organizing famine against the Yemenis, and the dirty war rages on, killing in silence and going largely unnoticed by the world.
