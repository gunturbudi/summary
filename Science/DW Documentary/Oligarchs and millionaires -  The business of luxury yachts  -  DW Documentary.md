In this section, it is revealed that Russian oligarchs have brought their luxury yachts to Turkey to avoid international sanctions imposed due to the Ukraine crisis, and Turkey provides them a safe haven. However, in other countries such as France, Italy, and the US, the yachts belonging to Russian oligarchs have already been seized. Among these oligarchs is Alexander Abramov, the owner of the Titan, an 80-meter long super yacht. Additionally, Roman Abramovich, Russia's most famous billionaire, owns the Solaris, a yacht that costs over 400 million euros and measures 140 meters long, which is guarded by a team of 20 to 25 with military training. Despite the affluence of these yachts, they have come under scrutiny due to their colossal carbon footprint, consuming about 500 liters of diesel per hour, and contributing to climate change.

In this section, the documentary explores the booming market of luxury yachts in various countries around the world, including Dubai, Saudi Arabia, and Hong Kong.

His son, Nicolas, oversees the technological innovations in the company, creating unique solar panels that can be made into any shape and attached to the yacht's hull. Moreover, Lapp's pride and joy is a 24-meter catamaran designed to be completely eco-friendly and powered solely by wind and solar energy.
