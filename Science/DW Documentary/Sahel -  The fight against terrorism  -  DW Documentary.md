In this section, DW Documentary takes us to the dangerous areas in eastern Mali, where jihadists have controlled the region since 2016. Neither the Malian nor French military has a presence in the area, so locals take matters into their own hands to protect their land. The Dozo, a secretive brotherhood of initiated hunters and warriors, have formed a militia, and  many in the villages have joined them to fight against the jihadists. The Dozo are part of the Dan Na Ambassagou, the most powerful militia in the region with about a thousand soldiers, and their leader, Youssouf Toloba, seeks safety in the rocky cliffs, fearing assassination. Marteau and his men regularly patrol the cliffs, which are the last stronghold against jihadists and must be defended at all costs. Although they live just 20 kilometers away, Marteau and his men only see their families three times a year.

In this section, the video focuses on the fight against terrorism in the Sahel region, where eight countries are plagued by terrorism, especially Mali, where the jihadist group Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb operates under the goal of imposing Sharia law. Mali's ill-equipped and corrupt military is failing to halt the jihadists' advance with the help of French soldiers who have been providing support for a decade. While repeated coups have weakened the Malian government and left large parts of the country neglected, the only country in the Sahel to successfully hold back the jihadists is Mauritania, which is using both modern and traditional methods. The Dan Na Ambassagou militia in the Dogon territory is the only resistance against the jihadists, fighting in a hostile environment with sparse vegetation, food supplies, and temperatures that can reach 45 degrees Celsius in the shade.

In this section, the documentary explores the role of local militias, such as the Dozo and Dan Na Ambassagou, in the fight against terrorism in Mali. These militias, made up of Malian hunters, receive no aid from the government or international troops, and are solely reliant on their own resources and the support of locals. Despite this, they have managed to maintain control of the cliffs and have succeeded in killing jihadists and taking their weapons. The jihadists have carried out devastating raids on villages, burning down homes and stealing everything they could. The cliff represents the last line of defense against the jihadists, and the local militias risk their lives defending it.

In this section, the documentary portrays the story of Marteau and his team of Dozo hunters stationed in a strategic access point in the Sahel to watch out for jihadists' attacks. They are outgunned and outnumbered, but they refuse to leave their land, despite the danger. Every night they set up camp, light fires, and prepare dinner. There is a sense of perseverance and resilience despite the challenging circumstances. The Dozo's role in providing security to vulnerable communities in the Sahel is highlighted, as they are often the only ones protecting these regions against jihadists' raids.

In this section, the detrimental impact of the conflict on the livestock industry and food security in the Sahel is highlighted. As the conflict continues to disrupt the lives of farmers, the cattle population in Mali has suffered, with livestock being stolen by armed groups or forced to migrate into towns, wreaking havoc on crops and increasing the tension between farmers and herders. This has led to a meat shortage in certain areas and driven up prices, making it harder for locals to access sufficient nutritious food. The situation has also made it challenging for butchers to earn a profit, and many have been forced to shut down their businesses.

In this section, the documentary explores the story of Amadou Kouffa, a preacher who became a jihadist leader in central Mali. Kouffa's group, Katibat Macina, influenced by the golden age of the Fulani and the Massina empire, expanded its reach thanks to the support of fresh recruits. The documentary also highlights the impact of jihadism on trade and everyday life in the region, with strict Sharia law implemented on the jihadist-controlled side of the Niger River. Additionally, four former jihadists who had initially joined the movement due to persecution in their villages share their experiences, including the pressure to convert to Salafism and the disappointment when they discovered that the jihadist life was not what they envisioned.

In this section, the documentary highlights Mauritania's fight against terrorism and its efforts to control and secure its borders. The government's strategy includes caring for the population and restructuring its military, which is now considered the most professional in the region. The Air Force plays a crucial role in the fight, using fighter planes that are perfectly suited for the war in the desert terrain. The country has also invested in surveillance technology, such as high-resolution cameras with a range of up to 20 kilometers that can detect vehicles' imprints in the sand to locate the enemy.

00:35:00
In this section, we see how Mauritania is fighting against terrorism through ground troops and special intervention groups, who guard the border with Mali and rely on human intelligence to gain the nomads' trust, a valuable source of information. To gain the grip of the remote parts of the country, the government has also created the citizen police force who travel by camels and have a thorough knowledge of the region and its people. All of these measures have radically changed life for many residents, and animal thefts have stopped with the arrival of military personnel, which can roam as they please, and people can sleep peacefully at night.

In this section, the documentary highlights the importance of water supply and wells in the fight against terrorism in the Sahel region. The camel riding unit is responsible for maintaining wells and the Mauritanian government, and the European Union have financed the drilling of hundreds of new wells. The lack of water can lead to conflict among farmers, but these wells also enable locals to stay in the desert areas that might otherwise become a haven for jihadists from Mali. Locals are a valuable source of information for the military in their intelligence operations, and any suspicious activities are reported straight away.
