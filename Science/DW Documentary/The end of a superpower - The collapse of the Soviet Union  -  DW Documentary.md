The Soviet Union was a major superpower in the world for many years, but its collapse in 1991 was a major event, resulting in the rise of Russia as a global political player. While Russia has regained its status as a global player, it has fallen far short of its potential.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
The collapse of the Soviet Union 30 years ago brought hope of independence and prosperity for the former Soviet republics, but what remains of these streams, what does this new freedom look like, and who has won, who has lost, and what role does Russia play in this post-Soviet power struggle are all questions that remain unanswered.

The collapse of the Soviet Union led to the independence of many formerly Soviet republics, including Armenia. The war between Armenia and Azerbaijan has been ongoing for 30 years, and has never gone away. The peace treaty between Armenia and Azerbaijan is still tentative, and there is still a risk of renewed war.

The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 had far-reaching consequences for the population of the former Soviet states. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, millions of Russians found themselves living in other countries, and with the lack of a clear policy on their part, many were unsure of their status. Ruslan Greenberg, director of the Institute of Economics at the Academy of Sciences, believes that the fall of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.

The Soviet Union dissolved following a series of political and economic problems, leading to the displacement of millions of people and the creation of a "failed attempt" at a federation of independent states. While the Baltic states have fared well in the years since independence from the Soviet Union, inequality and poverty remain major issues.

This video examines the collapse of the Soviet Union, which is seen as a significant event in the history of freedom. The video interviews people about their experiences and explains how the collapse of the Soviet Union has affected Lithuania. The country is now closer to the West and views Russia as a potential aggressor, but is still supported by NATO and the European Union.

The documentary discusses the Russian economy and its problems, as well as Russia's relations with other countries. It mentions the recent focus on Central Asia, and Ukraine in particular, and the ongoing crisis there.

The collapse of the Soviet Union was a defining event in recent history, leading to the rise of capitalist markets and a rise in economic inequality. The video follows the story of a family from eastern Ukraine, which experienced the transition to capitalism firsthand. Many people in eastern Ukraine feel a strong connection to Russia, due to the similarities between their cultures and histories. The protests in Donbass against the national government in Kiev in 2014 turned into a separatist uprising, a civil war that has set the whole of Europe on edge. Crimea, which had been part of the Soviet Union until 2014, was annexed by Russia in a show of strength.

In the late 1990s, Russia was plunged into an economic crisis as older people experienced a rapid decline in living standards and child mortality rates rose to alarming levels. This discredited the concept of democracy and the very term democracy in the eyes of most Russians. Putin's first term in office began in 2000 and he immediately tightened the reins on the country's powerful oligarchs, making clear that a new era had arrived. Most Russians applauded this message and the current ruling party achieved its political aims much like the old communist party did through domination. However, the Russian political establishment is much more flexible than the Soviet one and it is capitalist, but not only Russia has a highly centralized authoritarian government. Take Belarus for example; it was always a reliable ally for Russia due to shared history and related languages, but now it appears shaky. Kazakhstan, too, is the richest country in the region thanks to its oil and gas supplies, yet its long-serving former leader, Nusultan Nazarbayev, was a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party in Soviet times.

In the video, DW discusses the collapse of the Soviet Union and how it led to the mass migration of millions of people from central and eastern Europe to Russia. Many of these people work in the service sector or in agriculture, and their wages are often the most important source of income for their families back home. Islam in the country is a recently revived legacy of pre-soviet times, and many Kyrgyz people are embracing it under pressure from muslim men more and more women no longer go out to work, instead accepting to stay at home and be housewives.

In the video, the collapse of the Soviet Union is explained and mentioned is the rise of extremist organizations and the state needing to be more careful. Kyrgyzstan, a secular state, is mentioned as having a moderate form of Islam and mosques being full every Friday. There is a small farm operated by the imam, as well as a bakery and butcher shop that he receives donations from. There is also a Russian-language teacher, Dinara, who supports the new reform party because there are few truly democratic parties in Kyrgyzstan. Despite trials and sentences handed down, the real masterminds of the killing of journalist Anna Politkovskaya have not been identified. The principle of show strength and crush descent, which was used in the Soviet times, seems to work in Russia and is worrying because it recalls the power mechanisms of the past.
