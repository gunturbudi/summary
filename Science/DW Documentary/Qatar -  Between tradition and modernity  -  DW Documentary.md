DW Documentary's "Qatar: Between Tradition and Modernity" explores the multifaceted society of Qatar, highlighting the contrast between the traditional and the modern. The country's rapid development is enabled by its foreign workers, primarily from Nepal, India, Bangladesh, and the Philippines, but they often experience poor working conditions. The documentary also shows successful Qatari women such as Reem Al-Kuthairi who became the first Qatari woman to own her own aircraft and get a license to fly it. Additionally, the video depicts the country's traditional side through camel racing and Ramadan, while showcasing the modernization through impressive infrastructure projects such as a new subway. Despite these changes, Qatar remains progressive in its values, offering free education that particularly focuses on the advancement of girls.

In this section, a traditional aspect of Qatari culture, camel racing, is highlighted. The racing season is a major event and is highly prestigious, with even the Emir in attendance. The jockeys are small, remote-controlled robots to better accommodate the camels, and the prizes for the winners include an SUV or truck as well as a cash prize. The locals are deeply passionate about the sport, and the winning camel is greeted with traditional fanfare.

In this section, we see the contrast between traditional and modern Qatar, as two fans from Oman attend a traditional sporting event where it's a man's world, while in the modern capital of Doha, female drivers are commonplace. Reem Al-Kuthairi is an example of how Qatar combines both elements of its society, as she is the first Qatari woman to own her own aircraft and have a license to fly it, becoming a role model for women in the country. Despite facing challenges from her parents due to gender stereotypes, Reem has embraced the opportunities available and is an inspiration for other Qatari women to overcome their inhibitions and follow their dreams.

In this section, the video explores the contrasts in Qatar with its vision to become a modern monarchy, which is being made possible by the more than 2.2 million foreign workers primarily from Nepal, India, Bangladesh, and the Philippines. While some workers earn more than others like Yogendra Chhiteri, who earns 1300 riyal a month, most endure poor working conditions. Yogendra has worked as a security guard in Qatar for 19 years apart from his family. Despite the hardships, guest workers like him are making Qatar one of the richest nations globally. Meanwhile, powerful men like His Excellency Abdullah Al Attiyah enjoy a different lifestyle in Qatar, with a playground exclusively for their grandchildren.

In this section, we meet Abdullah, who became Qatar's energy minister in 1992 when the country had the world's largest gas field but could not export a single drop of liquid natural gas. With his efforts, Qatar is now the largest exporter of LNG, and he is proud of his achievements. Abdullah moves up the ranks to become the Emir's chief-of-staff, and even after getting surgery in Britain, he is amazed by the rapid development of the country. We also see Mohammed Shahin working in a traditional bazaar, preparing food in the heat, which is all in a day's work for him. The Beirut Restaurant is a family business that serves the best falafel in the country, and Ali, the son, follows his father's lead in cooking.

In this section, we see the Shahin family's restaurant, The Beirut, and how it has been passed down from generation to generation after the family fled Lebanon due to the civil war. The restaurant has become one of the oldest and beloved locations in Qatar that has served its customers for 60 years, while the Shahin family ensures that the quality of their ingredients and recipes are top-notch. Furthermore, we see Qatari women like Lolwa al-Marri, participating in an extreme sporting event in the desert, aiming to represent her country at the Olympics in the near future.

In this section, we see women in Qatar facing obstacles while participating in sports due to customs and traditions that involve women staying at home. However, Lolwa and others believe that sports are good for women's psyche and aim to prove that women have more stamina than men. Despite facing scorching desert conditions, Lolwa finished the race and hopes to carry the flag of Qatar at the Olympic Games to become a role model. Meanwhile, people like Mohammed Makki are cycling to work in pedestrian zones in Katara, a cultural village known for its planetarium and boutiques.

In this section, we see how Ramadan in Qatar is a time for everything - for the body, the soul and everything else. During this period, people come together and the stress of the year is vanquished. Although only about 65% of people in Qatar are Muslims, the country's diverse population consisting of people of different religions such as Christians and Hindus, come together during the month of Ramadan. During the day, the city seems empty, but as soon as the sun sets, life and people spring up from every corner. Ramadan is a spiritual month, a month of prayer and a time that families and friends come together.

In this section, the video depicts the stark contrast between the barren desert and flashy modernization of Qatar. The country has developed rapidly and continues to do so, with impressive infrastructure such as the new subway built in just two years. While Qatar may seem pristine, the country's transformation has had an impact in most places. Yet, the Qataris remain progressive in their values, providing advanced education free of charge, with a particular focus on the advancement of girls. One worker, Ibrahim al Bishri, expresses his immense gratitude for being allowed to work at the national library, emphasizing how it makes him feel proud.

Through his work, Ibrahim is able to share his love of books with others and contribute to making the library a special place for visitors.
