China's New Silk Road project, an investment in infrastructure in over 70 nations worldwide, has seen China take ownership of strategic ports such as Piraeus and show interest in Trieste, Italy. While critics warn that China's mega-project is a way for China to cement its power around the world and divide Europe, China sends soft power to Italy in the form of medical aid during the early stages of the pandemic, resulting in feelings of security and gratitude for the locals. The documentary explores the Chinese acquisition of Greece's most important port, Piraeus, and the impact it has had on the local workers. It also examines China's investments in Trieste, with the city investing in its rail network and port to become a major transshipment center for Chinese exports. Despite the economic benefits of Chinese investments, concerns about the possibility of a new Cold War and Europe's role in the trade war between China and the US cause uncertainty about the future of world trade.

In this section, we learn about China's New Silk Road project, where they invest in infrastructure in over 70 nations worldwide. Europe sees the Chinese as welcome investors, as they take ownership of strategic ports such as Piraeus and show interest in Trieste, Italy. While critics warn that China's mega-project is a way for them to cement their power around the world and divide Europe, China sends soft power to Italy in the form of medical aid during the early stages of the pandemic. This resulted in feelings of security and gratitude for the locals, as China presented itself as a savior in times of need.

In this section, the documentary explores the Chinese acquisition of Greece's most important port, Piraeus, and the impact it has had on the local workers. Since the Chinese investment, cargo handling at the port has increased tenfold, but the local dock workers have faced many challenges. They have protested the takeover, and since then, their work conditions have deteriorated, with a lack of stable employment and social protections. Piraeus is essential for China's New Silk Road project, as it serves as a transshipment hub for cargo vessels traveling from East Asia to Europe. However, the dockworkers remain skeptical about the supposed benefits for their community, questioning whether any new jobs will result from the increased trade.

In this section, Michele Geraci, the former Under Secretary of State in Italy’s Ministry of Economic Development, discusses his involvement in negotiating the Silk Road deal with China which is still valid. Geraci believes that this is the best economic opportunity for Italy to cooperate with China in doing business together to expand economic growth. He also hopes this cooperation will help the tourist industry to grow in Sicily through increased Chinese tourism. Meanwhile, sinologist and author Giada Messetti, who lived in China for six years, observed the development of the new Silk Road with a critical eye, considering it as an important political project with clearly defined economic benefits for China's interests, rather than an act of charity.

In this section, the focus is on Trieste, a key Italian port that holds great potential for Chinese investments in Europe. Francesco Parisi, a businessman whose family has been involved in transportation for almost 200 years, discusses the need to participate in international trading connected with logistics, particularly with China being the world's leading trading partner. However, the challenge is to strike the right balance as China's economic power can be overwhelming. Meanwhile, Petros Zhang, a Greek tour guide, talks about the importance of tourism as part of the New Silk Road, which has now taken a back seat because of the coronavirus pandemic.

In this section, the documentary discusses how the Greek government has been issuing "Golden Visas" to Chinese investors since 2013 to attract foreign investment, leading to the purchase of a vast amount of Greek real estate by Chinese buyers. Despite criticisms of the program for facilitating money laundering and corruption, many Chinese investors view this as an opportunity to secure a future in Europe for themselves and their families. However, the coronavirus pandemic has put a halt to the program, but estate agents believe that the lucrative market will recover after the pandemic.

In this section, the documentary discusses China's investments in the port of Piraeus, which started in 2008 and has since turned it into the biggest port in the Mediterranean, and they plan on investing 600 million euros more in the next few years to make it the biggest in Europe. Despite the Chinese commitment, some residents like Anastasia Frantzeskaki, a left-wing spokesperson who believes the old port area belongs to the city's residents, are skeptical of the investment's political consequences for Greece. She also worries about the EU's divisions over China, saying money makes countries dependent. However, Europe has yet to reach a consensus on how it wants to deal with China and what its attitude towards China is.

00:30:00
In this section, the documentary examines China's influence on Trieste, a port city on the Adriatic Sea that's hoping to return to its former status as a trading hub for Eastern Europe, with Chinese investments. Trieste is investing in its rail network and port to become a major transshipment center for Chinese exports. While welcoming Chinese investments, the city is at pains to emphasize that it has no intention of selling the port, lock, stock, and barrel. Despite the economic benefits of Chinese investments, some Italians, like Francesco Parisi, worry about the possibility of a new Cold War and the confrontational situation between the US and China, which puts his business at risk.

00:35:00
In this section, the debate about Europe's role in the trade war between China and the US is discussed. There are concerns that Europe risks becoming a battlefield between the two superpowers, and as such, politicians are pushing for stronger stands towards Beijing. However, it is noted that Europe needs to take a united approach towards China, rather than individual countries making agreements that may go against human rights violations. The dock workers union in Piraeus has already come to terms with its Chinese bosses, and the port will remain under Chinese control until 2052. Meanwhile, other investors are pushing ahead with the development of the Port of Trieste, but the Covid-19 pandemic is creating uncertainties about the future of world trade.

00:40:00
In this section, Michele Geraci, who helped engineer Italy's cooperation with the Belt and Road Initiative believes that Italy slowing down on its cooperation with China could have disastrous consequences for the country, causing it to fall back into the middle ages. China, in contrast, has planned, pre-programmed and pursued a political, economic project with Xi Jinping already thinking about 2049. The Chinese have immense economic power, and it is only natural for them to want to have a voice in the world and influence it.
