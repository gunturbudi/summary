The Renaissance was a time of great artistic and scientific achievement, with many famous artists and architects emerging during this period. However, the Renaissance was also a time of great upheaval, with the Protestant Reformation catalyzed by Martin Luther's rebellion against the Pope. The Renaissance left a legacy that can be seen in many aspects of modern life, from the invention of humanoids to the development of global trade.

Detail Summary:

The Renaissance was a time of great change, when people began to understand our planet in new ways and an empire arose. This was all thanks to the new portable timepieces, which allowed scholars to measure and calculate the paths of the heavenly bodies more accurately. Among the most famous figures of the Renaissance was Leonardo da Vinci, who is considered one of the most versatile geniuses of all time. He was also an architect, anatomist, sculptor, mathematician, iconoclast, and inventor. Some of his most famous paintings, such as the Mona Lisa, are still celebrated today. However, the negative effects of war on the Renaissance were significant, as huge sums of money were mobilized to the condottieri, the military contractors.

In the Renaissance, great minds searched for machines that could set the earth and the universe in motion, and clocks became the most mechanically elaborate devices of the era. One such mind was Leonardo da Vinci, whose designs for a gear train for a chariot and a tortoise-shaped siege vehicle were never implemented. However, his theoretical innovations led to advancements in technology, such as the clock.

In the 16th century, religious leaders like Martin Luther and John Calvin opposed the practice of charging interest, which was seen as a sin. However, the economy had come to play a different role in the Renaissance, and money had to be available in the economy. This led to the development of capitalism, which was spurred by the overall forces in society and by technical advancements.

This video discusses the Renaissance, which was a time in which thinkers began to challenge the church's worldview. Nicholas Copernicus, a canon at the Cathedral and a high-ranking government official, wrote a highly regarded work on the theory of money but his real passion was astronomy. His astronomical observations and calculations contradicted the generally accepted model originally posited by the ancient scholar Claudius Ptolemy. However, Copernicus was scared of publishing his theory, and his friends and confidants, including some high-ranking clerics, tried to persuade him to do so. It was only 70 years after his death that Galileo's observations provided convincing arguments. The earth was ultimately removed from the center of the universe and classified as an ordinary planet that orbited the Sun along with others. Copernicus saw how the apparent motion of the stars in the night sky was really the result of the Earth's own rotation. Everything orbited the Sun, so the actual center of the solar system had to be near it. His work had a great impact on our time, and without him, there would be no spaceflight or satellite communication systems. His calculations have had a real impact on us today.

The Renaissance was a time of great advances in maritime technology, including the development of the "instrument of navigation" known as the astrolabe. These advances led to the exploration and conquest of new territories, including the discovery of America. Artists, thinkers, and explorers also flourished during the Renaissance, contributing to the growth of human knowledge and understanding.

The video discusses the history of the Renaissance, which was a time of great change and innovation in the arts. Many important discoveries were made during the Renaissance, including the discovery of America and the invention of the printing press. However, the Renaissance also brought great disaster and destruction to the indigenous populations of Europe, as well as to the Spanish and Portuguese empires.

Jakob Fugger was a successful businessman and Christian who also built a social housing project for the poor in his hometown of Augsburg, Germany. He was a tough and efficient manager, but he was also repentant and built an estate for the poor.

During the Renaissance, Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci were two of the most famous and influential artists of their time. Michelangelo was asked to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, and Leonardo designed the Mona Lisa. Julius II, the pope who commissioned these works, was a powerful and modern ruler who helped to expand Rome and bring about the Renaissance. However, the Renaissance popes were also known for their immoral behavior, which led to the Protestant Reformation. Without the Renaissance popes, much of the art, architecture, and music of the time would not have been created.

The Renaissance was a time of great artistic and scientific achievement, with Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and Bramante among the most famous artists and architects. Michelangelo's masterpiece, the Sistine Chapel, was funded by the sale of indulgences, and the Reformation, which followed Luther's rebellion against the Pope, was catalyzed by his writings.

The Renaissance was a time of great change and development, and its legacy can be seen in many aspects of modern life. Among the most significant inventions during the Renaissance were humanoids (such as Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa"), machines that are precursors of a future in which robots play football, and the development of global transport and trade. The Renaissance also gave rise to intellectuals who were curious and daring, and who challenged accepted wisdom.
