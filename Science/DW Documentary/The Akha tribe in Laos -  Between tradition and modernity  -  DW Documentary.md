Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
In this section, we are introduced to a family in a remote Akha village in Laos, who are trying to balance their traditional way of life with modernity, as they make small steps towards a wider world. The family lives as subsistence farmers, growing their food and raising animals, but they also occasionally sell a pig for extra income, which helps support the youngest son, who left the village to attend school in a nearby town. The women of the family fetch wood and spin cotton, and the youngest son is the family's hope for a better, easier life for the younger generation. The wife of the youngest son undergoes a lot of household chores despite having a husband, who does not seem to help much.

In this section, we see the daily life in the Lauvin family, members of the Akha ethnic tribe in Laos. The family practices a traditional lifestyle, including eating three meals a day consisting of mostly vegetables and rice. Much of their daily routines and festivals are governed by traditions passed down through generations, including the shaman who is also a member of the village council of elders. The shaman is called to prevent evil spirits from taking the soul of a sick child by creating a doll made of paper, gold, tobacco, and rice to lure them away.

In this section of the video, we see the Akha tribe's shaman performing a ritual to banish evil spirits that are causing a child to have a fever. The shaman sacrifices a chicken and puts the evil spirits inside a paper doll before removing it from the village with a sword to ensure they remain banished. The Akha people have maintained their traditional way of life for centuries and believe that cutting the sacred trees will lead to sickness and harm to the village. Despite serving in the military, Pao Kyung remains committed to his Akha traditions, and after the harvest, the tribe works together to dry the rice under the sun every day.

In this section, the traditional dress and customs of the Akha tribe in Laos are explored. Women move to their husband's village and begin adding to the decoration of their traditional dress. The Akha people have strict rules about forbidden days and have highly skilled production of textiles. Each family in the village produces their own clothing, and the fabrics have to be hung to dry for over 12 months before they can be made into clothing. The tribe also has strict rules about marriage, including an embarrassement towards PDA, and separation of husbands and wives sleeping arrangements.

In this section, we see the Akha tribe in Laos working on their rice fields, clearing new land for planting when the old soil became depleted. They hunt for wild animals on longer missions; however, one brother-in-law was accidentally shot. When the rice plants have grown, the tribe conducts a sacrifice to the spirits, where four chickens are slaughtered for feeding the spirits and animals around the field. The family's youngest son brought with him some clothes given by the people of Phongsali.

In this section, we see the Akha tribe's struggle between holding onto their traditions and embracing modernity. While some believe in continuing their culture, others see the benefits of moving down the mountainside for better access to medical and government services. The village chief wants to relocate, but not all families want to move as they fear losing touch with their culture. The dilemma highlights the challenges of adapting to a changing world while preserving one's identity and traditions.

00:30:00
In this section, the video explores the strict cultural traditions of the Akha tribe in Laos, including the taboo surrounding twins. If a woman gives birth to twins, the family cannot stay in the village and must build a small hut in the forest, where they are not allowed any contact or communication with the rest of the tribe. They are only allowed to return to the village after killing the newborn twins, and their home is burned down with everything it contains. The Akha people believe that only animals can give birth to more than one baby at a time and consider the birth of twins to be the work of an evil spirit.

00:35:00
In this section, the documentary follows the funeral ceremony of the Akha people, during which animal sacrifices are made based on the prosperity of the deceased. The shaman plays a crucial role in the ritual and must kill a water buffalo with a single spear stab. Afterward, the head of the buffalo is brought noisily to the roof to ensure the family's continued prosperity. Additionally, the length and size of the funeral ceremony are determined based on the prosperity of the deceased, and the ceremony can last longer and involve more animal sacrifices for wealthier individuals. Later in the video, the story shifts to Kianglum, a young Akha man who aspires to attend university and become a police officer, although his father is not supportive of these plans, and his financial situation is uncertain.

00:40:00
In this section, we see Kianglum, a member of the Akha tribe in Laos, who has spent the last seven years living away from his village and its customs. He is determined to earn a living, and while he acknowledges that this means leaving behind the traditions of his people, he sees it as a way of fulfilling his father's hopes. Despite the challenges of life in town, he believes it is easier than life in the village above the clouds.
