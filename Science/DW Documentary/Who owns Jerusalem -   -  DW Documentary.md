The DW Documentary "Who owns Jerusalem?" delves into the various perspectives on Jerusalemâ€™s status as a shared city by Israelis, Palestinians and others. The documentary explores the historical and cultural significance of the city for both Israelis and Palestinians, discussing the tensions and clashes caused by differing claims of sovereignty. While some Jewish residents of Jerusalem find it a peaceful and diverse city with the different ideologies coexisting, Palestinian residents complain about exclusion, mistrust, and harassment. Despite these tensions, the video also showcases positive examples of coexistence through six Israeli schools that promote open dialogue and understanding between Jewish and Muslim students.

In this section, the focus is on the reactions of Israelis and Palestinians to Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Israelis like Hakan and Shmuel believe that Jerusalem has always been their capital, and Trump's decision is just an acknowledgement of that fact. However, Palestinians like anthropologist Anacleto consider Jerusalem to be their historical home and feel cheated out of their rightful heritage by the decision. Despite the tensions and protests, most people in Jerusalem want things to stay harmonious and peaceful, especially in the Temple Mount area where holy sites for Judaism and Islam are crowded side-by-side.

In this section, the documentary explores the competing claims to sovereignty over Jerusalem. Father Nicodemus Schnabel of the Dormition Abbey believes that Israelis and Palestinians both have equal claims to the Holy Land and that a two-state solution is the path forward. However, Israeli demands for more security have fueled the building of the wall, which has tampered with the demography of Jerusalem. The recent American policy change regarding Jerusalem has also raised concerns about exacerbating the situation for Palestinians. Journalist Sarah Ceremony at ski has her doubts about a peace dialogue, as she has found that many people in the region do not want to share Jerusalem or Israel.

In this section, the documentary explores the idea of a Jewish state and how it has provided a safe haven for Jews throughout the world who have faced increasing persecution and anti-Semitism. However, this idea of a Jewish state has also led to conflict and an ongoing struggle for Palestinians living in East Jerusalem, who feel separated and excluded from their Jewish counterparts. Despite this divide, there are still those who believe in peaceful coexistence and are tired of the violence and aggression on both sides.

In this section, the video shows the separation between Israelis and Palestinians, with a whole generation of young people growing up in Bethlehem or Jericho with no chance to visit Jerusalem. While Palestinian Mohammed believes that Israelis don't want to change anything and only when they become desperate and have nothing to lose will they go crazy, Israeli tour guide Shmoocon disagrees, saying that he has good relationships with Muslim hotel staff and drivers in Jerusalem and Israel. However, Palestinians complain about being mistrusted as a group and subject to searches and harassment. Meanwhile, Jerusalem's Arab residents, like Ali Jabber, are concerned about more houses falling into Israeli hands, and they fear that their fundamentalist collaborators will come and cause problems leading to more political statements.

In this section, we hear from both a Palestinian resident and a Jewish resident of Jerusalem, each with their own perspective on the tensions and daily life in the city. While the Palestinian resident feels it's increasingly impossible to survive there and worries for his daughter's future, the Jewish resident sees the peaceful coexistence of the different religions and ideologies in one place. Meanwhile, a musician in East Jerusalem advocates for a focus on togetherness and reconciliation rather than anger and division, believing that collaboration and communication with Israelis is the key to finding a solution.

In this section, we learn about six schools in Israel where Jews and Muslims study together, and teaching is in both Arabic and Hebrew. The schools aim to acknowledge differences and encourage open dialogue between students to promote understanding and acceptance of one another. While Israelis and Palestinians may not agree on Jerusalem's status, there are positive examples of coexistence that can foster a shared future, despite ideological differences. These schools demonstrate that people can live together regardless of their differences, and the model has been successful over the last 20 years.
