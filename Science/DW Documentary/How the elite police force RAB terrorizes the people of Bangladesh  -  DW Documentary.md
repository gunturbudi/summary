The elite police force RAB in Bangladesh is accused of being a "death squad" responsible for human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings and torture. The force, created with support from the US and British governments after 9/11, operates unchecked despite accusations against it. The documentary details firsthand accounts of victims and insiders of RAB, providing evidence of their systematic crimes, including staged shootouts and executions. Although families of those taken by RAB are pressuring the government to act, the government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, has been unwilling to acknowledge the problem. Despite sanctions imposed by the US on RAB officials, impunity remains pervasive in Bangladesh's law enforcement. The video calls for the identification and sanctioning of all responsible parties and ultimately argues that there should not be any type of organization like RAB in Bangladesh.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
In this section, we see the investigation by DW and Netra News into the accusations against the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), a special unit of the Bangladesh police. The investigative team interviewed victims and insiders of RAB and discovered that the unit is a "death squad," responsible for a number of human rights violations. RAB was created in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, with support from the US and British governments. Despite accusations of extrajudicial killings and torture, RAB continues to operate practically unchecked, with the Ministry of Home Affairs denying allegations against it.

In this section, we hear an excerpt from a phone call between a man and his wife, recorded moments before he was executed by the Bangladesh elite police force, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB). The call offers direct evidence of how extrajudicial killings are staged by the RAB and were one of the events covered by two whistleblowers who spoke out about the systematic human rights abuses committed by the RAB. The whistleblowers provided insight into the nature of RAB operations to monitor and ultimately kill their victims, often using civilian vans with tinted windows, soft cloths or towels to avoid leaving marks on the body and pulling the trigger from one or two feet away.

In this section of the video, it is shown that the elite police force RAB takes great care to ensure that their crimes leave no implicating traces. However, their procedures are so systematic that they create distinct patterns that reveal RAB's involvement. They have specific execution sites where most victims are left to bleed to death, and rewards await the performers when operations are successful. The post-mortem reports and data of reported shootouts compiled by activists paint a bleak portrayal of RAB's crimes. The question is asked as to why nobody is putting a stop to it, including all of Bangladesh's governments in power during the existence of RAB.

In this section, the documentary highlights the government's reluctance to investigate the allegations of human rights violations within the RAB, as Sheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, has been unwilling to acknowledge the problem. Under her rule, RAB has been accused of staged shootouts, abductions, and torture. Families of those taken by RAB are pressuring the government to act, but they too face harassment and intimidation from law enforcement agencies. The Ministry of Home Affairs dismissed the allegations of political involvement as "malafide."

In this section, the documentary details the story of Nafiz Mohammed Alam, who was arrested by the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), an elite police force in Bangladesh accused of extrajudicial killings and torture, for allegedly illegally selling alcohol. Alam recounts the horrors he experienced during his 36-hour torture inside a well-organized and managed torture room, where he was beaten and given electric shocks by RAB's torturer, Major Naveed Kaiser. Despite facing charges and imprisonment, Alam felt some hope when the US imposed sanctions on RAB officials, including Kaiser, for their gross violation of human rights, particularly the extrajudicial killing of a journalist. However, impunity remains pervasive in Bangladesh's law enforcement, particularly for those who have yet to be named and targeted by sanctions.

In this section, the video discusses how despite the sanctions imposed on RAB and the decrease in the number of killings, the elite police force is still committing crimes and could become even more dangerous during the upcoming general elections. The force was initially created to fight terrorism but is now terrorizing many in Bangladesh, and evidence suggests that it is being used as a political tool. The video calls for the identification and sanctioning of all responsible parties for RAB's crimes, even if it means targeting the highest level of the state. Ultimately, the video argues that there should not be any type of organization like RAB in Bangladesh.
