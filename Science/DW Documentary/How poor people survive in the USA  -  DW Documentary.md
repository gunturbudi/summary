The video discusses the stark contrasts between California and Virginia, where a growing number of workers can no longer afford to live. In Virginia, evictions are a routine job for officers loyal from the sheriff's office. The threatened tenants have one week to settle their debts or face eviction by force. The tenant is not currently at home and clearly they've not had time to vacate the premises, so the landlord immediately reclaims his property.
