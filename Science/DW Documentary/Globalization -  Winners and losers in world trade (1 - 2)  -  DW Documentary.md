The video discusses the negative effects of globalization on certain parts of the world, such as Duisburg, Germany, which lost many jobs due to Chinese trade. Today, Duisport is the largest inland port in Germany and relies on the "just in time" principle, which has benefited the city greatly. However, the video also discusses the problems with globalization in other parts of the world, such as Piraeus, Greece, and Hambantota, Sri Lanka, where ports have been taken over by Chinese operators due to excessive debt.

This video discusses the impact of globalization on the steel industry in the United States. With global competition from countries such as China, the steel industry is facing a lot of challenges. Duisburg, a German port town, is one example of a town that has successfully adapted to globalization by forging alliances and staying flexible. However, American steelworkers are feeling cheated by globalization because they no longer have the same control over their industry as they used to.

In this video, economist Hernando de Soto discusses the effects of globalization on countries around the world. He states that although Peru may appear to be at the end of the "worst of all developing countries," in reality, the situation is probably even worse. Since 2016, Peru has had four presidents, and the system has collapsed, leading to high Covid-19 death rates and an "informal economy" that has taken over. Industrial fishing is on a break, and the anchovies that are a major source of income for the town of Chancay are being exported to China, which is poised to take over Peru's fish resources.

Globalization has created winners and losers in world trade, with the coastal Peruvian town of Chancay divided over the proposed construction of a new port. The Chinese fishing fleet is rapidly expanding in the region, threatening local fisheries and exacerbating poverty and inequality. Peru is struggling to profit from globalization, and the microloans that were supposed to help the poor have had little success in stemming the flow of migrants to Lima.

In this video, DW interviews several people in different parts of the world who have benefitted from globalization, such as Marleny Aparicio, who started her own small factory after 12 years of looking, and Gloria, who has given up fish farming due to the polluted waters of Lake Titicaca. However, there are also many people who have been negatively affected, such as Julio Solis, who died from the pandemic in 2020, and her father, who lost his life to the virus. The video also documents the success of a microcredit program offered by Pro Mujer, which has helped many fisherwomen in Peru improve their lives.

The video discusses the pros and cons of globalization, and argues that while it can be a good thing, it is often the division of labor and the bringing together of humanity that are the real winners. It suggests that we should invest in global cooperation, rather than withdraw into ourselves.
