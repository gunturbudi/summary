This video looks at the work of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in Africa, and how some activists are concerned about the potential risks of genetically modified mosquitoes spreading malaria in the area. The head of PR for the project denies any risks, but the documentary raises doubts about the project.

Detail Summary:

This video focuses on the controversy surrounding GMOs in Uganda, where Western interests are funding a genetically modified corn plantation. The director of the plantation talks to security about the journalists, who are then told to leave. Social media shows a different tone, with many commenters praising the GMOs for fighting hunger in Africa.

In this documentary, researchers look at the role of philanthropy in Africa, and how some wealthy individuals are using this to promote GMOs. They also look at the work of an activist in Ivory Coast, Darlène Kassem, and discuss the potential for GMO crops in Africa. Despite being largely unknown, GMO crops are growing in popularity on the continent.

Activists in Africa are concerned about the threat posed to traditional African agriculture by genetically modified crops, and Western donors have been promoting this technology in return for investments in agriculture. Gates has taken on an urgent problem of eradicating diseases that affect the African cassava, which he calls "the most interesting vegetable in the world." However, his approach is problematic because it relies on technological miracles and ignores other factors that may be important in eradicating diseases, such as environmental degradation.

The lab in this video is researching ways to prevent Cassava plants from being infected by viruses. The lab also has an Instagram account which features pictures of the lab's scientists working in Africa. The topic of GMOs and genetic enhancements arises and the professor seems uncomfortable with the topic. CRISPR is a new method of gene manipulation which has recently gained attention. There are two types of genome editing - genetic scissors and gene silencing. The professor explains that genetic editing does not involve the transfer of genes from one organism to another, but rather modifications to the genetic material of the plant without the need for a transplant.

The "Law for Development and International Solidarity" (2014) forbids the European Union from financing research on GMOs in Africa, but they have done so anyway. The European Commission replied by email that there was no laboratory in Ivory Coast working on transgenic plants or animals, but they have purchased equipment with EU funds. The Gates Foundation has provided $15 million for the research programme.

Bill Gates promotes genetic engineering in order to fight malaria, and his foundation has a stake in a company that sells genetically modified seeds. Gates is also involved in other areas such as promoting electric grids in Africa. The government is having a hard time saying no to Gates' plans, and his donations could have a profound impact on countries in Africa.

00:30:00
The Gates Foundation is funding a project to modify mosquitoes so that they don't transmit malaria. The project has already taken place in a field trial in West Africa, but the Gates Foundation is worried about its results.

00:35:00
The target of this documentary is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has been pouring billions of dollars into Burkina Faso, Africa, in an effort to improve the lives of those in greatest need. However, some activists are concerned about the potential risks of genetically modified mosquitoes spreading malaria in the area. The head of PR for the project, Mr. Méda, denies any risks, but admits that he does not know how the transfer of the genetically modified genetic material turned out. This raises further doubts about the project. In addition, the documentary looks at the work of the Institute of Population Science, which is funded by the Gates Foundation. This foundation is also behind a number of "transformative techniques" that are protected by the financial power of the Gates Foundation. The United Nations has been powerless to stop the Gates Foundation's ambitions.

00:40:00
The Gates Foundation paid $1.6 million to a lobbying agency in order to convince a group of UN scientists to endorse "gene drive," or the genetic engineering of mosquitoes. The lobbying agency was successful, and the decision text on gene drive does not include a moratorium or ban. This is a positive result for us. Bill Gates has yet to answer any of our questions about the decision.
