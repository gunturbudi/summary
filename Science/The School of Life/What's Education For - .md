# Summary of What's Education For?

The video titled "What's Education For?" argues that the real purpose of education is to equip individuals for the challenges of adult life, yet schools fail to achieve this objective. The solution is not to spend more money, but to introduce an updated curriculum that is more ambitious and prepares students to work and maintain healthy relationships. Self-knowledge, kindness, forgiveness, and anxiety-reduction techniques are just some examples of the type of education needed to prepare individuals for life instead of just children. The video suggests that the real source of education's problems is the curriculum, not issues like money, salaries, or discipline.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
In this section, it is asserted that the real purpose of education is to equip us for the challenges of adult life, and yet schools fail to prepare their students for this purpose, reflecting pervasive and widespread trouble dealing with life's challenges among almost all students. Education can get more ambitious without necessitating additional spending, instead focusing on the two fundamental tasks of working and maintaining good relationships. A new curriculum could emphasise two subjects by demystifying capitalism and teaching self-knowledge, delving into concepts of delusion, defensiveness, projection, and denial. Schools would explore career self-knowledge and devote time to relationships through units on kindness, forgiveness, and anxiety-reduction techniques. Education should be for life, not just for children, with media and the arts used to help teach useful skills, as the real source of education's problems is the wrong curriculum, not money, salaries, or discipline.
