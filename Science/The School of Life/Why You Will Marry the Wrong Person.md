The speaker provides advice on how to deal with anger and sadness after a failed relationship. He contends that all humans are "very strange" and that many of us are addicts in the sense that we need to redefine what is wrong with us.

The author of the video discusses addiction and how it can be defined in many ways. He states that addiction is any pattern of behavior whereby a person cannot stand to be alone and are compelled to seek out company. He goes on to say that love is one of the most difficult things for humans to do, as it requires us to approach another person and be vulnerable. The author offers two psychological patterns that people tend to exhibit when in need of love: anxiously attached or avoidant. The former is when a person becomes overly attached to someone and does not allow for freedom and trust; the latter is when a person does not want to be vulnerable and does not trust the other person. The author says that love is ultimately personal and a willingness to interpret another person's behavior. He argues that most of us are not used to this type of love and often make mistakes in our relationships because of it.
