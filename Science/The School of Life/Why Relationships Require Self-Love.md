In this section of the video, it is explained that having a certain level of self-love is essential to being able to have functional and healthy relationships. Without a decent amount of self-love, love from another person can feel misguided and sickening, causing one to self-destructively reject it. Moreover, it is normal to reject the love of another person if we hate ourselves, making it important to extend compassion to ourselves and counteract the unduly harsh ideas absorbed in childhood by imagining how a compassionate figure would have treated us in the past. In conclusion, the goal is to achieve a sane, fair, and more accurate perspective on our nature, by accepting that being silly, making mistakes, and having average sexuality is normal.
