Karl Marx argued that capitalism, which rewards people for putting economic interests first, creates an "ideology" that teaches people to be anxious, competitive, conformist, and politically complacent. He believed that communism, a society where people are freed from economic constraint, would allow people to develop all sorts of sides of their natures. After Marx moved to London, his friend and intellectual partner Friedrich Engels covered his debts and made sure his works were published. Capitalism paid for Communism. Marx was not a well-regarded or popular intellectual in his day, but his ideas later helped to create some of the most important ideological movements of the 20th century.
