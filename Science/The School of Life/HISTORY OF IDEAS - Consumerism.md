The history of ideas discusses how consumerism is important to the economy and how it needs to be reformed. It explains how the consumer revolution in Britain led to other countries following suit and how some people disagreed with the changes. Adam Smith argued that consumerism can be helpful for the poor, as it provides employment based around satisfying what are often rather sub-optimal purchases.

Detail Summary:

The early 18th century saw a remarkable change in the economy, with countries becoming wealthier and wages rising. This came about due to a consumer revolution in Britain, led by philosopher and economist Bernard Mandeville. Other countries followed suit, and the era is now known as the "world's first consumer revolution." However, there were some who disagreed with the changes, and argued that high levels of consumption were bad for the nation and the spiritual life of the people.

In the 17th century, Adam Smith wrote a book called "The Wealth of Nations" in which he argued that consumerism can be helpful for the poor, as it provides employment based around satisfying what are often rather sub-optimal purchases. Smith was as ready as other economists to mock the triviality of some consumer choices while admiring their consequences all those embroidered lace handkerchiefs, dual snuff boxes, and miniature temples made of cream for dessert. He conceded but he believed they encouraged trade, created employment, and generated immense wealth. He had seen the expansion of the Edinburgh book trade and knew how large a market higher education might become. He understood how much wealth was being accumulated through the construction of Edinburgh's extremely handsome and noble newtown. He also saw that humans have many higher needs that require a lot of labor and intelligence and work to fulfill, but that lie outside of capitalist enterprise as conceived of by realists like Bernard Mandeville. While the capitalism of our times still hasn't entirely come round to resolving the awkward choices that Mandeville and Rousseau circled, the crucial hope for the future is that we may not forever need to be making money off rather exploitative, silly, or vain consumer appetites.
