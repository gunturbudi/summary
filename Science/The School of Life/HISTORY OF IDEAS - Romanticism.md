The History of Ideas explores Romanticism, a movement that emerged in the mid-18th century in response to industrialization, urbanization, secularization, and consumerism. Romanticism celebrates nature and depicts industrialization as the enemy of the natural world. The movement highlights the grandeur of nature through literature, art, and architecture. The romantic hero is often an artist rejected by a cruel, vulgar world, and the movement borrows from Christianity, with the secularized Christ-like figure being a prevalent theme. Romanticism stands for the irrational, untrained, and childlike and has stood the test of time.

In this section, we learn that Romanticism started in the mid-18th century in Western Europe and subsequently spread all over the world. It was a reaction to the growing industrialization, urbanization, secularization, and consumerism in the modern world. The central moments in the history of Romanticism have been highlighted, including the rise of the child, who represents natural goodness, spontaneity, and wisdom, as advocated by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his book "Emile" or "On Education," and the idea of the sensitive, doomed person who is often an artist rejected by a cruel, vulgar world, as exemplified by Thomas Chatterton - the poet who ended his life at 17 because no one wanted to publish his poetry. Romanticism also borrows from Christianity, with the romantic hero being a secularized Christ-like figure, which is evident in the story of Werther - the protagonist in Goethe's "The Sorrows of Young Werther" - who is passionate and entirely impractical.

In this section, the History of Ideas explains the Romantic movement, which is the act of taking the side of nature against industry, industry being known as the enemy of the natural world. It celebrates the beauty of the natural environment and the simple life. The section incorporates various examples of the Romantic movement, including William Wordsworth writing about appreciating natural elements. Thomas Cole's paintings emphasize the grandeur of nature by highlighting the power of landscapes such as the Niagara Falls, which transcend all human achievement and concerns. Augustus Pugin's Gothic architectural designs mimic pre-industrialized times when there was no obsession with technology or money. Charles Baudelaire celebrates the fl√¢neur, an idle loafer observing the busy streets of city life, reflecting a rejection of practicality and appreciation for playfulness. Paul Gauguin searches for a life away from artificiality and convention in the South Pacific, where he sees that civilization has made people sick. At its core, Romanticism has stood up for the irrational, untrained, exotic, childlike, and naive.
