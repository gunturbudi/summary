David Hume is one of the world's great philosophical voices because he hit upon the key fact that we are more influenced by our feelings than by reason. This is, at one level, possibly a great insult to our self image, but Hume thought that if we could learn to deal well with this surprising fact, we could be both individually and collectively a great deal calmer and happier than if we denied it. His later works - popular history books and collections of elegant essays - were best-sellers of the day.
