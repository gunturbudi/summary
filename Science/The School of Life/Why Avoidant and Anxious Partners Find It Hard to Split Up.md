In this section, the video discusses a pattern that often emerges in relationships between those who are anxiously attached and those who are avoidantly attached. The anxiously attached party tends to feel increasingly frustrated with their partner's perceived emotional distance, while the avoidantly attached partner may feel that their partner is too demanding. This cycle eventually leads the anxious partner to break things off, causing the avoidant partner to undergo a sudden and dramatic change in personality. However, the problems inevitably return, leading to more arguments and crisis. The video suggests that the couple can break free from this cycle by becoming aware of their patterns, learning about attachment theory, and refusing to play their unconscious games any longer.
