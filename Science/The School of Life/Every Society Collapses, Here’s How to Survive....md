The video is a summary of Edward Gibbon's "The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire." Gibbon covers 1000 years of decline, starting in the early 18th century and finishing in 1787. The work is an account of disasters that keep happening on the surface, with reform plans failing and key institutions becoming corrupt. The decline ultimately ends with the fall of Constantinople in 1453. The main beneficiaries of the empire's demise were Venice and the west, which benefited from the influx of scholars and the rise of the Renaissance.
