This video discusses how to be charming when talking about oneself. Polite people are taught from an early age not to talk too much about themselves, but this rule fails to differentiate between different types of self-promotion. There are as well mannered people who sometimes forget better ways to share details of their lives. Self-absorption is a problem, but there is one particular way of discussing oneself that never fails to win friends and reassure audiences. This video also discusses how to be charming when talking about one's sex life, career, family, and other problems. It is important to remember that by revealing these wounds, others could laugh or social media could have a field day. However, friendship is the dividend of gratitude that flows from an acknowledgment that talking is something valuable and something that can build self-esteem and dignity.
