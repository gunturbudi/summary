The Hierarchy of Needs theory is a seminal idea in psychology that was first introduced in 1943 by Abraham Maslow. It is a pyramid shaped diagram that ranks five needs from the most basic to the most important. Maslow believed that psychology could help us answer the yearnings and questions that people had once taken to religion. He hoped that businesses could learn to fulfill the essential spiritual appetites of the people, in order to create a well-lived life. The Hierarchy of Needs can be used to help assess the direction of a person's life, and can be used to make wiser decisions in work, love, and the rest of one's life.

The Hierarchy of Needs theory is a seminal idea in psychology that was first introduced in 1943. It is a pyramid shaped diagram that ranks five needs from the most basic to the most important. The five needs are physiological needs (food, water, warmth, and rest), safety needs (bodily security, protection from attack), belongingness needs (friends and family, esteem and respect), and self-actualization needs (living according to one's full potential, becoming who you really are). Abraham Maslow believed that psychology could help us answer the yearnings and questions that people had once taken to religion. He saw the hierarchy of needs as a way to capture a profound structural truth about human existence. Maslow was highly critical of businesses for their focus on meeting customers' needs at the bottom of the pyramid, while neglecting the needs of the people at the summit of the pyramid. He hoped that businesses could learn to fulfill the essential spiritual appetites of the people, in order to create a well-lived life.
