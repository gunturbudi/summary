This video discusses psychologist Sewell Rosen's studies on projections and how our past influences our present. Rosen found that some people inherit a strong emotional legacy, while others might be more resilient when faced with bad news or humiliation. The video also discusses Rosen's projective test, which asks participants to say the first thing that comes to mind when completing a sentence. Some people inherit a legacy of difficult childhood experiences, while others may be more prone to projecting their emotions onto others. Finally, the video discusses Rosen's research on men and authority, which shows that women are more likely to project their feelings onto men in positions of authority.

The video discusses how our past influences our present, specifically with regards to how we react to events and feel emotionally. One example discussed is how someone might feel scared based off of what is in front of them, even though there is nothing actually scary around them. Another example is how someone might feel harshly judged by a person they are speaking to, even though the person is actually trying to help. Psychologists have developed tests to help identify projection, which is when we project our thoughts, feelings, or expectations from the past onto the present.
