In this section, Goethe's life and lessons are explored, starting with the limitations of romantic love portrayed in his novel "The Sorrows of Young Werther". He believed that the core problem with romantic love is that it hopes to freeze a beautiful moment, and real love is always a terrible disappointment in comparison. This led him to abandon some of the heady hopes of the early days for the sake of tranquility and administrative competence. Goethe's second lesson was to get a real job to help put big ideas into practice, despite art and literature often being viewed as at odds with government administration. Finally, Goethe viewed travel as therapy and spent time in Rome to support an inner journey towards maturity.

In this section, we learn that for Goethe, the essence of travel was in finding a missing ingredient of personal growth. His most famous work, Faust, explores the idea of living life to the fullest and avoiding the pitfalls that come with power, knowledge, and sexuality. Goethe viewed science as a means to exploring our relationship with the natural world and emphasized its psychological impact, focusing on what we see and its personal significance. He was concerned that the professionalization of science by people like Isaac Newton would lead to a loss of personal meaning in science, and thus, found joy in science that individuals could research and experience personally.
