Adam Smith's theory of free trade, known as "capitalism," convinced most of the economic and political classes of North Western Europe that it was the best way to grow wealthy. Protectionism, which was the prevailing theory at the time, was based on the belief that a country should make as many things as possible within its own borders, reduce reliance on foreign imports, and rely on its strengths in specific areas. The debate between free trade and protectionism came to a head in the early 1800s with the publication of Adam Smith's book, "An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations." After bitter debates in Parliament, the Corn Laws, which were protectionist measures against cheap foreign grain, were repealed. This event demonstrated the advantages and incidental costs of free trade. Large swathes of British agriculture went to the wall as cheap imported corn from Canada and the United States destroyed farms.
