John Rawls is a twentieth-century American philosopher known for his book, A Theory of Justice, which aimed to show people how their societies were unfair and what they could do about it. Rawls's greatest thought experiment, the "veil of ignorance," is a tool to scrutinize current societies based on a simple experiment. The transcript suggests that Rawls recognized that the experiment presents different issues in different contexts, but critics can use it to determine whether a society is fair. Rawls believes that society is at a point where we know what needs to be fixed; we just haven't focused on it properly until now. However, achieving a just society is a significant challenge that we cannot sanely take on right now.

In this section, we learn about John Rawls, a twentieth-century American philosopher, who provides a model for identifying what might be unfair and how to gather support for fixing things. Rawls originally became inspired to become an academic to change the unjust world he was living in, and it was the publication of his book, A Theory of Justice, in 1971 that made his name. Rawls believed that current societies are patently unfair and that debates about unfairness often get bogged down in details and petty squabbling, so he sought a simple, economical, and polemical way to show people how their societies were unfair and what they might do about it. Rawls devised one of the greatest thought experiments in the history of political thought called the "veil of ignorance," which forces observers to accept the sort of society they would want to live in if their future life chances were not known beforehand. Rawls believes society is at a point where we know what needs to be fixed; we just haven't focused on it properly until now.

In this section, the transcript suggests that Rawlsâ€™s experiment provides us with a tool to scrutinize our current societies based on a simple experiment. It states that Rawls recognized that the veil of ignorance experiment presents different issues in different contexts, pointing out that each context's priority varies. However, critics can use this experiment to determine whether a society is fair by examining their level of imaginary ignorance. Rawls's experiment provides an objective view of what a fair society's details look like and suggests that we still have a long way to go in achieving a just society, as we cannot sanely take on such a challenge right now.
