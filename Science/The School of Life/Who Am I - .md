The video discusses the philosophical concept of personal identity, which is far more complicated than initially assumed. It argues that personal identity is not simply located in our body, but in our character or personality. This means that even if our body were to disappear, we would still be ourselves.

John Locke argues that personal identity is made up of "sameness of consciousness." If a demon offered us a choice between remembering everything but feeling and valuing very differently, or feeling and valuing the same sorts of things but remembering nothing, most of us would choose the latter. Death is sad, according to the standard view, because it means the end of our identity. However, if we focus on questions of identity, such as values and inclinations, we are granted a kind of immortality.
