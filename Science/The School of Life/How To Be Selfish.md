The video discusses the difference between good and bad selfishness, and how we often fail to be clear about our needs because we are confused about this distinction. The video suggests that we persuasively and kindly convey to those around us that we're not lazy or callous, but that we will simply better serve their needs by not doing the expected things for a while.

The video discusses the difference between good and bad selfishness. The good kind of selfishness involves having the courage and self-awareness to give priority to oneself at particular points, the confidence to be forthright about one's needs--not in order to harm or reject other people, but in order to serve them in a deeper, more sustained and committed way. Bad selfishness, on the other hand, operates with no greater end in view, and no higher motive in mind. The video discusses how afflicted by confusion about this distinction, we frequently fail to be brave enough about stating our needs as clearly as we should, with disastrous results precisely for those we're meant to serve. To become a better ambassador of one's intentions, the video suggests that we persuasively and kindly convey to those around us that we're not lazy or callous (and indeed, we're not), but that we will simply better serve their needs by not doing the expected things for a while.
