Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=HZoUlMrWuCU

The video explores the tragic story of Oscar Wilde and his downfall from being a successful playwright to his imprisonment for engaging in homosexual relationships, which was considered a crime in his time. Wilde's relationship with Lord Alfred Douglas, son of the Marquess of Queensberry, resulted in a public battle and eventually a trial where it was revealed that Wilde had hired male prostitutes. He was sentenced to two years of hard labor, which left him physically and mentally broken. Wilde's life after his release was characterized by poverty, drinking, and isolation, and he eventually died at the age of 46. While society has become more accepting of homosexuality, the video calls for extending understanding and compassion to all those who face difficulties due to societal judgment and condemnation.

In this section, we learn of the rise and fall of Oscar Wilde, from the success of his comedic plays to his imprisonment for engaging in homosexual relations. Wilde's downfall began when he met Lord Alfred Douglas, with whom he fell in love, despite being married with children. When Douglas's father, the Marquess of Queensberry, found out about their relationship, he began to harass Wilde publicly, which led to Wilde suing him for libel. However, during the trial, it was revealed that both Wilde and Douglas had hired male prostitutes, which ultimately led to Wilde's arrest on charges of gross indecency. He was sentenced to two years of hard labor, which left him physically and mentally broken. Wilde's tragic story serves as a reminder to extend our love and sympathy to those who may not seem to deserve it, especially in the face of societal judgement and condemnation.

In this section, we see how Wilde was humiliated and mocked by a jeering mob for half an hour. After his release from prison, Wilde left for Dieppe on the same day his wife and children moved abroad under different names. Wilde was reunited with Bosie shortly after his release but they once again parted ways when Bosie's mother offered to pay their debts if he returned home. Wilde moved to Paris where he lived in relative poverty, spending most of his time and money in bars and cafes, borrowing money wherever he could, and drinking heavily. Wilde's final piece of writing, the poem "Ballad of Reading Jail," was published in 1898 and his weight ballooned as he slowly inebriated himself to death. Wilde died at the age of 46 after he was baptized into the Catholic Church by a priest who visited his hotel as he had developed meningitis. Over a century later, Wilde received an official pardon from the British government, and while our society has become more generous towards Wilde's specific behavior, it remains moralistic towards others, and we should extend understanding and compassion to all those less talented and less witty figures who are facing difficulties.
