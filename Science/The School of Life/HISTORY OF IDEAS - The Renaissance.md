The Renaissance is a period in European history that saw a resurgence of interest in the style and ambitions of ancient Greek and Roman civilization. The main reasons for studying the Renaissance today are to rescue good, provocative and inspiring ideas that have been lost in the past, and to put them to use in relation to the dilemmas and problems of our own times. The Medici family, who were extremely ambitious about how to spend their money, were a key part of the Renaissance during its heyday. Their wealth allowed them to support many great thinkers and artists, including philosophers, architects and artists.

The Renaissance was a time of great change in the world of architecture, with architects such as Michelozzo di Bartolomeo creating beautiful and well-planned cities. The Renaissance thinkers believed that the public realm (where people live and work) should be beautiful and appealing in order to keep the richer members of society from withdrawing and concentrating exclusively on their own private estates. This theory was put into practice in many Renaissance cities and today, few cities are as beautiful as those created during this time period.

The Renaissance saw a flowering of great art, with artists such as Donatello, Frangelico, Whichello, Masaccio, Filippo Lippi, Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Titan producing some of the most beautiful and iconic pieces of art in history. One of the reasons for this flowering of art was the ideology of the Renaissance, which put philosophy at the center of its artistic vision. Marsilio Ficino was instrumental in developing this ideology, and his teachings had a profound impact on the artists of the Renaissance. Sexiness and beauty were used to convey the most important ideas of the era, and artists such as Titian were able to use their talents to bring philosophical ideas to life on the walls of the Vatican.
