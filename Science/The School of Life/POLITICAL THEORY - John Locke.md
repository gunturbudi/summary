John Locke's advocacy for religious tolerance was based on the belief that the state cannot determine the truth or falsehood of religious beliefs and enforcing a single outlook through violence was impractical. In his essay "A Letter Concerning Toleration," written in 1667, Locke argued that the state should only focus on maintaining order and upholding the well-being of society. His ideas influenced Europe's abandonment of locking up people for their religious beliefs and England's approach of deeming one's beliefs irrelevant to their status or prospects.

In this section, the focus is on John Locke's views on religious tolerance, as presented in his essay "A Letter Concerning Toleration," written in 1667. Locke's advocacy for toleration was grounded in the idea that it was impossible for the state or any human being to reliably determine the truth or falsehood of religious claims. Enforcing a single religious outlook through violence was also seen as impractical and counterproductive. Locke argued that the state's role should be limited to maintaining order and preserving the well-being of society. The idea of locking up people for their religious beliefs lost favor due to Locke's influence, and Europe began to envy England's approach, where one's beliefs were deemed irrelevant to their status or prospects.
