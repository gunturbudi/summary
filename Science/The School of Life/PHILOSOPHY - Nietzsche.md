In this section, we learn about the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, his life, and his key ideas, such as "self-overcoming," which is the process by which an "übermensch," or great-souled person, rises above their circumstances and embraces whatever life throws their way. Nietzsche's philosophy centers around four main recommendations, which include owning up to envy and recognizing that it is okay and that every person who makes us envious, such as a writer or a chef, is indicating what we are capable of becoming. Secondly, Nietzsche stated that one should not be a Christian, as he resented Christianity for protecting people from their envy and referred to it as a "giant machine for bitter denial." Finally, Nietzsche discouraged the consumption of alcohol, stating that drinking alcohol was not conducive to the search for happiness or living a fulfilled life, as it numbs pain and reassures us that things are just fine as they are, sapping us of the will to change our lives for the better.

In this section, it is explained that Nietzsche's statement that "God is dead" was not a celebratory one, but more of an observation on how religion has ended. Although he believed that religious beliefs were false, he also recognized the benefits of such beliefs in helping people deal with the problems of life. Nietzsche believed that culture, in the form of philosophy, art, music, and literature, should replace religion. He criticized the universities for turning humanities into dry academic exercises instead of using them as guides to life. Nietzsche called for the reformation of society to fill the gaps created by the disappearance of religion with philosophy and art. He believed it was the task of the philosopher to identify and solve the psychological challenges that every era faces, and in the 19th century, mass democracy and atheism were the main ones.
