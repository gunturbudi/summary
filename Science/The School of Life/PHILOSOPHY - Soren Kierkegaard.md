Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=D9JCwkx558o

Søren Kierkegaard is known for attacking the pillars of modern life and encouraging people to wake up from their sentimental illusions. He believed that the only intelligent response to life's horror is to laugh defiantly at it and emphasized the concept of "angst", a condition where one understands the many choices they face but has little understanding of how to exercise them wisely. Kierkegaard's philosophy of Christianity involved extreme surrender to a theology of simplicity and advocated for a 'leap of faith' into the idea of God as the total solution. Though his solutions may not be convincing, his diagnosis of the human condition is valuable, particularly in difficult times.

In this section, the philosopher Søren Kierkegaard is described as attacking the pillars of modern life, including family, trust in work, attachment to love and sense of purpose, all in an effort to wake people up from their cozy, sentimental illusions. He is particularly caustic about the ideal of passionate marriage and mocks the notion that one could ever fuse romantic love with marriage. Kierkegaard believed that the only intelligent tactical response to life's horror is to laugh defiantly at it, and he is often described as the founder of existentialism due to the themes that he explored. His philosophy emphasized a new word, "angst", to describe a condition where we understand how many choices we face and how little understanding we can ever have of how to exercise these choices wisely.

In this section, Kierkegaard's philosophy of Christianity is explored, where he advocated for extreme surrender to a theology of almost peasantlike simplicity. He believed in a 'leap of faith', recommending that one switches off their rational faculties and jumps into the idea of God as the total solution, as having faith meant losing one's mind and winning God. Although his solutions may not be convincing, Kierkegaard's diagnosis of the human condition is worth our attention, especially in times when the world has let us down, and we need someone who fully understands the dark places we're in.
