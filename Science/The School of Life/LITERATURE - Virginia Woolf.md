In this section, we learn about Virginia Woolf’s upbringing and how she was cognizant of the need for a new kind of writer that could capture the complexities of modernity. Despite her series of mental breakdowns, Woolf became a journalist and novelist, and her and her husband bought a small printing press which they used to publish her own work as well as the works of others. Woolf’s sensitivity to her surroundings made her a great observer of English literature and her work aimed to give voice to our neglected thoughts, such as bodily sensations and vulnerability.

In this section, the video explores Virginia Woolf's perspective on the compatibility of high and low culture, her gender-bending ideas, feminist beliefs, and her ability to depict the human mind in literature. Woolf believed that loving beauty and engaging with big ideas were compatible with an interest in shopping, cakes, and hats. Moreover, she thought that in order to grow, individuals need to seek experiences that blur what it means to be a "real man" or a "real woman." Her feminist rallying cry, "A Room of One's Own," demands that women must have dignity, education, income, and a room of their own to stand on the same intellectual footing as men. Lastly, Woolf's literature focuses on how it feels inside to know ourselves and other people.
