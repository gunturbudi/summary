# Summary of PHILOSOPHY - Thomas Aquinas

Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=GJvoFf2wCBU

The video discusses Thomas Aquinas and his philosophy, in which he believed that ancient Greek philosophy and Roman knowledge could be reconciled with Christianity. He argued that anyone could attain great truths through reason, and that there were both secular natural law and religious eternal law. Aquinas believed that most useful knowledge could be found through natural law, which helped break through a logjam in Christian thinking about non-Christians and knowledge. Unlike the Islamic world, which rejected reason and suffered harm to its once thriving intellectual culture, Aquinas encouraged open scientific inquiry and emphasized that knowledge should come from multiple sources.

legacy of ancient Greek philosophy and Roman knowledge was valuable and could be reconciled with Christianity. He taught that any person, regardless of religion, could attain great truths through reason, and that there were two types of law: secular natural law and religious eternal law. He stated that most of the useful knowledge can be found by atheists and secular-minded people through natural law. Aquinasâ€™ ideas were influential during a time when Islamic culture was also grappling with finding ways to reconcile reason and faith, and his ideas helped break through a logjam in Christian thinking about non-Christians and knowledge.

In this section, it is mentioned that the Muslim world's rejection of reason was harmful to its once thriving intellectual culture, unlike Christianity which did not suffer the same fate thanks to Thomas Aquinas' ideas. Despite his deep faith, Aquinas encouraged open scientific inquiry and emphasized that knowledge should come from multiple sources. This idea may seem obvious, but many civilizations have been harmed by people's reluctance to adopt this philosophy.
