In this section, the history of dating is explored, from pre-modern eras where relationships were strategic transactions between families, to the romantic idea in the 19th century that relationships should be based on sentiment rather than social status or lineage. The success of the play Charlie's Aunt suggests that old rules around dating were on their way out with the comedic atmosphere accepting some fustiness from a bygone era. The advent of unsupervised adolescent dating in literature in the early 1900s to the first oral contraceptive pill in 1960 paved the way for a future where dating could lead to sex, and eventually speed-dating in 1998, but we are reminded that our current dating habits may not be around for much longer.

In this section of the video, we see the evolution of modern dating, which is no longer influenced by parents and socio-economic status. Instead, emotional attraction and sexual compatibility are the primary measures of a successful relationship. With the advent of artificial intelligence, dating becomes easier, as it eliminates the guesswork and finds the optimal partner based on quirks and compatibility. Nevertheless, some people still have nostalgia for the old-fashioned romantic way of dating and occasionally recreate it for fun. This highlights the complexity of modern dating and suggests that we should not blame ourselves if we struggle to navigate it.
