Adam Smith believes that the key to solving the world's problems lies in educating consumers. He argues that it is primarily the consumer's tastes that cause problems in the world, not corporations.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Adam Smith was born in Scotland in 1723 and became a philosopher, wrote a major book about the importance of sympathy, and lectured on logic and aesthetics before becoming an economist. He observed that in modern businesses, tasks formerly done by one person in a single day could be split into many tasks carried out by multiple people over whole careers and he hailed this as a momentous development, predicting that national economies would become hugely richer the more specialised their workforces became. He also pointed out that consumer societies generate the surplus wealth that allows societies to look after their weakest members. He defended consumer capitalism on the basis of its ability to do more good for the poor than societies devoted to high ideals. He believed that governments should give the rich honour and status in return for doing all the good things that these narcissists wouldn't normally bother with.
