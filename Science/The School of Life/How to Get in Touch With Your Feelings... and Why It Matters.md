The speaker in the video explains how society's emphasis on status and money can cause individuals to lose touch with their emotions, only acknowledging those that are deemed important by others. It's important for individuals to give attention to all their emotions, including those that are often sidelined or belittled, such as sadness, anxiety, anger, and exhaustion, in order to reconnect with their feelings. The ultimate goal is to feel loved properly and be allowed to experience and register all emotions without belittlement.

In this section, the speaker discusses how individuals may lose touch with their feelings, as many sensations are not picked up by the mind due to it being calibrated to respond only to an agenda that emphasizes the pursuit of status and money. We tend to only notice those feelings that others pay attention to and ignore those that they sideline or belittle. Reconnecting with our lost feelings, therefore, involves an expanded sense of what it might be legitimate to experience, and we need permission to give our attention to all emotions, including sorrow, anxiety, anger, and tiredness, without being belittled. Ultimately, we need to be loved properly, to be allowed to register whatever we are actually going through, in order to know what we feel - a basic privilege that we should all have.
