The video challenges the notion that sociability is linked to party-going, arguing that true sociability is built through vulnerability and sharing of pain and confusion, and parties are not conducive to genuine social encounters. The narrator suggests that parties may only provide temporary relief from loneliness and true sociability requires an artful choreography and a good host who can create an environment in which strangers feel safe to share their sadness and despair. Those who dislike parties may not dislike people, but rather have a more ambitious conception of social contact.

In this section, the video challenges the assumption that sociability is synonymous with party-going. The narrator argues that true sociability is not built through cheerful talk, but rather through vulnerability and sharing of pain and confusion. However, the default social mode is to lie and present a facade of normalcy, which makes deep connections difficult to achieve. The video suggests that parties, as currently structured, are not conducive to genuine social encounters and may only provide temporary relief from loneliness. True sociability requires "artful choreography" and a "good host" who creates an environment in which strangers can feel safe to share their sadness and despair. Rather than disliking people, those who dislike parties may simply have a more ambitious conception of social contact.
