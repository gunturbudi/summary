# Summary of HISTORY OF IDEAS - Manners

Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=JCTzbc76WXY

The video "History of Ideas - Manners" explores the evolution of manners through different historical periods, tracing it back to the Magdalenian period where there were no practices of good manners and morals. As society evolved, so did the idea of good manners, personal hygiene, and chivalry, eventually leading to the creation of the Venetian glass goblet which influenced European dining culture. The video notes that while democratic manners may be a form of equality, they can also be a form of cruelty due to limited opportunities for genuine advancement. The absence of ties in a meeting of G8 countries is an inadvertent tribute to Jean-Jacques Rousseau's idea that ties symbolize hierarchy and oppression, but the video cautions that natural approaches to manners can cause unwitting cruelty and political subterfuge. Therefore, the aspiration to be well-mannered is not pretentious or fake but rather a way to consider others and not cause discomfort through one's behavior.

In this section, the transcript depicts the history of manners starting from the Magdalenian period to the creation of the Venetian glass goblet or flute. Initially, primitive humans didn't practice any manners and morals, including cannibalism and brutal violence towards the enemy. As civilization evolved, the Roman model of good personal hygiene and cleanliness became a significant part of society. Additionally, the idea of chivalry was designed to moderate the force and sexual impulses of men to protect the honor of women. Moreover, The Book of the Civilized Man published by Daniel of Beccles established guidelines for behaving in social circumstances, with aristocracy becoming more self-aware of their conduct.  The emergence of the Venetian glass goblet or flute defined a new kind of tableware and started influencing European dining culture.

In this section, we explore the history of manners through four different historical periods. In Venice, the fragility of the Venetian glass was deliberately designed to teach people gentleness, moderation, and kindness. In France, Catherine de' Medici introduced the fork and popularized new culinary fashions that slowed down the process of eating, making it more civilized. Swiss philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued that a return to the simplicity of the natural state would allow people to overcome the constraints of over-civilization. Finally, French aristocrat Alexis de Tocqueville was struck by the casual manners of American society, which he believed merely disguised class and wealth differences without doing away with them.

In this section, the video explores how democratic manners can be a form of cruelty when everyone is encouraged to believe that they are equal, but in reality, opportunities for genuine advancement are limited. The video then highlights how the absence of ties in a meeting of the G8 countries is an inadvertent tribute to Jean-Jacques Rousseau's idea that ties are a symbol of hierarchy and oppression. However, the video notes that the notion of casual manners can be a form of fakery, and the rise of the #MeToo movement reveals the limits of natural approaches to manners, which may cause unwitting cruelty and political subterfuge. The video then concludes that the aspiration to be well-mannered is not pretentious or fake but rather a way to show consideration for others and not to cause anyone discomfort through one's behavior.
