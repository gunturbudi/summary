The video explores the age-old debate of free will versus determinism, acknowledging that the answer cannot be objectively determined but must be found personally based on what is needed to feel fulfilled. The Stoic philosophy is discussed as an approach that recognizes humans as creatures with the ability to affect change but also subject to external forces. The point is made that while we may not have control over certain events, we always have the freedom to choose our attitude towards them. The idea of finding serenity and freedom in acceptance is promoted, alongside the development of emotional intelligence through a range of available resources.

In this section, the narrator explores the long-standing debate of free will versus determinism and explains that the debate becomes more interesting if we change the parameters to ask which is more relevant to us. Some people have high levels of defeatism, blaming everything but themselves for their circumstances, while others have an overly exaggerated notion of free will, believing that they can change everything with just their willpower. The debate cannot be answered objectively but must be determined personally, with an understanding of what we need to believe in to be fulfilled. The Stoics' approach that sees us as creatures always hovering between a free and determined state, like a dog tied to a cart, offers insight into our condition as creatures able to affect great change but never far from being subject to immensely powerful external necessities. We must accept what we cannot change and increase our sense of freedom by ensuring a good slack between our desires and reality.
