Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=9i4jb5XBX5s

Hobbes's theory is that people need a ruler to keep them in check, as without coercive power people would be able to do wicked things. However, Hobbes also predicts that if people were able to rule themselves, there would be no need for a ruler at all. This theory is dark, cautious, and has been used as a basis for predicting disastrous outcomes in revolutions.

Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Thomas Hobbes was a 17th century English philosopher who wrote about politics and the role of government. He argues that people should obey government authority, even if it is not always good, in order to avoid the risk of chaos and bloodshed. Hobbes's thinking is inseparable from one major event that began when he was 64 years old and was to mark him so deeply, it colored all his subsequent thinking: the English civil war. Hobbes died when he was 91, and everything he is remembered for today was written after the age of 60.
