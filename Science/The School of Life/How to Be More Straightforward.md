Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
The video discusses how straightforward people are gratifying to be around because their positions and intentions are always inherently unproblematic. What makes straightforward people gratifying is that they know what the issues are from the start, there is no need to guess decode, or translate. If these straightforward types don't want to do something, they will politely and in good time explain that it's really not for them. If they're worried a project is going awry, they won't pretend that all is well until a catastrophe can no longer be denied. If they're attracted to someone, they will find charming and inoffensive ways of making their feelings clear. In bed, they may want to please but they can also be honest and unashamed about what actually pleases them. The problem with complicated people is that they are painfully unsure about the legitimacy of their own desires which renders them unable to let the world know what they truly want and feel. They may appear to agree with everything we're saying but it emerges very far down the line that they had a host of reservations that require an age to uncover and resolve.
