In this section, the video explains that infidelity is viewed as a catastrophe instead of a problem because of the Romanticism philosophy that has dominated love since the 18th century. According to Romanticism, sex is not just a physical act but the central symbol of love. Therefore, an act of infidelity is viewed as a complete betrayal of love and devotion. However, the video suggests that there are cases where infidelity may mean something different, such as a passing desire for erotic excitement that does not undermine ongoing sincere commitment to a partner. The video concludes that to recover from infidelity, an honest examination of one's own thoughts and experience of infidelity could lead to understanding, acceptance, and forgiveness, rather than relying on the traditional view of Romanticism.
