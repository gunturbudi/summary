In this section, we learn how Flaubert used the tragic story of Madame Delamare's suicide to create the plot structure for his masterpiece, Madame Bovary, which presents the tensions and difficulties of married life without taking sides. Flaubert enjoyed unsettling easy answers by presenting Emma Bovary sympathetically, only to undercut her with an ironic remark. The novel makes readers feel pity and an understanding of the cruelty and senselessness of life. Furthermore, the book suggests that reading bad romantic novels had given Emma Bovary an unrealistic and overly-rosy picture of love, misleading her about the realities of marriage, causing her to have affairs, spend recklessly, and eventually take her own life. The novel ends in tragedy, inspiring readers to abandon the judgmental perspective on failure and defeat that we usually take, and become more generous toward the foolishness and errors that are endemic to our nature.

In this section, we see how Gustave Flaubert found the reverence given to newspapers to be neo-religious; he believed newspapers encouraged idiocy and he compiled a dictionary of clich√©s organized by topic which became a collection of human stupidity, lazily written and uncreative. Flaubert, although he was a middle-class Frenchman, was rather disdainful of the bourgeoisie class and had contempt for the nation's "civilization" which boasted of creating poison, pastry, guillotine, and a royal family. Flaubert's love of humanity transcended all borders and believed that the idea of living in a nation that hates and belittles other nations based on their maps is profoundly silly. In short, Flaubert was an "earthly" and "humanitarian" man who embraced simplicity, honesty, generosity, and life itself.
