Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Theodor Adorno was a philosopher and social critic who argued that modern society corrupts and degrades us. He saw the primary focus for progressive thinkers as the study of how the working and middle classes of developed nations think and feel, and in particular the manner in which they spend their evenings and weekends. He had a highly ambitious view of what leisure time should be for, believing that it should be used to expand and develop ourselves to reach after our better nature and to acquire the tools necessary to change society. Adorno was closely connected with a pioneering institute of social research, also known as the Frankfurt School, which aimed to develop a psychological understanding of the problems thrown up by modern capitalism. He drew attention to three significant ways in which capitalism corrupts and degrades us: by focusing relentlessly on the emotions around romantic love, by suggesting that happiness can only come from finding one very special person, and by keeping us lonely and consuming. Adorno was writing at the dawn of the age of the psychological questionnaire, and these instruments are still in use today.
