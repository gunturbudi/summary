In this section, the differences between colons and semicolons are discussed. Though they might appear similar, the distinctions between them are quite simple. Colons are used to explain something in more detail or identify a set of things while semicolons are used to link two sentences that might stand-alone, but their connection is significant. While the colon is logical and unpacks the things presented, the semicolon connects things that are related but not necessarily dependent. The tone is mature and tentative as it introduces ideas, linking them together invites reflections and interesting juxtapositions instead of closing off a thought as the colon does.
