Plato's four key ideas to make life more fulfilled include thinking more critically, engaging in self-therapy through philosophy, allowing our lovers to change us for the better, and recognizing the importance of beauty. Additionally, Plato believed in creating a new class of leaders known as the Guardians, who would serve as wise role models for society, and replacing democratic government with philosopher-kings who could lead rationally. Plato saw philosophy as a means for positive change and his ideas continue to inspire and provoke thought.

In this section, we learn about the four big ideas of Plato that can make life more fulfilled. Firstly, he believes that we should think more rather than go along with popular opinions. Plato emphasizes on the need of engaging in self-therapy through philosophy and examining our own ideas to strengthen our self-knowledge. Secondly, he believes in the idea of letting our lovers change us and we can become a better version of ourselves by being close to someone who has qualities that we lack. Thirdly, Plato talks about the importance of beauty and how beautiful objects whisper important truths to us about the good life. Lastly, Plato was the world's first utopia thinker and spent a lot of time thinking about how society and the government should ideally be organized to produce fulfilled people instead of being just focused on military power or fame.

In this section, it is discussed how Plato believed that in order to make Athens a better place, there needed to be a new set of people in power. He wanted to replace the current flawed set of celebrities with those he called Guardians, who would be considered as wise and good models for society to follow. Plato also wanted to end democracy in Athens, not to replace it with a horrid dictatorship but to ensure that the people who voted had become philosophers who could think rationally. He wanted politicians to become philosophers or philosophers kings in order for the world to be right. Plato's ideas remain deeply provocative and fascinating as he wanted philosophy to be a tool to help change the world, an example we should continue to be inspired by.
