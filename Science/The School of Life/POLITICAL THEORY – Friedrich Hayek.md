The first half of Friedrich Hayek's career is marked by his work on economic theory and his first foray out from dry arguments, with the publication of "The Road to Serfdom." Hayek saw the writing of this book as a form of warfare, and it was an attempt to save people from themselves or more accurately from centralized government. Hayek put forward several key arguments, including that there was nothing intrinsic to Germans that caused them to adopt authoritarian forms of government, that state planning led societies to sleepwalk into dictatorship, and that no individual could actually make rational choices in regards to economic problems due to their lack of information. Despite the popular acclaim of "The Road to Serfdom," some of Hayek's own colleagues saw it as a lightweight form of journalism rather than as a form of scholarship. Hayek finally responded to Keynes in 1960 with "The Constitution of Liberty." In this book, Hayek outlines a theory of liberty where markets are the principal method of economic organization and where the free market represents a form of collective agreement made amongst all of the people in an economy.

Hayek's book, Liberty, laid out his practical vision for where the line between the state and the market should be drawn, and it was highly influential among the political right. A story is told that at a meeting with a conservative research department in 1975, Margaret Thatcher responded to a policy paper on political philosophy by reaching into a handbag and withdrawing a copy of the constitution of Liberty, holding it aloft. Thatcher declared this is what we believe as the 20th century unfolded, and Hayek's ideas gained more common currency. The notion that the state should limit itself to providing a legal framework within which entrepreneurs can engage with free markets is now at the heart of much of economic thinking, and many politicians and large sections of the public are skeptical about the ability of the state to plan and undertake anything but the most simple of economic tasks. This skepticism was best testified to by the Road to Serfdom hitting the number one spot on the Amazon book bestseller list in early 2010 despite it having been written over 60 years ago.
