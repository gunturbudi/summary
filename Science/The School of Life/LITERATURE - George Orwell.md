In this section, we learn that George Orwell was a political writer who wanted to use art to make the world a better place. Although he was an exemplary member of the social group of intellectuals, Orwell hated intellectuals and their lack of patriotism, physical vigor, and preponderance for pretension and dishonesty. Instead, he championed ordinary life and the people who work on ordinary jobs, who don't have much of education, who won't achieve greatness but who nevertheless inspire him with their love, care for others, work, and have large thoughts about the deepest questions, in ways he finds especially admirable. Orwell's journey into ordinary life began in 1928, when he left the privileges of his class to work in a series of menial service jobs in the French and English capitals, which he later recounted in his book, "Down and Out in Paris and London."

In this section, it is discussed how George Orwell's focus on ordinary people inspired his curiosity about a range of themes not often considered in literature. He believed that it was the role of literary journalism to flesh out the human beings behind the statistics and to correct prejudice and casual racism, which helped him avoid turning people into abstractions. In addition, his two famous books, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-four, were anchored in deep thinking that he had done all his adult life about how literature should be written in an age of mass communication. His genius was to hit upon the idea of forming a fable, like those of Aesop, Walt Disney, La Fontaine, and Beatrix Potter, to carry his story to a mass audience that could be understood by more or less anyone.

In this section, the video highlights George Orwell's success in predicting social trends and warning society about its own alarming patterns through his reinvention of fables and science fiction. His book, 1984, portrays a society with omnipresent screens, sophisticated entertainment, and empty-headed news reports, wrapped up in constant reference to freedom, which lulls the citizens into a sense of enslavement. Orwell highlights the importance of human beings behaving better and gives us the tools to continue to imagine writing in our own time. Ultimately, his message reminds us that it is one of the most important instructions in life.
