Auguste Comte, a French sociologist of the 19th century, attempted to create a new type of religion that addressed the emotional and intellectual demands of modern people. Due to his belief that intelligent individuals could no longer believe in God because of scientific advancements, he proposed a scientific religion that rejected supernatural elements. His proposals included the introduction of a new calendar animated by a pantheon of secular heroes, classes and sermons, and portraits of his girlfriend placed around buildings to provide consolation. Comte's ideas were mostly unreadable, but his efforts to create a new type of religion attracted the interest of John Stuart Mill and gained traction in Britain. Comte also suggested the construction of "Temples for Humanity" to promote his scientific religion as a replacement for traditional religion. Despite Comte's death and many practical obstacles his project faced, his followers continued the work, leading to the establishment of secular services in several countries, including Brazil. Although Comte's religion did not become popular, it identified a psychic space in atheistic society that still remains to be resolved.

In this section, we learn about Auguste Comte's proposal to construct secular churches, or "Temples for Humanity," as a way to promote his scientific religion, which was meant to serve as a replacement for traditional religion. He suggested that each temple be funded by a banker, who would have their bust placed above the door in recognition of their generosity. Inside, there would be lectures, singing, celebrations, and public discussions, with sumptuous works of art commemorating the greatest moments and finest men and women of history displayed on the walls. Despite Comte's death at age 59 in 1857 and the many practical obstacles his project faced, his followers continued the work, leading to the establishment of secular services in several countries, including Brazil, where the Templo de la Humanidad remains a small but permanent fixture in the spiritual life of the country. Comte's religion may have failed to become a truly popular religion, but it identified a psychic space in atheistic society, which continues to lie fallow and to invite resolution.
