He also reflects on the comfort of his surroundings, such as the softness of his pillow, while listening to the distant sounds of the night. The narrator's experiences while asleep are vivid and often conjure up memories from his past or imagined scenarios, and he finds solace in being able to fall back asleep and escape into his dreams.

In this section of the transcript, the speaker reflects on the experience of waking up from a dream of an intimate encounter with a woman and feeling disoriented in the darkness of the room. The speaker's mind attempts to locate itself in time and space while the body tries to deduce the location of the furniture and the position of limbs. Through memory and imagination, the speaker is able to reconstruct the sense of place and time, and even recall a childhood thought. The passage illustrates the complex interplay between the mind and the body, and how memory can be used to orient oneself in space and time.

In this section, the speaker recalls various bedrooms they have slept in throughout their life. They describe the different feelings and memories associated with each room, from the winter bedrooms where one is nestled in a warm, smoky cocoon to the summer bedrooms where one can sleep almost in the open air. The speaker also mentions the Louis XVI bedroom and the small bedroom, both of which had unique qualities that affected the speaker's state of mind.

In this section of the transcript, the narrator describes the role of habit in making a particular lodging habitable. Their good angel of certainty had brought everything in the room to a standstill and laid them in their proper positions in the darkness. Although they were not present in any of the houses they had imagined upon waking, they spent the greater part of the night remembering their life in various places they had lived before, and their old preoccupations came back to them. In the past, they were given a magic lantern to distract them from their unhappiness. While the narrator found some charm and ancient reflections of history in the supernatural multi-colored apparitions that displayed on the walls, they also found an intrusion of mystery and beauty into a room they had already filled with themselves due to the anesthetizing influence of habit.

The narrator also reflects on the personalities and quirks of his family members, particularly his grandmother, who enjoys taking walks in the rain and is often tormented by his great aunt.

In this section, the speaker describes a room that served as a refuge for him from the outside world, a place where he could read, daydream, cry, and explore sensual pleasure in privacy. It was the only room he was allowed to lock, and he spent much of his time there. However, he was unaware that his grandmother, who was worried about his health and future, closely monitored his every move and showed concern about his weak will and delicate health. The speaker also notes the image of his grandmother's beautiful face, which had aged with brown furrowed cheeks, raised up toward the sky as she went out for her daily walks.
