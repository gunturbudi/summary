He also highlights the importance of recognizing our flaws and learning to accommodate and forgive our partners.

In this section, Alain de Botton discusses the influence of Romanticism on our current ideas about love. He argues that Romanticism has led us to believe that each of us has a soul mate waiting for us, and that we will find that person through instinct rather than being matched up by elders or parents. The Romantic notion of the special feeling of finding a soul mate has become highly venerated, and not feeling it may make people feel like there is something wrong with them. The influence of Romanticism can be felt in our current society even if we don't know about it or acknowledge it, and it has shaped the way we think about love and relationships.

In this section, Alain de Botton discusses how romanticism is intertwined with the concept of the crush and the immediate feeling of knowing you have met your soulmate. Romantics were also dedicated to the ideal of "happily ever after," but many of them died young, creating a relationship that was forever in innocence. Additionally, the romantics were very focused on nature and sex as the ultimate expression of love, which made adultery catastrophic. While the ideas of romanticism are very beautiful and exciting, de Botton believes they have been a catastrophe for our capacity to have good long-term relationships, as they replaced a previous view of human nature as fragile and broken with an excessively optimistic view of purity and goodness in every individual.

00:10:00
In this section, Alain de Botton discusses how the Romantic movement placed an emphasis on children being inherently good and pure, rejecting the older view associated with Christian theologians that saw humankind as fundamentally sinful. However, he highlights the problematic nature of this ideology for relationships, as it creates a backdrop where both partners are seen as perfect, leading to issues with self-righteousness when faults inevitably emerge. He suggests that it is important to recognize that everyone is in some way deeply flawed and crazy and that we lack self-knowledge due to a conspiracy of silence around us. In turn, this low self-awareness can cause issues in how we approach relationships, as we fail to recognize our own flaws and those of our partners.

00:15:00
In this section, philosopher Alain de Botton discusses the faults of romanticism and how it has caused many people to place an increased emphasis on instinct and finding the "right" person. He argues that both partners need to have a handle on their imperfections in order to make the relationship work, and suggests that it would be necessary to reveal one's insanities to the other person as a gift to help each other navigate the difficulties that may arise. Furthermore, de Botton explains that the way that we love as adults is closely related to the way that we were loved as children, which often leads to a perpetuation of dysfunction. In our search for adult love, we may actually be searching for familiarity rather than true compatibility, leading us to dismiss potential partners who do not fit the dysfunctional mold that we are accustomed to.

In this section, the speaker discusses the romanticized idea of honesty in relationships and how it can lead to unrealistic expectations. Romanticism places a high value on honesty in a relationship, allowing individuals to remove their emotional barriers and be completely honest with their partner. However, this romantic ideal ignores the fact that not everyone can handle complete honesty all the time, and that some editing and filtering is necessary in the name of love. Additionally, Romanticism fails to address the practical and mundane aspects of relationships, such as doing laundry and raising children. This lack of preparation can lead to difficulties in the relationship when the initial emotional high has subsided.

00:25:00
In this section, Alain de Botton discusses some of the central beliefs of Romanticism that have unfortunately led to the downfall of many relationships. Firstly, Romantics believed that the practical sides of life, such as laundry and split responsibilities, have no place in a good love life, and this belief has led to many arguments and unhappiness in relationships. Secondly, Romantics believed that too much analysis of one's feelings and emotions destroys them, and that intuitive understanding should be enough between two people. However, this has led to an increase in sulking and bitterness as people are expected to understand each other without the need for communication, which can ultimately lead to relationship breakdowns.

00:30:00
In this section, Alain de Botton discusses the problems with romantic ideals of love that emphasize an unattainable goal of being able to intuit the contents of another's soul and loving all aspects of another person, even the imperfect. He argues that these unrealistic expectations lead to disappointment and disharmony in relationships. Instead, he suggests a more helpful philosophy from ancient Greeks which considers love as admiration for the perfect sides of another person and as a process of mutual education where two people undertake to educate each other to become better versions of themselves.

00:35:00
In this section, philosopher Alain de Botton discusses how love is a process of mutual education and why we are such bad teachers. He explains that many relationship arguments can essentially be seen as failed teaching moments, and one of the reasons this happens is because we don't think it's legitimate to teach. However, de Botton points out that the best way to be a calm teacher is not to be too invested in the other person's response. He also notes that nagging and shirking are common when love's classroom has failed. De Botton believes that we shouldn't lower our expectations for love; instead, we should go into relationships with high expectations, but we need to understand how to reach those expectations.

laugh at them and we identify with them. In this section, Alain de Botton discusses the importance of seeing one's partner as a child to better understand their behavior. He argues that all of us are broken in some way, and our partners need to learn to accommodate and forgive us. Developing a sense of humor is essential in any relationship, as it allows partners to see each other's comedic and idiotic aspects. Overall, de Botton argues that love is ultimately a skill that needs to be learned and developed, rather than something that is purely intuitive.

00:45:00
In this section, Alain de Botton discusses the importance of seeing someone in a different light when we are in romantic relationships. He emphasizes that we need to have the ethical imagination to turn someone from an idiot to a lovable one as it signifies maturity. It is important to realize that no one is perfect, and we need to temper our punitive interpretations of whoever we have gotten together with by understanding everyone's problematic behavior. In terms of sexuality, he notes that safety and excitement are the two things that people usually want but are in different directions. So, one has to choose between safety, which has loyalty and coziness, and leads to boredom sometimes, or excitement, which is thrilling and exciting but leads to chaos and confusion. Ultimately, we need to choose between varieties of suffering.

00:50:00
In this section, philosopher and writer Alain de Botton discusses the peculiar British gift of melancholy and how it can be a useful emotion in dealing with life's imperfections. He also touches on the topic of marriage and why people still enter into it despite knowing its flaws. De Botton argues that being locked in a marriage is a cage, but it is willingly entered into because there is some piece of maturity and growth that can only happen in an environment where neither person can immediately quit the room. He believes that it is possible to have long-term relationships, but a checklist must be run through to ensure that both parties are ready for the long-term commitment.

00:55:00
In this section, a member of the audience asks Alain de Botton about the possibility of creating a dating site or tool that is more sophisticated than the ones that already exist. De Botton responds that Silicon Valley is already invested in creating tools that can help people find their soulmate. However, he cautions that the emphasis on finding the "right" person can be unhelpful, as everyone is imperfect and cannot fully understand or satisfy another person's needs. Instead, he suggests that we need tools that teach patience, resourcefulness, forgiveness, and humor in dating, rather than just matching algorithms. De Botton also advocates for creating a new kind of technology, specifically one that teaches forgiveness, which is currently beyond current technological capabilities.

In this section, philosopher Alain de Botton discusses the importance of learning about love and relationships through mediums like novels and schools. He mentions the unromantic connotations of seeking help for relationship issues, such as seeing a therapist, but believes that examining a relationship logically is a positive step that indicates a couple's commitment to resolving their issues. De Botton also shares his thoughts on the use of technology like Tinder for finding love, saying that it places too much emphasis on the moment of choice and leads to an impatient search and a throwaway culture. He believes that the more one knows about love, the less important it becomes who they are loving and emphasizes the importance of discovering the humanity behind profiles before making judgments. Finally, de Botton stresses the importance of timing in sharing one's insanities with a partner, as doing so at the wrong time can lead to the other person feeling unsympathetic and hurt.

01:05:00
In this section, Alain de Botton discusses how the Romantics believed in authenticity and being true to your feelings, which could sometimes lead to trouble in expressing negative thoughts to others. The discussion then shifts to the topic of love and money, with de Botton highlighting Jane Austen's novels and how they take a fascinating look at the financial aspect of relationships. De Botton encourages a practical recognition of what money can contribute to a good relationship, rather than believing that love and money have nothing to do with one another. Lastly, de Botton emphasizes the importance of appreciation in relationships, noting that possession can sometimes prevent us from truly valuing what we have.

01:10:00
In this section, Alain de Botton explains that the feeling that things are forever and that we already possess them prevents us from noticing the beauty and meaning in our lives. De Botton believes that the persistent age of Romanticism is commercial and easier to sell in Hollywood movies than other aspects of relationships, like long-term commitment. He encourages people to approach love with a healthy belief that overcoming certain romantic illusions is the best way to improve relationships.
