The video discusses the idea of emotional education, or the understanding of how to live emotionally well. The school of life recommends that people try to be emotionally sane, or have a handle on what is wrong with them, in order to build friendship and consolation. The world is a cruel place, and one of the ways that it is cruel is by judging people based on their job status or clothes.

In this video, Alain de Botton discusses the changing mindset of society towards success and failure. He argues that in a meritocratic society, those who succeed are determined by their own efforts, rather than luck. This has a negative psychological impact, as it leads to a world in which those who are at the bottom deserve to be there.

French sociologist Emile Durkheim studied the differences between preindustrial and industrialized societies, focusing on how people's biography is solely based on their performance in modern society. Durkheim observed that in modern societies, there are a number of people who cannot face what they've become, leading to a need for respect and friendship that is not always realized. In this short video, Durkheim challenges people to live as though a relationship with a stranger is the key to a fulfilling life. He asks participants to introduce themselves to a stranger in just two minutes, something many people are afraid to do.

The idea of "soulmates" and "finding them" is a main tenant of Romanticism. This movement of ideas also teaches that everyone has a 'soulmate', and that they will be found by instinct. Additionally, Romanticism coincides with the secularization of society, and the belief that love can be found in nature. However, Romanticism also has a darker side, as it teaches that when you find your 'soulmate', you will live together forever. This can be a problem, as people are often killed due to adultery.

The speaker discusses the idea that most people have a problem with confidence â€“ specifically, an issue with feeling like they're not good enough. He suggests that by accepting our own flaws and limitations, we can build a sense of confidence.

One exercise the speaker recommends is for people to complete the following sentence: If I dared to be more selfish, I would not go for two minutes. Hearing the other person out is key, as it allows them to express their own thoughts and feelings. If someone is too selfish to listen to someone else, they are probably too selfish to be successful in life.
