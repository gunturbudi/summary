Jean-Jacques Rousseau was a French philosopher who wrote extensively on many topics, including ethics, political theory, and sociology. He is best known for his work on human nature and his advocacy of naturalistic sentiment over rationality. Rousseau's contemporaries may have seen Julie, one of his novels, as unwise and his feelings as a passing fancy, but he painted her love in a higher light. He urged readers to see its grandeur, depth, and honor, and his work on his own life provides insights into his philosophy.
