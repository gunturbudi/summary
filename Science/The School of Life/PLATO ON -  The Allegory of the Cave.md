00:00:00
The Allegory of the Cave is a story that compares the life of people before they learn about philosophy and the life of people after they learn about philosophy. The cave dwellers are humans before philosophy, and the sun is the light of reason. The newly enlightened man decides to leave the sunlit upper world and go back into the cave to help out his companions who are still mired in confusion and error. He is unimpressive to the cave dwellers when he first returns, but eventually explains what the sun is and what a real tree is like. The cave dwellers get sarcastic and eventually plot to kill him. Plato recommends a process of widespread carefully administered philosophical education in order to help people learn to see the true forms of things and to be patient when people are overconfident.
