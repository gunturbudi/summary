The video discusses the idea of "good enough" and how it can be helpful in reducing anxiety and depression. It cites the example of psychoanalyst, Donald Winnicott, who developed the concept in relation to parenting. Winnicott believed that the parents' anxiety and despair came from an excessive hope and pursuit of perfectionism, and that in order to reduce this, parents needed to feel like they were "good enough" parents. This idea can be applied to other areas of life, such as work and relationships. Winnicott's idea has since been adapted and expanded upon by other psychoanalysts.
