Jean-Paul Sartre's philosophy of Existentialism emphasizes that everything is possible if one realizes that nothing is pre-ordained by God. Living without considering freedom is considered Bad Faith, and Sartre believed that capitalism discourages freedom and falsely creates a sense of necessity. Sartre was interested in Marxist ideas that reduced the role of material considerations in people's lives, and he participated in protests, admired Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, and believed in creating new institutions to dismantle oppressive structures. He encourages us to accept the fluidity of existence and relinquish the idea of preordained logic, bringing immense relief from oppressive traditions and the status quo.

In this section, Sartre’s philosophy of Existentialism is built around the idea that things are weirder and more uncertain than we think, and that to be truly free, one should realize that everything is possible and nothing is pre-ordained with a sense of purpose by God. The phenomenon of living without taking freedom properly into account is Bad Faith, which is to insist that things have to be a certain way and shutting our eyes to other options. Sartre believed that capitalism discourages people from experiencing freedom and creates a sense of necessity which doesn’t exist in reality, which led him to believe that we are free to dismantle it.
