The main obstacle to self-knowledge and a flourishing life is the tendency of one part of our minds to lie to the other. We lie for reasons such as avoiding pain, but in so doing, we damage our chances of happiness. There are four things we particularly like to lie to ourselves about: about all the problematic aspects of our lives, our lack of interest in certain things, our lack of concern, and our general disapproval. We also grow censorious and defensive of our behavior and people. We don't admit that we're sad about something, but we generalize and universalize the sadness. We spread the pain in order to keep its specific causes from being the focus of attention. Lying to ourselves can be a problem because we often pay a high price for the short-term calm it provides.
