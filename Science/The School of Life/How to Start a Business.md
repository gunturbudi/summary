The video suggests that there are two types of businesses: pragmatic ones that see business as a means to an end, and those that are passionate about what they do and are committed to excellence, quality, and a long-term focus. Being passionate is the key to finding fulfillment and making an honest living, and the video directs viewers to a guidebook for finding satisfying work.

In this section, it is noted that the majority of businesses actually fall into the category of pragmatic businesses, i.e., those that don't love what they do and simply see their business as a means to a financial end. However, there is another type of business, one of love, where the owner has a total commitment to excellence, a desire to reinvest all profits into guaranteeing the product's quality and a long-term focus. These businesses may not always be successful in the financial sense, but for the owners, money is only ever a means to a more purposeful and meaningful end.

In this section, the speaker points out that many businesses are run by people who are not passionate about what they do, and are just waiting to sell up. However, to succeed in business, one doesn't need to be extremely original or have invented anything new. Rather, it is more important to offer the world something that one loves intensely, in order to find fulfillment and make an honest living. The speaker directs viewers to their book, A Job to Love, which is a guide to finding satisfying work.
