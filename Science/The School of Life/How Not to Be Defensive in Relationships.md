In this section, the video discusses how we often approach arguments in relationships in a manner that prioritizes winning over personal growth. Such confrontational attitudes when attacking a partner's flaws can cause defensiveness and hinder personal development. When the partner being accused denies everything, it is not due to the accusation being wrong, but their fear of being worthless, unlovable, and unworthy of forgiveness.
