# Summary of PHILOSOPHY - René Descartes

Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=CAjWUrwvxs4

René Descartes was a French philosopher who believed in the power of logic and introspection guided by definition to achieve knowledge. He proposed the 'method of doubts' to sort out big problems by breaking them down into small, understandable sections through incisive questions. Descartes believed in grounding all our ideas in individual experience and reason rather than authority and tradition. The philosopher also developed the famous phrase, 'I think therefore I am,' which he used as a foundational point for epistemological certainty. Descartes' work on passions and the discipline of virtue is also discussed, where he believed that controlling passions was key to enjoying a virtuous life and understanding them was important instead of vanquishing them. He died of pneumonia in 1650, and remembering him for 'I think therefore I am' is not shallow, as it captures his commitment to independent, rationally-founded existence.

Descartes believed in grounding all our ideas in individual experience and reason rather than authority and tradition. The philosopher also developed the famous phrase, 'I think therefore I am,' which he used as a foundational point for epistemological certainty. Descartes epitomizes the solitary end of philosophy, where individuals can solve deep problems within themselves by reflecting on personal experiences rather than relying on inherited wisdom.

In this section, Descartes' work on passions and the discipline of virtue is discussed. He believed that controlling passions was key to enjoying a virtuous life, and identified six fundamental passions: wonder, love, hatred, desire, joy, and sadness. Rather than vanquishing passions, he believed in understanding and controlling them. Descartes attracted powerful admirers, including Queen Christina of Sweden, who invited him to tutor her in philosophy and passions. However, the harsh cold of Sweden made Descartes ill, and he died of pneumonia in 1650. Remembering Descartes for 'I think therefore I am' is not shallow as it captures his commitment to independent, rationally-founded existence.
