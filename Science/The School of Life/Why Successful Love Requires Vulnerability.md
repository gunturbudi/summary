In this section, the speaker emphasizes the crucial role of vulnerability in successful relationships, highlighting that we cannot be good lovers if we do not know how to be vulnerable. Being vulnerable means showing our partners who we really are, with all our fragility, unusualness, fears, and inadequacies. It involves confessing to our partners that we may not always meet the expectations of what an ideal adult should be. Although a certain kind of no-nonsense partner might tell us to grow up, it is fatal to being in an intimate relationship. To dare to be vulnerable means having faith that whatever we feel ashamed of must have counterparts in other people. Vulnerability requires us to be honest and authentic, sharing the frightened small places of our past, and letting our partners witness our inner selves that date back to childhood.

By finding a partner who allows us to be vulnerable, we can heal the wounds of the past and learn to speak the "language of weakness". This ultimately helps us to form a more accurate idea of what it means to be an adult.
