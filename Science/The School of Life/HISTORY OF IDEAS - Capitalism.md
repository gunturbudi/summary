Detail Summary:

The history of ideas shows that capitalism has been met with disappointment, frustration, and suspicion since its inception. In Padua, Giotto painted Jesus and the Money Lenders, and in Venice, Luca Pacioli published the first book on accounting. Calvin's sermons about thrift and hard work were influential for Protestantism, and in Delft, Johannes Vermeer painted The Lacemaker. Adam Smith's book, The Wealth of Nations, explained how capitalist economies grow and was influential for the British economy. However, not all people were won over, and in 1854, Karl Marx published Das Kapital, which critiqued capitalism.

Charles Dickens publishes a novel, Hard Times, in 1860 that takes aim at capitalists like Mr. Gradgrind who abuse their workers, exploit young children in mines and chimneys, and use their relentless capitalist logic to blind them to their desecration of nature and human life. In 1976, East Germans riot over the unavailability of coffee, and in 1999, Seattle, USA, protesters rally against global capitalism. The police use a heavy hand, firing tear gas into the crowds, and 2000 are arrested.
