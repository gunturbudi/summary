Voltaire's famous phrase "we must cultivate our garden" from his novel Candide suggests that individuals should maintain a distance from the world and instead focus on cultivating their personal gardens, which in turn guarantees a distance between ourselves and the world's aggravations and dangers. This concept of "horticultural quietism" involves focusing on cultivating one's own small plot of land rather than trying to cultivate the whole of humanity. By doing so, we can find peace of mind and free ourselves from constant worry about what's happening in the broader world.
