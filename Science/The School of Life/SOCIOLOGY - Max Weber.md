Max Weber is one of the foremost philosophers of sociology, and his work on capitalism is seminal. He argued that Protestantism, specifically Calvinism, was the key factor in creating the capitalist system. This system works best in countries with a Protestant religious heritage, but is not as successful in other countries. Weber would likely counsel those interested in spreading capitalism to concentrate on culture, as attitudes towards life, hope, and what it means to be a "good person" are key factors in determining an economy's success.
