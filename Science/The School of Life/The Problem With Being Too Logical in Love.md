The video discusses how being too logical in relationships can neglect the emotional needs of a partner, leading to frustration and anger. In such situations, a partner primarily wants empathy and reassurance rather than just being told why they shouldn't have their fears and pain. Instead of dismissing their partner's feelings as irrational, a deeper sense of logical thinking that considers whether they've hurt or neglected their partner can lead to a healthier and more caring relationship.

In this section, the video discusses how being too logical in love can actually lead to anger and frustration from one's partner. When in the midst of difficulties, what one primarily wants from a partner is a sense that they understand what we're going through and showing empathy. In such situations, being too logical can come across as an act of impatience. An excessively logical approach discounts the origins of fears and pain and concentrates instead on why we shouldn't have them, which ultimately ends up being maddening when in pain. Rather than wanting their partner to stop being reasonable, individuals want them to apply their intelligence to the task of reassurance and to enter into the weirder parts of their experience by remembering their own.
