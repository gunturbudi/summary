In this section, we learn about Michel Foucaultâ€™s background and early life struggles with his sexuality and mental health. He found solace in the works of Nietzsche, who valued learning from history as it can help in leading a better life in our own times. Eight years later, Foucault published "Madness and Civilization," which argued that mentally ill people were treated better in the Renaissance than in later centuries, which saw the medicalization and institutionalization of the mentally ill. In "The Birth of The Clinic," Foucault attacked the medical profession's dehumanizing attitude towards patients, viewing them as a set of organs rather than individuals to be considered as a whole entity. "Discipline and Punish" followed, where Foucault criticized the modern bourgeois capitalist state's power.

In this section, Michel Foucault's critiques on the modern prison system and the medicalization of sex are summarized. Foucault argued that the modern prison system is more barbaric because it operates behind locked gates and removes the prisoner's body as a focus of admiration. He also noted that the modern medicalization of sex has led to the loss of spontaneity and imagination, unlike the "ars erotica" in ancient cultures. Foucault believed that we should look back at history to see better ways of doing things and improve how we live now. Although academic historians have criticized Foucault's work, he can inspire us to question dominant ideas and institutions in our times and make history life-enhancing and philosophically rich again.
