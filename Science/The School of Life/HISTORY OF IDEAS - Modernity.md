Detail Summary:

Since the middle of the 18th century, people have become aware of living in an age of radical difference from any other in which they have called the modern age. This has led to a loss of faith in the intervention of divine forces in earthly affairs, as well as a shift in focus to understanding natural events through reason. Modernity has also led to a change in consciousness, with people becoming more individualistic and self-fulfilled. 

The modern world has been marked by a number of significant developments, including the loss of faith in gods, the rise of science and technology, the development of mass media and the rise of cities. These changes have led to a more open and tolerant society, which is still growing and evolving.
