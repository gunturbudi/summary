Alain de Botton discusses how art replaced religion as a source of consolation and meaning for people after the decline of religion in the 19th century. While culture was suggested as a replacement, it is no longer acceptable to bring the aches and pains of our souls to the guardians of culture. Instead, people are now told to read self-help books. However, de Botton argues that culture can provide comfort and guidance to help us with our psychological frailties. He introduces a new book about art as therapy, which argues that we should engage with art to help us cope with and comprehend our personal struggles.

In this section, Alain de Botton discusses how art has replaced religion as a source of consolation and meaning for people. At the beginning of the 19th century, the decline of religion left people worried about where they would find moral guidance and other emotional support. Critics like Matthew Arnold and John Ruskin suggested that culture could take up the slack left by the departure of religion. However, while this idea is beautiful, it is no longer acceptable to bring the aches and pains of our souls to the guardians of culture. Instead, if you're confused or terrified, the answer given is to read a self-help book. But Alain de Botton argues that we are desperate creatures in need of support and that culture can provide us with the comfort and guidance that we need.

In this section, Alain de Botton introduces a new book he wrote with colleague John Armstrong about art as therapy. He explains that the book argues that we should use art as a way to help us with our psychological frailties, rather than only as a means of appreciating beauty. By engaging with art in a different way, we can use it to help us cope with and understand our personal struggles.
