I'm sorry about that. Here's another excerpt: The video defines emotional intelligence as the ability to recognize and understand emotions in oneself and others, and to use this awareness to manage one's behavior and relationships. It is composed of four domains: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management. Self-awareness is the foundation of emotional intelligence, as it allows individuals to recognize their own emotions and how they impact their thoughts and behavior. Self-management involves controlling one's emotional impulses and adapting to changing circumstances. Social awareness involves recognizing emotions in others and understanding their perspectives. Relationship management involves using emotional intelligence to communicate effectively and positively with others.

In this section, the importance of emotional intelligence is discussed and how it has not been given the prestige it deserves. Emotional intelligence allows people to confront problems with patience, insight, and imagination in effective relationships with others and themselves. We are urged to be skeptical of our emotions, and emotional intelligence is required to make the most of our emotions, recognize and interpret emotions in others, and resist being crushed by failure. Emotional education is necessary from a young age, and it should not just take place in classrooms; culture is the central vehicle for the transfer of emotional intelligence. Until we properly educate ourselves in emotional intelligence, we will not progress as a species and become ever greater technologically armed menaces to ourselves.
