In this section, the video explains attachment theory and how it classifies individuals into three categories based on their childhood experiences: securely attached, avoidant, and anxious people. Avoidant and anxious people are often drawn to each other, even though their emotional quirks contribute to a fraught situation. An anxiously attached person in a relationship might feel unappreciated or not loved and fall into moods of self-loathing or rejection. When they try to address their issues with the avoidant partner, it results in fights where the anxiously attached person loses their calm and exaggerates their points, leaving their partner feeling controlled and disconnected. Understanding one's unhealthy, trauma-driven behavior can help couples explain their actions to themselves and others and apologize for their antics before hurting one another.
