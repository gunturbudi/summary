In this section, the video focuses on six ideas from Eastern philosophy that aim to make us wiser, less agitated, more thoughtful, and appreciative of our lives. The first idea comes from Buddha's central noble truth that life is unavoidably about misery, and for one to be wise, they should grow completely at home with the ordinary shambles of existence. The second idea is Metta, which in the Indian language of Pali means benevolence, kindness or tenderness, and Buddhism recommends a daily ritual meditation to foster this attitude. The video then talks about one Yin, who is a saintly female figure occupying a similar role within Buddhism as the Virgin Mary does within Catholicism; her popularity speaks to the extent to which the needs of childhood endure within us. The fourth idea is Wu Wei, which means not making an effort, going with the flow, and implies an intentional surrender of the will based on a wise recognition of the need to accede, rather than protest against the demands of reality.
