Detail Summary: 
00:00:00
Niccolo Machiavelli was a 15th century political advisor and theorist who argued that we should not think of politicians as immoral, but as necessary for carrying out the goals of the state. He also wrote two books on the subject: The Prince and The Discourses. In The Prince, Machiavelli argues that it is almost impossible for a good politician to be good in a traditional Christian sense, and that the overwhelming responsibility of a good prince is to defend the state from external and internal threats. In The Discourses, he discusses how to be a good politician, and how to use criminal virtue (violence when necessary, done swiftly and often at night, repetition to avoid build up of reputation for mindless brutality) to keep people in check.
