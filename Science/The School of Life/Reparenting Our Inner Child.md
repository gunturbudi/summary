In this section, the concept of an inner child is explored. Although we age, an inner child remains, containing within us the versions of those we have been. Some of our inner children may be dealing with unresolved pain, which can cause psychic distress because they have been ignored, forgotten, and locked away. To correct this, we must reparent the inner child, identifying their troubles, providing kindness, reassurance, empathy, and warmth, and soothing their pains. By treating the inner child with compassion, tenderness, and tolerance, we can experience true liberation and rest more easily.
