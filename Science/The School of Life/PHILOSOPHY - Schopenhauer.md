This video discusses the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, particularly his concept of the "will to life." Schopenhauer believed that the will to life was a powerful force that focused on our own advantage and love, ultimately aiming to have children. However, he opposed having children if it meant sacrificing too much and preferred people to procreate only if they could produce "balanced children." Schopenhauer believed that art and philosophy could offer therapy for the unhappy turmoil created by the will to life. Despite once being relatively unknown, Schopenhauer's writings have left a lasting legacy, and he is viewed as a sage whose work should be revered like the Buddha's.

In this section, we learn about Arthur Schopenhauer's concept of the "will to life," which he believed was a primary force within us that is more powerful than our reasoned logic or moral sense. The will to life is a constant force that makes us focus on our own advantage, but most of all on sex. Schopenhauer believed that the ultimate aim of all love affairs is having children because love is connected to the most important underlying project of the will to life. However, he was deeply opposed to the boredom, expense, and the sheer sacrifice of having children, preferring that people procreate only if they can produce "balanced children." Schopenhauer believed that love casts itself on people who would apart from sex, be hateful, contemptible, and even abhorrent to us.

In this section, Schopenhauer's philosophy of life's ability to further its own ends rather than our happiness is highlighted, and how he felt deeply sorry for humans who are far more unhappy than animals. Schopenhauer offers two solutions, the first intended for sages and the second, more realistic therapy, being to spend as long as possible with art and philosophy which hold up a mirror to the unhappy turmoil created by the will to life. Schopenhauer's own work was deeply console and was fittingly morbid and pessimistic. Despite once failing to be famous and in good relationships, he found an audience who adored his writings, and lived quietly with his poodle Atman until his death, leaving behind a legacy as a sage whose bust should be revered like the Buddha's.
