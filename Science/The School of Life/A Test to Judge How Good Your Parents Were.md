This video discusses a test to judge how good your parents were based on eight principles. These principles include being understanding and patient, having the capacity for imaginative kindly explanations, and knowing how to be present and dignified around the house. The good parent doesn't need to be asked how their day was or what they think of the government's new policy on insurance, and knows that a child should be able to take a parent substantially for granted. The parents' reward for all their work won't ever be direct, it will arrive by noting in many years time that their child has just developed into a very good parent themselves.

The video discusses eight principles of good parenting. These principles include understanding that a young child's life revolves around "little details that are by any adult measure very minor," being patient, being understanding and forgiving, having a capacity for imaginative kindly explanations, learning the art of self-forgiveness, and allowing a child to be a bit weird. The good parent will also know how to be present and dignified around the house, while still being bratty sometimes.

The video discusses a test to judge how good your parents were. The test is designed to assess how well a child understands and takes care of their own needs. The video notes that a good parent will know how to appear very boring, understand that what a child chiefly needs is a source of reliable calm, take care to be predictable and to edit out at surprising moods, and be the privilege of every child not to have to know their parents in complete detail. The good parent isn't looking for a balanced relationship, happy to give unilaterally, doesn't need to be asked how their day was or what they think of the government's new policy on insurance, and knows that a child should be able to take a parent substantially for granted. The parents reward for all their work won't ever be direct, it will arrive by noting in many years time that their child has just developed into a very good parent themselves. Put simply, love is the considerate, tender, hugely patient behavior displayed by an adult over many years towards a child who cannot help but be largely out of control, confused, frustrated, and bewildered all in order that this child might over time grow into an adult who can take its place in society without too much of a loss of spontaneity
