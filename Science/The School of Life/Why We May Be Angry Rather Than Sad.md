The video discusses the theory that depression may not be caused by sadness but by unexpressed anger. People may have anger towards certain events or people but not be consciously aware of it and are taught that anger is not a good emotion, leading to depression. The video suggests that understanding this disavowed anger and turning unnameable sadness into specific hurt can help overcome depression without necessarily confronting the people or events that caused it.

In this section, the video discusses the theory that depression may not necessarily be caused by sadness, but by anger that has been unable to find expression. People may feel profound anger towards certain events or people without being aware of the causes or direction of their annoyance. This is because we are not good at understanding or keeping close tabs on the origin and nature of our feelings, and we have been taught that anger is not a nice emotion. The way to overcome depression is by turning the unnameable sadness into more specific hurt and understanding our disavowed rage and burden, even if we do not necessarily go out and confront the people or events that caused them.
