In this section, we learn about Ralph Waldo Emerson, known as the father of American literature, and how he fundamentally changed the way Americans saw their cultural and artistic possibilities. Despite his orthodox New England background as the son of a preacher, Emerson was strongly influenced by his self-taught and literary aunt, Mary Moody Emerson. After resigning from the church following his wife's death, he embarked on a trip to Europe where he had an epiphany about the importance of nature and also found the English romantic poets rather ordinary. These experiences led him to believe that nature and man are one and that everyone can recognize their significance as a uniquely human being. He became a professional lecturer and gave talks about natural history and literature around New England, advocating for originality and self-reliance, and rejecting tradition as limiting.

In this section, we learn about the philosophy of transcendentalism created by Ralph Waldo Emerson. According to Emerson, society hinders each individual's ability to discover their true nature by imposing burdens such as the past, tradition, and religion. He believed that by ridding ourselves of these burdens, we could discover our true selves and attain a connection with nature, which Emerson defined as God's existence in every part of creation. This philosophy led to the Transcendentalism movement, which emphasized the importance of the ordinary and led to American writers creating literary works about everyday life, such as Thoreau's Walden and Whitman's Leaves of Grass.
