# Summary of Earth's REAL Lost Continents

Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=NmFUFnMj5Jw

The video explores the idea that the Earth's true form can be revealed by removing water and understanding how continents tear apart and build new landmasses through volcanic activity. This results in above-sea level features such as islands and mountains. The video discusses various lost continents, such as Kerguelen and Broken Ridge, which could have had their own unique flora and fauna. The narrator also describes the formation of landmasses in the Pacific due to hot spots and plate tectonics. Additionally, the video explores landforms in the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, including the Rio Grande Islands, the Azores Plateau, and the Rockall Plateau.

In this section, the video discusses how the Earth's true form can be discovered by removing water from the equation and understanding how continents tear themselves apart, leaving behind fragments of their own bodies while magma pours out onto the surface to build new land forms. This results in above-sea level land features that we take notice of, such as islands or mountains. The largest submerged continental fragment, Zeelandia, is also explored, which is almost twice the size of Greenland and more than half the size of Australia. Shedding continental peripheral crust or being born underwater, like the Izu Bonin Mariana arc, are some other ways that elevated crust can make its way below sea level. Combined, these processes build up volcanic chains known as the Ring of Fire and lead to the emergence of what we call surreal lost land masses.

In this section, the focus is on the volcanic islands of the Pacific Ocean that have been shaped by plate tectonics and volcanism. While there are an estimated 25,000 islands in the Pacific, only the tallest, youngest and most volatile have survived, indicating how eager magma is to break out onto the Earth's surface. When magma is released through hot spots onto a moving oceanic plate, a chain of islands can be left behind, such as the Hawaiian Islands. Similarly shaped features demonstrate what direction the Pacific plate was moving in as it passed over these hot spots. It also shows that magmatic discharge is typically greatest at the beginning of a hotspot's life, and as the plume weakens over time, the islands diminish in size.

In this section, the video describes several lost continents, such as Kerguelen, which could have featured its own thriving exotic flora and fauna if enough precipitation was available. It is believed that the first people to inhabit Kerguelen were Europeans during the age of exploration. Broken Ridge, on the other hand, would have experienced a climate similar to southwestern Australia and likely would have been populated upon the Europeans' arrival. The 90 East Ridge, a single 5,000-kilometer-long landform created from a plate being dragged across a volcanic hot spot, covers an area of over 740,000 square kilometers. The video also discusses the messy breakup between India and Africa, which has led to the creation of several notable features in the Indian Ocean, such as the Mascarene Plateau and the Mozambique and Agulhas Plateaus.

In this section, the narrator discusses the Walvis Ridge and the Rio Grande Rise, two landmasses formed due to volcanic activity during the breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana. The Rio Grande Islands, part of the Rio Grande Rise, could have been home to unique rainforests and perhaps even human settlements before the arrival of Europeans. The narrator speculates that these islands may have been part of Portugal's Atlantic island empire and served as a stopover for Portuguese slave traders. The Azores Plateau is another landform born of volcanic activity in the Atlantic, and it is still being shaped by tectonic forces. Lastly, the video explores the Rockall Plateau north of Great Britain and Ireland, which represents the largest piece to come off the crumbling continental shelf and could have been a Celtic nation.
