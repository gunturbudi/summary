# Summary of The Problem With Africa's Borders

"The Problem With Africa's Borders" explores how the drawing up of borders during colonisation, without taking into account the divisions among Africans themselves, has resulted in intense competition over lands and civil wars, revolutions, and genocides within and between African nations. The continent's ethnic diversity has led to a breakdown of language families, with religion and language being key factors dividing the population. The concept of "big lines of Africa" based on religion, language, and race is presented as a potential solution, but the example of South Sudan highlights the difficulties in implementing this strategy. Despite the challenges, many African nations have become more peaceful since the 1970s.

In this section, the video explains that when Africa was divided by the Europeans during colonisation, they didn't take into account the divisions among the Africans themselves. Cohesive nations were divided, sometimes leading to intense competition over the lands collectively deemed as theirs. In the worst cases, these borders resulted in civil wars, revolutions, and genocides within and between African nations. The video then goes on to explore how drawing up borders in Africa is a difficult task due to the continent's ethnic diversity, but using common factors such as religion, language, and ancestry can be a good starting point for unifying the tribes and forming larger, stable nations.

In this section, we see that religion and language are key factors that divide the African continent. While African countries have a nearly equal number of Christians and Muslims, with both religions covering 15 million square kilometers, they have over 2,000 different languages and several major language families, further dividing the population. The Niger Congo language family alone has around 1,500 languages, the Afro-Asiatic family uses Arabic, and the Nilo-Saharan family is divided between two major groups. There are also two equally distinct but smaller language families, the COI son and Afrikaans languages. The breakdown of language families corresponds to specific racial groups, which is why race and language often go hand in hand with each other.

In this section, the video discusses the concept of "big lines of Africa", which are the borders that divide the continent based on religion, language, and race. The creation of these lines could lead to potentially more peaceful and stable countries entirely contained within these borders. However, the example of South Sudan raises questions about the effectiveness of this strategy, as this newest country has been plagued with a civil war, refugee crisis, famine, and ethnic violence. Ultimately, conflicts over resources, such as water and food, will still arise within African nations, no matter the borders. Despite the challenges, many African nations have steadily become more peaceful since the 1970s, which is reflected in the Global Peace Index.
