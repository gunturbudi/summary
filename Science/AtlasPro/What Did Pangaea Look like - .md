# Summary of What Did Pangaea Look like?

The video explores the supercontinent Pangaea, estimating what it looked like during the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event. The map is based on a time frame between 100 and 230 million years ago, and many mountains today did not exist during this time. The Panthalassa ocean dominated the world with a warmer temperature than modern times, determined by moisture balance. There would have been forests in areas with warm waters and deserts in areas with cold currents, savanna regions around the edges of the land, with the equatorial forest likely not crossing over the central Pangaea mountains. A map is created with available information, but collaboration and plant fossil analysis would be necessary for a more accurate reconstruction.

In this section, the video discusses the history of the concept of Pangaea and attempts to create a rough estimation of what this supercontinent looked like during the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event. Since Pangaea existed for around 160 million years, the map is based on a specific time frame between 100 and 230 million years ago. Many major mountains in the world today did not exist during this timeframe as they were formed because of the breaking apart of Pangaea. Therefore, the video explores some of the oldest mountain ranges still remaining on earth, such as the Appalachian Mountains, which would have formed a single, continuous mountain range called the Central Pangaean Range across the supercontinent. Other mountain ranges are also discussed, including the Andes, the Guiana Shield, and the Virgin Orogeny, which led to the growth of the Alps and the Pyrenees in Europe.

In this section, we learn about the oceans and ocean currents during the time of Pangaea, and how they could have influenced the climate and ecology of the land. We see that the Panthalassa ocean dominated the world during this time, with a separate body of water beginning to form, and although there isn't any concrete evidence for what the currents would have been like, we can reconstruct a general schematic for water circulation at the surface. We learn that the earth would have been a greenhouse earth with temperatures about 3 degrees Celsius warmer than modern times due to carbon dioxide concentrations around 5 times greater than what they are today. Additionally, with the absence of large temperate environments, moisture would have been the primary determining factor for the environment, balancing the lands of Pangaea.

In this section, the speaker discusses what Pangaea, the supercontinent that existed around 300 million years ago, may have looked like in terms of its environments. By using ocean currents and mountains as a guide, the speaker suggests that there would have been forests in areas with warm waters and deserts in areas with cold currents. The equatorial forest would likely not have crossed over the central Pangaea mountains, and this rainshadow effect would have prevented forests from moving too far into western Pangaea. Savanna regions would have existed around the edges of the land due to the moderating force of the ocean. The speaker creates a map of Pangaea with the information available, though acknowledges that the best reconstruction would require collaboration and analysis of plant fossils from the time.
