# Summary of The Problem With the USA's Borders

Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=hnaRppzurpw

The YouTube video "The Problem with the USA's Borders" argues that the United States should focus on its internal divides and borders, rather than expanding. The video provides examples of West Virginia, Nevada, and the Great Plains region, where borders were created without proper planning or consideration for the state's ability to sustain itself. The video calls for improved borders to ensure sustainability and tackles the possibility of the US having too many states, suggesting that instead, around 20 states based on natural drainage areas could work better. The video proposes redrawing borders based on natural barriers such as mountains and rivers, although it concludes that these ideas are unlikely to replace the current border model that works to a certain extent.

In this section, the history of America's expansion is discussed, covering the addition of states to the Union from the 13 original states in 1787 until the annexation of Hawaii in 1959. However, the video argues that America is no longer in a period of expansion and is instead experiencing a new era of optimization. Rather than looking outside its borders for ways to expand, the United States should focus on its internal divides and borders, which often leave certain states behind. The video uses West Virginia as an example of an underdeveloped state that suffers from its borders and geography, leading to fewer economic opportunities and a population decline. By reassessing these borders and taking into account how each state functions internally, the country as a whole could improve its ability to function.

In this section, the video discusses three examples of how the borders of some states in the US were created without proper planning or consideration for the state's ability to sustain itself. West Virginia's border was drawn quickly when it broke away from Virginia during the Civil War, resulting in a state that lacks self-sufficiency and may benefit from merging with a larger state. Meanwhile, Nevada's desert-like landscape is a result of its location within the Great Basin, making water access an issue for the state's growth, and its inclusion as a state during the Civil War was questionable due to its tiny population at the time. Lastly, the Great Plains region occupied by states such as Kansas and Iowa was transformed into a continuous farming powerhouse, leading to the question of why multiple states are required to govern such an area.

In this section, the speaker discusses how having multiple governments due to differently-sized states makes it difficult for cooperation between states, leading to decisiveness, and a lack of regulation on the use of water resources needed for agricultural production. With the draining of the Ogallala aquifer falling under the borders of eight different states, effective management of the reservoir is becoming difficult as each state benefits, making it hard for cooperation to happen. With a centralized authority, this can be combated with regulation from a higher authority, which would fall under a single entity, leading to better regulation to avoid scenarios like the tragedy of the commons. Improved borders need to be considered to ensure sustainability and the future of American states.

In this section, the video explores the possibility that the US may have too many states and considers ways to consolidate them. The approximate number of states needed in the US, based on the proportion of Europe's population over subdivisions, would be around 20 states. The video utilizes the US Geological Survey's 20-state arrangement, which ignores current state boundaries and focuses on the real hydrological units that constitute the land, creating each state around essentially one drainage area. This setup has several benefits, such as each state coming equipped with its own natural transportation routes, complete control over their water resources, attaining full water sovereignty, and no longer being dependent on management from multiple states or borrowing water from neighboring states. However, some anomalies or issues exist, such as the Southern border with Mexico, where the Rio Grande is used to define much of the country's Southern border.

In this section, the video discusses the flaws in the current state borders in the US. The problem with the Northern US is that the international US-Canada border does not follow river sources as with the Southern border- instead, it cuts through the Soros Red Rainy watershed, creating a fractured and unnavigable state that should be given to Canada in exchange for part of the US. John Wesley Powell suggested a similar blueprint for Western states over a century ago, but Congress did not approve it, and the current number of states do not adequately serve the current population of the US. The video argues that it may be fairer to redraw state borders to create a more equal representation and address issues of states dominating others. The video also brings up the examples of California and Texas, which have proposed dividing into multiple states.

In this section, we learn that dividing the country by linguistic, religious, or ethnic lines would not make sense. English is the most widely spoken language across the United States, even in areas where Spanish is the most popular second language. Christianity is the dominant religion, but different denominations split the country into several large pieces and smaller denominations. Focusing on ethnicity, we find that six groups represent more than 5% of the population: German, English, African, Mexican, Irish, and Italian. Still, no single ethnic group holds a majority anywhere in the country, and settlement patterns of each group are complicated, making the use of maps dividing the US by ethnicity, language, or religion plain inaccurate in defining specific regions of the country.

In this section, the video's narrator shares his own ideas on how the US borders should be redrawn based on natural barriers such as mountains and rivers. He suggests that the Appalachian Mountains section off the east coast from the Midwest, while the Rockies put an end to the prairie, and the Cascade Mountains distinguish the interior deserts from the coastal forests. Using rivers, he maps out 28 states plus Hawaii and Alaska, all with borders based on the natural landscape. However, he concludes that these ideas are unlikely to replace the current border model, which he believes continues to work up to a point.
