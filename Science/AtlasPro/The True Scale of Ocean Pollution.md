# Summary of The True Scale of Ocean Pollution

"The True Scale of Ocean Pollution" video explains the various ways the ocean is being polluted due to human actions. The three major categories of ocean pollution include atmospheric pollutants, chemical waste, and material waste. Chemical and nuclear waste has been disposed of in various oceans by several countries for decades, leading to the creation of maps detailing the specific locations where most of the waste has been dumped. The effects of ocean pollution have led to a reduction in fish hauls, lost tourist dollars, environmental damage, and adverse health issues. Governments and corporations must assume the responsibility of adequately addressing ocean pollution as it poses a risk to Homeland security and not just an environmental issue. At the same time, individuals must also play their part in keeping their communities and the ocean clean.

Detail Summary:

In this section, the speaker introduces the ocean's pollution problem, stating that the ocean is dirtier than most people think. While runoff from rain and rivers has always entered the oceans, modern civilization has added new pollutants like plastics, Sulfuric acid, chemical weapons, nuclear fuel, and heaps and heaps of trash, becoming a serious problem over time. Many pollutants have reached intolerable levels, making it hard for natural systems to handle the constant influx of filth. Ultimately, if the goal is to clean up the ocean, the first step is to understand the many ways in which we are polluting it.

In this section of the video transcript, the focus is on the issue of radioactive waste and its disposal in the ocean. The dumping of radioactive waste has been ongoing for decades, with records showing that most of the dumping was carried out by governments. This has allowed for accurate documentation of where most of the waste ended up, thus enabling the creation of maps detailing the exact locations where nuclear waste has been dumped. The United States kicked off this trend in 1946 when they sunk the waste products of the Manhattan Project into the ocean. Some countries such as Japan and European countries had their specific hot spots for waste disposal while the Soviet Union was responsible for almost two-thirds of all radioactive waste dumped into the ocean.

In this section, the video discusses how nuclear waste has been disposed of in the ocean. The United States packaged their waste into steel barrels which were insulated with concrete, while the Soviet Union allowed most of its nuclear waste to run off into surrounding areas and eventually into nearby rivers and seas. Nine nuclear submarines (two from the US, five from the Soviet Union, and two from Russia) have also been unintentionally sunk and are slowly breaking apart, spilling their nuclear fuel. The video presents a list of countries ordered by the amount of waste they've dumped into the ocean, with the Soviet Union being the biggest polluter, followed closely by the United Kingdom, and a distant third being Switzerland. However, the US may have unreported amounts of waste that were dumped, which makes it difficult to estimate how much was actually disposed of in the ocean.

In this section, the video explains the second major category of ocean waste, which is chemical waste. Chemical waste is considered the most daunting kind of pollution because us humans have been putting random chemicals into the ocean for thousands of years. The ocean is used to dispose of chemical weapons, radioactive waste, pesticides, oils spilled from offshore drilling, heavy metals like mercury, and fertilizers which can cause algal blooms followed by massive die-offs. The video uses nerve gas sunk into the ocean by the Russians as an example, but many developed nations including the US have dumped tons of chemicals into the ocean, littering the entire east coast with an arsenal of some of the deadliest weapons.

In this section of the video, the focus is on the disposal of chemical waste into the ocean. Nuclear waste and chemical weapons have been dumped into the Arctic Ocean, Kara Sea, Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Sea of Japan, and the North and Celtic Seas by various countries, leading to countless sites being full of deadly harmful agents. An interactive map is suggested to explore the full extent and severity of the issue. Pesticides, specifically DDT, also contaminate the ocean, often through being sprayed on fields and then carried by rain into rivers and ultimately into oceans. DDT was abruptly banned, forcing companies to dispose of it in the ocean. Up to half a million tonnes of barrels containing DDT sit in the ocean and are beginning to corrode and leak. Heavy metals and oil spills are also remarkably harmful to oceans. Additionally, oceanographers believe that rising CO2 levels caused by the burning of fossil fuels adversely affect coral reef growth.

In this section, the three categories of ocean pollution are discussed, specifically atmospheric pollutants, which include gases that end up in the atmosphere and can dissolve into rain droplets, causing acid rain that can drive many water inhabitants to the limits of their tolerance. Material waste is the most widespread form of pollution, afflicting riverbanks, coastlines, and the middle of the ocean. It consists of tire, mattress, bone, can, and plastic waste, which can eventually break down into microplastics that get taken into the bodies of animals and cause health issues for humans. Finally, the pollution caused by oil waste, inorganic farming runoff, and metal waste is discussed, with the impact on the ocean's inhabitants. Each category requires a different approach to remedy, with material waste being the easiest pollutant to clean up.

In this section, the focus is mainly on how we can prevent dissolved gases from entering the oceans, which are harmful to the marine ecosystem. The ocean acidification crisis is caused due to the burning of fossil fuels like carbon dioxide and sulfur oxides, leading to oceans absorbing more carbon and eventually becoming acidic. While reducing emissions is already underway, tackling radioactive and chemical waste is challenging, and the majority of these waste materials have already mixed with ocean water and cannot be filtered out. Governments and corporations must address the problem as it poses a risk to homeland security and not just an environmental issue. It is vital to prevent pollution from entering the oceans in the first place, and companies producing waste must take responsibility.

In this section, it is discussed how holding governments responsible for ocean pollution works for radioactive waste too but with one big exception. Unlike chemical weapons that were almost exclusively made by governments for military use, not all nuclear waste was. Some countries topped the charts despite not having a large or any nuclear weapons, and instead, most of their waste came from the manufacturing of advanced medical devices using radioactive materials. This means that while the responsibility primarily falls on governments, it also falls on companies and corporations that made money off of polluting the world's waters. Ultimately, although it might be free to dump waste in the ocean, it still comes with a price that is paid through environmental damage, reduced fish hauls, lost tourist dollars, adverse health issues, and more. Therefore, it is essential that both people and the many governments and corporations of the world do their fair share in cleaning up the mess they helped create.
