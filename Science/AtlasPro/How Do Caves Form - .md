# Summary of How Do Caves Form?

This video explores the way caves are formed, beginning with the accumulation of shells from sea creatures which turn into limestone. Rainwater, containing acid, dissolves the limestone and creates cavities over time. Karst topography is the process of cave formation and is most commonly seen in limestone areas, though any rock that dissolves in weak acids is capable of forming into a cave. As rainfall increases, karst topography will intensify, creating more caves and sinkholes in an area. Different types of caves may form depending on the size and shape of the rock layer, but all caves will have an entrance and exit point for water.

In this section, we learn about how caves are formed, starting with the buildup of a layer of shells from sea creatures that eventually becomes limestone. Rainwater carries acids as it falls to the ground and seeps into the soil, dissolving the limestone and creating cavities in the earth. This process can happen quickly, in geologic terms, with Hongseong Dule cave being only roughly three million years old. This cave is the largest on earth by volume, with 38.5 million cubic meters of empty space containing jungles, build lines, stalagmites, and cave pearls. Its name translates to “cave of the mountain river,” as a stream of water pours from the entrance and flows deep into the cave, said to be coming from within the mountain itself.

In this section, it's explained that limestone is the most common rock type for caves to form in, but any rock that dissolves in weak acids can also become caves given enough time. The process of cave formation is known as karst topography and takes place when water is able to dissolve the rock beneath the earth, creating hollow tubes and eventually caves. As more rainfall occurs in an area, more karst topography forms and the greater number of caves and sinkholes there will be. Depending on the size and shape of the limestone layer, different types of caves can be formed, but almost always a cave will have an entrance point where water can seep in and an exit point where water empties out.
