In this section, the significance of cities in human history is highlighted, as they enabled specialization, trade, and the creation of complex societies and cultures. The earliest recorded cities date back to around 9,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, and some of the largest cities in history existed in this region as well, such as Jericho and Uruk. The population of cities grew significantly during the Industrial Revolution, leading to over 50% of the world's population residing in urban areas by 2007. Despite being a recent development in human history, urbanization is predicted to continue with over 5 billion people expected to live in cities by 2030.

In this section, we learn about the early cities that held the title of "largest city on earth." From the ancient cities of Iraq to those in present-day Ukraine, it is difficult to discern which city was the biggest as they likely traded places often. By 3,000 BCE, Uruk had climbed to 40,000 people, and several large population centers had sprung up in the region. By 2,100 BCE, the city of Ur - in Iraq - had reached 100,000 people, likely for the first time in human history, and replaced Urk to become the most populous city on earth. From then on, it was a match of tug-of-war between the cities of China and the rest of the world, with Yuangju in China becoming the first city outside the Middle East region to hold the title of the world's largest city.

In this section, the video explores the biggest cities in history, starting with the city of Luo Yi in China and Babylon in Iraq, which were vying for the top spot in 700 BCE. By 100 BCE, Alexandria in Egypt had become the first city in history to reach a population of one million people, but shortly thereafter fell into decline, leading to Rome taking the top spot with a population of around one million people as well. The video also mentions the Punic Wars, which led to the destruction of Carthage and the enslavement of its inhabitants. The video concludes by teasing part two, which will cover the biggest cities in history after the fall of Rome.
