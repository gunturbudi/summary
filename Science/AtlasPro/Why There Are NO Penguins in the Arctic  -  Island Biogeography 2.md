# Summary of Why There Are NO Penguins in the Arctic | Island Biogeography 2

The video explains why penguins are not found in the Arctic. Penguins are adapted to the extreme and isolated environment of Antarctica due to their natural history of evolution on isolated islands. They survived the previous ice age, became isolated, and new waves of speciation occurred, leading to the emergence of the Emperor penguin, the largest modern species. Penguins need to adapt as they migrate from polar to subpolar to temperate to subtropical to tropical regions, and this takes time. Additionally, the Arctic has numerous predators, such as arctic foxes, arctic wolves, and polar bears, that make survival here much harder than at the South Pole. The video concludes that humans caused the extinction of the Great Auk, the original penguin that lived in the Arctic, and introducing penguins directly from the south to the north is not a good solution.

In this section, the video explains the history and evolution of penguins in order to understand why they do not inhabit the Arctic. Penguins are uniquely adapted to the extreme and isolated environment of Antarctica due to their natural history of evolution on isolated islands. They evolved from the weimanu, the common ancestor for all penguins, which gave up flying for an exceptional ability to swim, allowing them to colonize surrounding lands and diversify into at least 40 different species, some of which were giants. However, the earth started to change around 40 million years ago, gradually building up ice, which led to the diversification of penguin species in Antarctica. Nonetheless, they never colonized the Arctic, which is explored in the rest of the video.

In this section, the video explains how penguins survived the previous ice age, primarily because their seafaring ways taught them how to manage body heat in the changing climate in Antarctica. From here, with the continents drifting farther apart, penguins became isolated from each other and new waves of speciation occurred, leading to the emergence of the Emperor penguin, the largest modern species. As species spread to the South coast of Africa and Australia, they became more isolated, resulting in the emergence of the blue penguin, the smallest species. Penguins were able to make it to the tropics, so why haven't they made it back to the Arctic? The answer is complex due to the distance between the polar regions and our changing climate, but the happy reason is they are best suited for the Antarctic environment.

In this section, the video explains why there are no penguins in the Arctic. One reason is that the rate of colonization is low due to the massive geography differences between the North and South Poles. Penguins need to adapt as they migrate from polar to subpolar to temperate to subtropical to tropical regions, and this takes time. Moreover, as penguins continue to climb closer to the Arctic, they lose adaptations to the Mediterranean climate that made them suitable for life in the Arctic in the first place, because they need to adapt to survive in hotter areas. Additionally, the arctic has numerous predators, such as arctic foxes, arctic wolves, and polar bears, that make survival here much harder than at the South Pole. All of these factors result in a very low chance of penguins colonizing the Arctic.

In this section, we learn about the Great Auk, the original penguin that is now extinct. Like penguins in the south, the Great Auk gave up its wings to live in the harsh and cold Arctic region. However, the Great Auk did not colonize the Arctic due to predators, which also made it vulnerable while on land. A few breeding grounds were discovered, but because of their vulnerability, they occupied a much smaller niche within the animal community. Humans caused their extinction, hunting them for their pelts, and museum specimens, leading to their ultimate demise. By 1844, only a single small island off the southwest coast of Iceland called Elde hosted a population of the Great Auk, and it would be here that the birds would eventually drop to zero.

In this section, the video discusses the sad explanation of why there are no penguins in the Arctic. It turns out that there were penguins there, but humans killed them all. Just like the great auk, penguins were victims of their own isolation, and they would likely have seen the same fate if they had not been on the one continent humans had not colonized. The video suggests that humans are capable of astounding degrees of destruction, sometimes without even being aware of it, and need to learn and come to realize their destructive capacities to try to avoid them. However, the video concludes that introducing penguins directly from the south to the north is not a good solution because it would have potential unforeseen consequences, and penguins would compete with people for fish, which would endanger the local penguin populations.
