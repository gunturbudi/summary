# Summary of The Biogeography of the Oceans

Source: https://youtube.com/watch?v=WE2ukQOWBIw

In this video on the biogeography of the oceans, the speaker highlights the lack of a widely-accepted model of ocean life and the complexities surrounding the discipline of marine biogeography. The speaker explores the various ocean realms and describes how the abundance and distribution of primary producers, such as kelp, corals, and seagrasses, affect the formation of ecosystems and animal populations. The Southern Ocean is noted as the most distinct both geographically and biologically, with over half of the species found there being endemic to the region and dependent on plankton for primary production. The video ends with an advertisement for the streaming service Curiosity Stream and Nebula.

In this section, the video creator discusses the absence of a widely-accepted model of ocean life, unlike the biogeographic model used for terrestrial life. While marine biology is fascinating, something in their understanding seemed to be missing, and thus they became interested in marine biogeography. The creator discusses the complexities surrounding this discipline and how even in the 21st century, we still don't fully understand the ocean's vastness and richness of life. However, the World Wildlife Foundation produced a classification system called "Marine Eco Regions of the World," which conveniently provided us with a map and a deep dive into the environments of the oceans. Marine biogeography could be an effective tool to communicate why certain environments need protection, just as it has been used in protecting flora and fauna on land. Understanding marine geography is the first step towards building a biological component required for marine biogeography.

In this section, the video discusses how oceans are deserts except for areas where the sea floor rises to meet the sunlight, allowing for photosynthesizers to create a more productive environment. This results in ocean life conforming to the locations where water is supported by Continental shelves, creating a chain of ecosystems. The video suggests that the ocean should have one realm due to the lack of geographic separation between ocean ecosystems, yet there are 12 oceanic realms. The Arctic Ocean is discussed, where despite being shallow, the water is too cold for large photosynthetic organisms to grow. Instead, there are phytoplankton and zooplankton that form the foundation of the food web. The video explains how kelp forests in the temperate latitudes provide animals with niches not available in Arctic waters, creating rich habitats as productive as any rainforest.

In this section, the speaker explains how kelp support a larger population of grazers and predators, leading to similar animal populations in kelp forests across different ocean regions. However, primary producers vary between ocean environments, making them the distinguishing factor for biogeographical analysis. The speaker notes how temperate North Pacific realm and temperate Atlantic realm are similar due to their kelp-dominated shelves, but the Tropical Atlantic realm sees corals as the primary producer. Coral's ability to consume and photosynthesize simultaneously through symbiotic relationships with algae gives them a competitive edge over kelp, allowing them to form the foundation of tropical ocean ecosystems, while kelp dominates in nutrient-rich, cooler waters.

In this section, the video explains the biogeography of the oceans off the coasts of South America and Africa. The upwelling in these areas creates conditions that support the growth of kelp, but the separate temperate South American and temperate African realms have their own distinct characteristics. The West Indo-Pacific Realm covers the entire Indian Ocean and has many islands that sit atop volcanic plateaus, creating ideal conditions for coral reefs. However, in the case of the Saya de Maria Bank, seagrass dominates the area, which is unusual because it is a tropical location. The video suggests that the lack of kelp and coral in the area is due to the fact that the bank was once an island with soil, which now makes it impossible for coral and kelp to establish themselves, allowing sea grass to dominate.

In this section, the speaker discusses the distribution of seagrasses and how they occupy a different niche within the greater coral and kelp kingdoms. He notes that this could have led to the formation of ecoregions, but they don't qualify as their realms as they don't compete with other photosynthesizers. Moving towards the Central Indo-Pacific, the speaker highlights how the region was once a dry land that flooded due to rising global temperatures, leading to the largest expanse of shallow water in the world. The speaker notes that wherever there are exposed rocks breaking through the soil, huge coral reefs are supported, such as the Oppo Reef in the Philippines and the Great Barrier Reef off Australia. He further discusses the Southern Ocean Realm and how it might be the most distinct both geographically and biologically. Over half the species found here are endemic, living nowhere else on earth, and the Southern Ocean puts the burden of primary production entirely on plankton.
